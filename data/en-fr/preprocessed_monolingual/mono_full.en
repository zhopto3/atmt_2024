In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth .
The earth was without form and empty . Darkness covered the deep water . The Spirit of God hovered over the waters .
Then God said : » Let there be light ! « And there was light .
God saw that the light was good . God separated the light from the darkness .
God called the light day . He called the darkness night . There was evening and there was morning , one day .
Then God said : » Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters . Let it separate the waters from the waters . «
God made the expanse . He separated the waters that were below the expanse from the waters that were above the expanse . It was so .
God called the expanse heaven . There was evening and there was morning , a second day .
Then God said : » Let the waters below the atmosphere be gathered into one place . Let the dry land appear . « It was so .
God called the dry land earth . The gathering of the waters He called seas . God saw that it was good .
Then God said : » Let the earth sprout vegetation , plants yielding seed , and fruit trees on the earth bearing fruit after their kind with seed in them . « It was so .
The earth brought forth vegetation , plants yielding seed after their kind , and trees bearing fruit with seed in them , after their kind . God saw that it was good .
There was evening and there was morning , a third day .
Then God said : » Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night . Let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years .
» Let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth . « It was so .
God made the two great lights . The sun was to govern the day . The moon was to govern the night . He made the stars also .
He placed the lights in the sky to shine on the earth .
The lights were to govern the day and the night , and to separate light from darkness . God saw that it was good .
There was evening and there was morning , a fourth day .
God said : » Let the waters be filled with many kinds of living beings , and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the sky . «
God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves in the waters after their kind , and every winged bird after its kind . God saw that it was good .
God blessed them and said : » Be fruitful and multiply , and fill the waters in the seas , and let birds multiply on the earth . «
There was evening and there was morning , a fifth day .
God said : » Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds : livestock , creatures that move along the ground , and wild animals , each according to its kind . « It was so .
God made the wild animals according to their kinds . He made the livestock according to their kinds and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds . God saw that it was good .
Then God said : » Let us make man in our image , in our likeness . Let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air , over the livestock , over all the earth and over all the creatures that move along the ground . «
God created man in his own image . In the image of God he created him . He created male and female .
God blessed them and said to them : » Be fruitful and increase in number . Fill the earth and subdue it . Rule over the fish of the sea and dominate the birds of the air . Have dominion over every living creature that moves on the ground . «
Then God said : » I give you every plant that bears seed on the face of the entire earth . I also give you every tree that has fruit with seed in it . They will be yours for food .
» Also every beast of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the ground ; everything that has the breath of life in it , I give every green plant for food . « It was so .
God saw all that he had made . It was very good . There was evening , and there was morning , the sixth day .
The heavens and the earth and their immense arrangement were completed .
By the seventh day God had finished his work . He rested from all his work on the seventh day .
God blessed the seventh day and made it holy . This is because he rested from all the work of creation he had done .
This is the account of when Jehovah God created the heavens and the earth .
No shrub of the field had yet appeared on the earth . No plant of the field had yet sprung up , for Jehovah God had not sent rain on the earth . There was no man to work the ground .
Mist came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground .
Jehovah God formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life . The man became a living being .
Now Jehovah God planted a garden in the east , in Eden . He put the man he had formed there .
Jehovah God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground , trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food . In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil .
A river watering the garden flowed from Eden . From there it was separated into four headwaters .
The name of the first river is the Pishon . It winds through the entire land of Havilah , where there is gold .
The gold of that land is good . Bdellium and onyx stone are also there .
The name of the second river is the Gihon . It winds through the entire land of Cush .
The name of the third river is the Tigris . It runs along the east side of Asshur . The fourth river is the Euphrates .
Jehovah God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it .
Jehovah God commanded the man : » You are free to eat from any tree in the garden .
» But you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil . When you eat of it you will surely die . «
Jehovah God said : » It is not good for the man to be alone . I will make a helper suitable for him . «
Then Jehovah God formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air . He brought them to the man to let him name them . Whatever the man called each living creature , that was its name .
So the man gave names to all the livestock , the birds of the air and all the beasts of the field . But no suitable helper was found for Adam .
Jehovah God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep . While he was sleeping , he took one of the man’s ribs and closed up the place with flesh .
Then Jehovah made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man . He brought her to the man .
The man said : » This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh . She shall be called ‘ Woman . ’ ’ This is because she was taken out of Man . «
This is the reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife . They will become one flesh .
The man and his wife were both naked , and they felt no shame .
Now the serpent was craftier than any of the wild animals Jehovah God had made . He said to the woman : » Did God really say , you must not eat from any tree in the garden ? «
The woman said to the serpent : » We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden .
‘ » However , God did say : ‘ You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden . You must not touch it , or you will die . ’ «
» You will not die , « the serpent said to the woman .
» God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened . Then you will be like God , knowing good and evil . «
When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye , and also desirable for gaining wisdom , she took some and ate it . She also gave some to her husband , who was with her , and he ate it .
Then the eyes of both of them were opened . They realized they were naked . They sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves .
The man and his wife heard the sound voice of Jehovah God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day . They hid from Jehovah , among the trees of the garden .
But Jehovah God called to the man : » Where are you ? «
He Adam answered : » I heard you in the garden , and I was afraid because I was naked ; so I hid . «
And he said : » Who told you that you were naked ? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from ? «
Adam said : » The woman you put here with me gave me some fruit from the tree , and I ate it . «
Then Jehovah God said to the Eve : » What is this you have done ? « The woman answered : » The serpent deceived me , and I ate . «
So Jehovah God said to the serpent : » Because you have done this you are cursed above all the livestock and all the wild animals ! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life .
» And I will put enmity hostility hatred between you and the woman , and between your offspring seed and hers . He will bruise overwhelm crush you in the head , and you will bruise overwhelm crush him in the heel . «
He said to the woman : » I will greatly increase your pains in childbirth ; with pain you will give birth to children . Your desire will be for your husband , and he will rule over you . «
He said to Adam : » Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you , ‘ You must not eat of it , ’ ’ cursed is the ground because of you ; through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life .
» It will produce thorns and thistles for you . You will eat the plants of the field .
» You will eat your food by the sweat of your brow until you return to the ground . You came from the ground . For dust you are and to dust you will return . «
Adam named his wife Eve , because she would become the mother of all the living .
Jehovah God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them .
Jehovah said : » The man has now become like one of us , knowing good and evil . He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat , and live forever . «
Therefore Jehovah God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken .
After he drove the man out , he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life .
Adam had sexual intercourse with his wife Eve . She became pregnant and gave birth to Cain . She said : » With the help of Jehovah I have brought forth a man . «
Later she gave birth to his brother Abel . Now Abel kept flocks , and Cain worked the soil .
As time went by , Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to Jehovah .
But Abel brought fat portions from some of the firstborn firstlings of his flock . Jehovah looked with favor on Abel and his offering .
He did not look with favor on Cain and his offering . So Cain became very angry , and his face was downcast he had a bad attitude .
Jehovah said to Cain : » Why are you angry ? Why is your face downcast ?
» If you do what is right , will not your attitude improve ? But if you do not do what is right , sin is crouching at your door . It desires to have you , but you must master it . «
While they were in the field , Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him .
Jehovah asked Cain : » Where is your brother Abel ? « » I do not know , « he replied . » Am I my brother’s keeper ? «
Jehovah said : » What have you done ? Listen ! Your brother’s blood life cries out to me from the ground .
» Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground , which opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand .
» When you work the ground , it will no longer yield its crops for you . You will be a restless wanderer vagabond on the earth . «
Cain said to Jehovah : » My punishment is more than I can bear .
» You are driving me from the land today . I will be hidden from your presence . I will be a restless homeless wanderer on the earth . And whoever finds me will kill me . «
Jehovah replied to him : » If anyone kills Cain , he will suffer vengeance seven times over . « Then Jehovah put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him .
Cain went out from Jehovah’s presence and lived in the land of Nod Fugitiveness . Nod is east of Eden .
Cain had intercourse with his wife . She became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch . Later Cain built a city . He named it after his son Enoch .
To Enoch was born Irad , and Irad was the father of Mehujael , and Mehujael was the father of Methushael , and Methushael was the father of Lamech .
Lamech married two women , one named Adah and the other Zillah .
Adah gave birth to Jabal ; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock .
His brother’s name was Jubal ; he was the father of all who play the harp and flute .
Zillah also had a son , Tubal-Cain , who forged all kinds of tools out of copper and iron . Tubal-Cain’s sister was Naamah .
Lamech said to his wives : » Adah and Zillah , listen to me ; wives of Lamech , hear my words . I have killed a man for wounding me , a young man for injuring me .
» If Cain is avenged seven times , then Lamech seventy-seven times . «
Adam had intercourse with his wife again , and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth . She said : » God has granted me another child in place of Abel , since Cain killed him . «
Seth also had a son , and he named him Enosh . At that time men began to call on proclaim the name of Jehovah .
This is the written genealogy of Adam . When God created man , he made him in the likeness of God .
He created them male and female and blessed them . When they were created , he called them Mankind .
When Adam had lived one hundred and thirty years , he had a son in his own likeness , in his own image ; and he named him Seth .
After Seth was born , Adam lived eight hundred years and had other sons and daughters .
Altogether , Adam lived nine hundred and thirty years , and then he died .
Seth lived one hundred and five years when he became the father of Enosh .
After he became the father of Enosh , Seth lived eight hundred and seven years and had other sons and daughters .
Altogether , Seth lived nine hundred and twelve years , and then he died .
Enosh lived ninety years . He became the father of Kenan .
After he became the father of Kenan , Enosh lived eight hundred and fifteen years and had other sons and daughters .
Enosh lived a total of nine hundred and five years , and then he died .
Kenan lived seventy years . He became the father of Mahalalel .
After that Kenan lived eight hundred and forty years and had other sons and daughters .
Altogether , Kenan lived nine hundred and ten years , and then he died .
When Mahalalel lived sixty-five years , he became the father of Jared .
After he became the father of Jared , Mahalalel lived eight hundred and thirty years and had other sons and daughters .
Mahalalel lived a total of eight hundred and ninety-five years , and then he died .
When Jared lived one hundred and sixty-two years , he became the father of Enoch .
After he became the father of Enoch , Jared lived eight hundred years and had other sons and daughters .
Jared lived a total of nine hundred and sixty-two years , and then he died .
When Enoch lived sixty-five years , he became the father of Methuselah .
After he became the father of Methuselah , Enoch walked with God three hundred years and had other sons and daughters .
Altogether , Enoch lived three hundred and sixty-five years .
Enoch walked with God . Then he was no more , because God took moved him away .
When Methuselah lived one hundred and eighty-seven years , he became the father of Lamech .
After he became the father of Lamech , Methuselah lived seven hundred eighty-two years and had other sons and daughters .
Altogether , Methuselah lived nine hundred and sixty-nine years , and then he died .
When Lamech had lived one hundred and eighty-two years , he had a son .
He named him Noah . He said : » He will comfort us in the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the ground Jehovah has cursed . «
After Noah was born , Lamech lived five hundred and ninety-five years and had other sons and daughters .
Lamech lived a total of seven hundred seventy-seven years , and then he died .
After Noah was five hundred years old , he became the father of Shem , Ham , and Japheth .
Men began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them .
The sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful . They married any of them they chose .
Jehovah said : » My Spirit will not contend judge plead with man forever , for he is mortal and corrupt . Therefore his days will be a hundred and twenty years . «
The NEPHILIM were on the earth in those days , and also afterward , when the sons of God had sexual intercourse with the daughters of men and had children by them . They were the heroes of old , men of renown .
Jehovah saw how great man’s wickedness on the earth had become . Every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the time .
Jehovah was grieved that he had made man on the earth . His heart was grieved with pain .
So Jehovah said : » I will wipe mankind , whom I have created , from the face of the earth . All of them : men and animals , and creatures that move along the ground , and birds of the air . I am sorry that I created them . «
But Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah .
This is the ACCOUNT OF NOAH . Noah was a righteous man , blameless among the people of his time . He walked with God .
Noah had three sons : Shem , Ham , and Japheth .
The earth was corrupt in God’s sight . It was full of violence .
God saw how corrupt the earth had become . All the people on earth had corrupted their ways .
God said to Noah : » I am going to put an end to all people , for the earth is filled with violence because of them . I am going to destroy them with the earth .
» BUILD AN ARK of cypress wood a resinous tree . Make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out .
» This is how you are to build it : The ark is to be four hundred and fifty feet long , seventy-five feet wide , and forty-five feet high .
» Build a roof on it and finish the ark to within eighteen inches of the top . Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower , middle , and upper decks .
» I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens . Every creature that has the breath of life in it , everything on earth will perish .
» But I will establish my covenant with you . You will enter the ark , you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you .
» Bring into the ark two of all living creatures , male and female , to keep them alive with you .
» Two of every kind of bird , of every kind of animal , and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive .
» Take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them . «
Noah did everything exactly as God commanded him .
Jehovah said to Noah : » Go into the ark , you and your whole family . For I have found you righteous in this generation .
» Take with you seven of every kind of clean animal , a male and its mate , and two of every kind of unclean animal , a male and its mate .
» Also take seven of every kind of bird , male and female , to keep their various kinds alive throughout the earth .
» Seven days from now I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights . I will wipe from the face of the earth every living creature I have made . «
Noah did all that Jehovah commanded him .
Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters came on the earth .
Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood .
Pairs of clean and unclean animals , of birds and of all creatures that move along the ground ,
male and female came to Noah and entered the ark , as God had commanded Noah .
Seven days passed and the floodwaters came on the earth .
In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life , on the seventeenth day of the second month , on that day all the springs of the great deep burst forth , and the floodgates of the sky were opened .
Rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights .
Noah and his sons , Shem , Ham , and Japheth , together with his wife and the wives of his three sons , entered the ark .
They had with them every wild animal according to its kind , all livestock according to their kinds , every creature that moves along the ground according to its kind , and every bird according to its kind , everything with wings .
Pairs of all creatures that have the breath of life in them came to Noah and entered the ark .
The animals going in were male and female of every living thing , just as God had commanded Noah . Then Jehovah shut him in .
The flood came upon the earth for forty days . As the waters increased , they lifted the ark high above the earth .
The waters rose and increased greatly on the earth . The ark floated on the surface of the water .
They rose greatly on the earth , and all the high mountains under the entire heavens were covered .
The waters rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more than twenty feet .
Every living thing that moved on the earth perished : birds , livestock , wild animals , all the creatures that swarm over the earth , and all mankind .
Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died .
Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out . Men and animals and the creatures that move along the ground and the birds of the air were wiped from the earth . Only Noah was left , and those with him in the ark .
The waters flooded the earth for a hundred and fifty days .
God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and the livestock that were with him in the ark . He sent a wind over the earth , and the waters receded .
The springs of the deep and the floodgates of the skies were closed . So the rain stopped falling from the sky .
Water receded steadily from the earth . At the end of the hundred and fifty days the water had gone down .
On the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat .
The waters continued to recede until the tenth month . On the first day of the tenth month , the tops of the mountains became visible .
After forty days Noah opened the window he constructed in the ark .
He sent out a raven . It kept flying back and forth until the water dried up from the earth .
Then he sent out a dove to see if the water had receded from the surface of the ground .
The dove , however , could find no place to set its feet because there was water over all the surface of the earth . It returned to Noah in the ark . He reached out his hand and held the dove and brought it back to himself in the ark .
He waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark .
When the dove returned to him in the evening , there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf ! Then Noah knew that the water had receded from the earth .
He waited seven more days and sent the dove out again , but this time it did not return to him .
By the first day of the first month of Noah’s six hundred and first year , the water had dried up from the earth . Noah then removed the covering from the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry .
By the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was completely dry .
God said to Noah :
» Come out of the ark , you and your wife and your sons and their wives .
» Bring out every kind of living creature that is with you , the birds , the animals , and all the creatures that move along the ground . They will multiply on the earth and be fruitful and increase in number upon it . «
Noah came out , together with his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives .
All the animals and all the creatures that move along the ground and all the birds , everything that moves on the earth came out of the ark , one kind after another .
Noah built an altar to Jehovah and , taking some of all the clean animals and clean birds , he sacrificed burnt offerings on it .
Jehovah smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart : » Never again will I curse the ground because of man , for the intent of his heart is evil from childhood . I will never again destroy every living creature , as I have done .
» As long as the earth endures , seedtime and harvest , cold and heat , summer and winter , day and night , will never cease . «
God blessed Noah and his sons . He said : » Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth .
» All the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air will be filled with fear and dread of you . Every creature that moves along the ground and all the fish of the sea are placed under your control .
» Everything that lives and moves will be food for you . Just as I gave you the green plants , I now give you everything .
» You must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it .
» I will require your lifeblood as an accounting . I will demand an accounting from every animal . I will demand an accounting from each man for the life of his fellow man .
» Whoever sheds the blood of man will have his blood shed by man . For man was made in the image of God .
» You should be fruitful and increase in number . Multiply increase on the earth . «
Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him :
» I now establish my covenant with you and with your descendants after you
" and with every living creature that was with you , the birds , the livestock , and all the wild animals , all those that came out of the ark with you , every living creature on earth .
» I establish my covenant with you : Never again will the waters of a flood destroy all life . Never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth . «
God said : » This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you , a covenant for all generations to come :
» I give you my rainbow in the clouds . It will be the sign of my covenant with the world of mankind .
» Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds ,
» I will remember my covenant with you and all living creatures of every kind . Never again will the waters flood to destroy all life .
» Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds , I will see it and remember the long lasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth . «
God said : » This is the sign of the covenant I have established with all life on the earth . «
Noah’s sons who came out of the ark were Shem , Ham , and Japheth . Ham was the father of Canaan .
These were the three sons of Noah , and from them came the people who were scattered over the earth .
Noah , a man of the soil , planted a vineyard .
He drank some of its wine . He became drunk and lay undressed inside his tent .
Ham , father of Canaan , saw his father’s nakedness and told his two brothers outside .
Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it across their shoulders . Then they walked in backward and covered their father’s nakedness . Their faces were turned the other way so that they would not see their father’s nakedness .
Noah awoke from his wine and found out what his youngest son had done to him .
He Noah said : » Canaan is cursed ! He will be a lowly slave to his brothers . «
He also said : » Blessed be Jehovah , the God of Shem ! May Canaan be the slave of Shem .
» May God extend the territory of Japheth . And may Japheth live in the tents of Shem , and may Canaan be his slave . «
After the flood , Noah lived three hundred and fifty years .
Noah lived a total of nine hundred and fifty years , and then he died .
This is the genealogy of Shem , Ham , and Japheth , Noah’s sons , who also had sons after the flood .
The sons of Japheth : Gomer , Magog , Madai , Javan , Tubal , Meshech , and Tiras .
The sons of Gomer : Ashkenaz , Riphath , and Togarmah .
The sons of Javan : Elishah , Tarshish , Kittim , and Rodanim Dodanim .
From these the maritime peoples spread out into their territories by their clans within their nations , each with its own language .
The sons of Ham : Cush , Mizraim Egypt , Put , and Canaan .
The sons of Cush : Seba , Havilah , Sabtah , Raamah , and Sabteca . The sons of Raamah : Sheba and Dedan .
Cush was the father of Nimrod , who grew to be a mighty warrior on the earth .
He was a mighty hunter before Jehovah . That is why it is said : » Like Nimrod , a mighty hunter before Jehovah . «
The first centers of his kingdom were Babylon , Erech , Accad , and Calneh , in Shinar .
From that land he went to Assyria , where he built Nineveh , Rehoboth-Ir , Calah ,
and Resen , which is between Nineveh and Calah ; that is the great city .
Mizraim was the father of the Ludites , Anamites , Lehabites , Naphtuhites ,
Pathrusites , Casluhites , and Caphtorites .
Canaan was the father of Sidon his firstborn , and of the Hittites ,
Jebusites , Amorites , Girgashites ,
Hivites , Arkites , Sinites ,
Arvadites , Zemarites , and Hamathites . Later the Canaanite clans scattered ,
and the borders of Canaan reached from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza , and then toward Sodom , Gomorrah , Admah , and Zeboiim , as far as Lasha .
These are the sons of Ham by their clans and languages , in their territories and nations .
Sons were also born to Shem , whose older brother was Japheth . Shem was the ancestor of all the sons of Eber .
The sons of Shem : Elam , Asshur , Arpachshad , Lud and Aram .
The sons of Aram : Uz , Hul , Gether , and Meshech .
Arpachshad was the father of Shelah , and Shelah the father of Eber .
Two sons were born to Eber . One was named Peleg , because in his time the earth was divided . His brother was named Joktan .
Joktan was the father of Almodad , Sheleph , Hazarmaveth , Jerah ,
Hadoram , Uzal , Diklah ,
Obal , Abimael , Sheba ,
Ophir , Havilah , and Jobab . All these were sons of Joktan .
The region where they lived stretched from Mesha toward Sephar , in the eastern hill country .
These are the sons of Shem by their clans and languages , in their territories and nations .
These are the clans of Noah’s sons , according to their lines of descent , within their nations . From these the nations spread out over the earth after the flood .
The entire world had one language and common words .
As men moved eastward , they found a plain in Shinar Babylon and settled there .
They said to each other : » Let us make bricks and bake them thoroughly . « They used brick instead of stone , and tar for mortar .
Then they said : » Let us build ourselves a city , with a lofty tower that reaches into space , so that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth . «
But Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower that the men were building .
Jehovah said : » If they become one people speaking the same language , nothing will be impossible for them . They have begun to do this .
» Let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other . «
Jehovah scattered them from there over all the earth . They stopped building the city .
That is why it was called Babel confusion because Jehovah confused the language of the whole world . Jehovah scattered them from there over the face of the whole earth .
This is the genealogy of Shem . Two years after the flood , when Shem was one hundred years old , he became the father of Arpachshad .
After he became the father of Arpachshad , Shem lived five hundred years and had other sons and daughters .

Terah lived seventy years . He became the father of Abram , Nahor , and Haran .
This is the genealogy of Terah . Terah became the father of Abram , Nahor , and Haran . And Haran became the father of Lot .
While his father Terah was still alive , Haran died in Ur of the Chaldeans , in the land of his birth .
Abram and Nahor both married . The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai , and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milcah . She was the daughter of Haran , the father of both Milcah and Iscah .
Now Sarai was barren . She had no children .
Terah took his son Abram , his grandson Lot , son of Haran , and his daughter-in-law Sarai , the wife of his son Abram , and together they set out from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to Canaan . But when they came to Haran , they settled there .
Terah lived two hundred and five years . He died in Haran .
Jehovah said to Abram : » Leave your country , your people , and your father’s household , and go to the land I will show you .
» I will make you into a great nation . I will bless you . I will make your name great . You will be a blessing .
» I will bless those who bless you . I will curse whoever curses you . All the people on earth will be blessed through you . «
So Abram left , just as Jehovah told him . Lot went with him . Abram was seventy-five years old when he set out from Haran .
He took his wife Sarai , his nephew Lot , all the possessions they had accumulated and the people they had acquired in Haran . They set out for the land of Canaan and soon arrived there .
Abram traveled through the land as far as the site of the great oak tree of Moreh at Shechem . At that time the Canaanites were in the land .
Jehovah appeared to Abram and said : » I will give this land to your offspring seed . « He built an altar there to Jehovah , who had appeared to him .
From there he went on toward the hills east of Bethel and pitched his tent . Bethel was on the west and Ai on the east . He built an altar to Jehovah and called on the name of Jehovah .
Abram continued toward the Negev .
There was a famine in the land . Abram went down to Egypt to live there for a while , because the famine was severe .
He was about to enter Egypt . He said to his wife Sarai : » I know what a beautiful woman you are .
» When the Egyptians see you , they will say : ‘ This is his wife . ’ ’ Then they will kill me , but will let you live .
» Say you are my sister , so that I will be treated well for your sake , and my life will be spared because of you . «
When Abram came to Egypt , the Egyptians saw that she was a very beautiful woman .
Pharaoh’s officials saw her . They praised her to Pharaoh . She was taken into his palace .
He treated Abram well for her sake . Abram acquired sheep and cattle , male and female donkeys , menservants and maidservants , and camels .
Jehovah inflicted serious diseases on Pharaoh and his household because of Abram’s wife Sarai .
So Pharaoh summoned Abram . » What have you done to me ? « he asked . » Why did you not tell me she was your wife ?
» Why did you say : ‘ She is my sister , ’ ’ so that I took her to be my wife ? Now then , here is your wife . Take her and go ! «
Pharaoh gave orders about Abram to his men , and they sent him on his way , with his wife and everything he had .
Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev , with his wife and everything he had , and Lot went with him .
Abram had become very wealthy in livestock and in silver and gold .
He traveled from place to place from the Negev until he came to Bethel , to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had been earlier .
This was where he had first built an altar . There Abram called on the name of Jehovah .
Lot moved about with Abram . He also had flocks and herds and tents .
But the land could not support them while they stayed together . Their possessions were so great that they were not able to stay together .
Quarreling arose between Abram’s herdsmen and the herdsmen of Lot . The Canaanites and Perizzites were also living in the land at that time .
Abram said to Lot : » Let us not have any quarreling between you and me , or between your herdsmen and mine , for we are brothers .
» Is not the whole land before you ? Let us part company . If you go to the left , I will go to the right . If you go to the right , I will go to the left . «
Lot looked up and saw that the district of the Jordan River was well watered , like the garden of Jehovah , like the land of Egypt , toward Zoar . This was before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah .
So Lot chose for himself the whole plain of the Jordan and set out toward the east . The two men parted company :
Abram lived in the land of Canaan , while Lot lived among the cities of the plain and pitched his tents near Sodom .
The men of Sodom were wicked and sinned greatly against Jehovah .
After Lot had parted from Abram , Jehovah said to Abram : » Lift up your eyes from where you are and look north and south , east and west .
» All the land that you see I will give to you and your offspring descendants from generation to generation .
» I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth . If anyone could count the dust , your offspring could be counted .
» Go walk through the length and breadth of the land that I am giving to you . «
Abram moved his tents and went to live near the great trees of Mamre at Hebron . He built an altar to Jehovah there .
In the days of King Amraphel of Shinar , King Arioch of Ellasar , King Chedorlaomer of Elam , and King Tidal of Goiim ,
these four kings made war with King Bera of Sodom , King Birsha of Gomorrah , King Shinab of Admah , King Shemeber of Zeboiim , and the king of Zoar .
These joined forces in the Valley of Siddim at the Dead Sea .
They served Chedorlaomer for twelve years . They rebelled in the thirteenth year .
In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came and subdued the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim , the Zuzim in Ham , the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim ,
and the Horites in the hill country of Seir as far as El-paran on the edge of the wilderness .
They turned back and came to En-mishpat Kadesh , and subdued all the country of the Amalekites , and also the Amorites who lived in Hazazon-tamar .
Then the king of Sodom , the king of Gomorrah , the king of Admah , the king of Zeboiim , and the king of Zoar went out , and they joined battle in the Valley of Siddim .
They fought against King Chedorlaomer of Elam , King Tidal of Goiim , King Amraphel of Shinar , and King Arioch of Ellasar , four kings against five .
The Valley of Siddim was full of bitumen tar pits . As the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled , some fell into them . The rest fled to the hill country .
The enemy took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah , and all their food provisions , and went their way .
They also captured Lot , son of Abram’s brother , who lived in Sodom , and his goods , and departed .
Then one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew . He was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite , brother of Eshcol and of Aner . They were Abram’s allies .
Abram heard that his nephew had been taken captive . Abram led his trained men , born in his house , three hundred eighteen of them , in pursuit as far as Dan .
He divided his forces against them by night . He and his servants routed them and pursued them to Hobah , north of Damascus .
Then he brought back all the goods . He also brought back his nephew Lot and all the men and women .
As soon as the king of Sodom returned from defeating Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him , he went out to meet Abram at the King's Valley of Shaveh .
King Melchizedek of Salem brought out bread and wine . He was priest of God Most High .
He blessed him and said : » Blessed be Abram by God Most High , maker of heaven and earth .
» Blessed be God Most High , who has delivered your enemies into your hand ! « Abram gave him one tenth of everything .
Then the king of Sodom said to Abram : » Give me the people , but take the goods for yourself . «
But Abram said to the king of Sodom : » I have sworn to Jehovah , God Most High , maker of heaven and earth :
" I will take nothing . Not a thread or a sandal strap . You will not be able to say : ' I have made Abram rich . ’
» Let the young men who came with me take their portion : Aner , Eshcol , and Mamre . «
The word of Jehovah came to Abram in a vision : » Do not be afraid , Abram ; I am your shield . Your reward shall be very great . «
Abram said : » O Jehovah God , what will you give me ? I continue childless ! The heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus . «
Abram also said : » You have given me no offspring . So a slave born in my house is to be my heir . «
The word of Jehovah came to him : » This man shall not be your heir . No one but your very own issue shall be your heir . «
He brought him outside and said : » Look toward heaven and count the stars . Are you able to count them ? « He continued : » So shall your descendants be . «
He believed in Jehovah . Jehovah considered Abram’s faith as his righteousness .
Then God said to him : » I AM JEHOVAH , who brought you from Ur of the Chaldeans , to give you this land to possess . «
Abram replied : » O Jehovah God , how will I know that I shall possess it ? «
He God said to him : » Bring me a heifer three years old , a female goat three years old , a ram three years old , a turtledove , and a young pigeon . «
Abram brought him all these and cut them in two , laying each half over against the other . He did not cut the birds in two .
When birds of prey came down on the carcasses , Abram drove them away .
As the sun was going down , a deep sleep fell upon Abram , and a deep and terrifying darkness descended upon him .
Jehovah said to Abram : » Know this for sure ; your offspring will be strangers aliens in a land that is not theirs . They will be slaves there , and they shall be oppressed for four hundred years .
» I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve ! Afterward they will come out with great possessions .
» As for yourself , you shall go to your ancestors in peace . You shall be buried at a good old age .
» They shall come back here in the fourth generation . The iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete . «
The sun went down and it was dark . A smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces .
On that day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram . He said : » To your descendants I give this land , from the river of Egypt to the great river , the river Euphrates ,
the land of the Kenites , the Kenizzites , the Kadmonites ,
the Hittites , the Perizzites , the Rephaim ,
the Amorites , the Canaanites , the Girgashites , and the Jebusites . «
Sarai , Abram’s wife , had borne him no children . She had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar .
She said to Abram : » Jehovah has kept me from having children . Go sleep with my maidservant . Perhaps I can build a family through her . « Abram agreed to what Sarai said .
After Abram lived in Canaan ten years , Sarai , his wife , gave her Egyptian maidservant Hagar to her husband to be his wife .
Abram had intercourse with Hagar , and she conceived . When she knew she was pregnant , she began to despise her mistress .
Then Sarai said to Abram : » You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering . I put my servant in your arms ; she knows she is pregnant and she despises me . May Jehovah judge between you and me . «
» Your servant is in your hands , « Abram said . » Do with her whatever you think best . « Then Sarai mistreated Hagar . So she ran away from her .
The angel of Jehovah found Hagar near a spring in the desert . It was the spring that is beside the road to Shur .
He said : » Hagar , servant of Sarai , where have you come from , and where are you going ? « » I am running away from my mistress Sarai , « she answered .
Then the angel of Jehovah told her : » Go back to your mistress and submit to her .
» I will so increase your descendants that they will be too numerous to count . «
Jehovah’s angel also said : » You are now with child and you will have a son . You shall name him Ishmael means : God hears . Jehovah has heard of your misery .
» He Ishmael will be a wild donkey of a man . His hand will be against everyone and everyone’s hand against him . He will live in hostility toward all his brothers . «
She called the name of Jehovah , who spoke to her : » You are the God who sees me , for she said , ‘ I have not seen the one who sees me . ’ "
That is why the well was called Beer Lahai Roi Well of the Living One Who Sees Me . It is still there , between Kadesh and Bered .
Hagar bore Abram a son . Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne .
Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael .
Abram was ninety-nine years old . Jehovah appeared to him and said : » I am God Almighty . Walk before me and be blameless .
» I will establish my covenant between us . I will greatly increase your numbers . «
Abram fell on his face and God said to him :
» This is my covenant with you : You will be the father of many nations .
» You will no longer be called Abram Exalted Father . Your name will be Abraham means Father of Many . I have made you a father of many nations .
» I will make you very fruitful . I will make nations of you , and kings will come from you .
» I will establish my covenant as a long lasting covenant between us . It will be for your descendants after you , for the generations to come . I will be your God and the God of your descendants after you .
» The whole land of Canaan , where you are now a guest alien foreigner stranger , I will give a long lasting possession to you and your descendants after you . I will be their God . «
Then God said to Abraham : » As for you , you must keep my covenant , you and your descendants after you for the generations to come .
» This is my covenant with you and your descendants after you , the covenant you are to keep : Every male among you shall be circumcised .
» You are to undergo circumcision . It will be the sign of the covenant between us .
» For the generations to come every male among you who is eight days old must be circumcised . This includes those born in your household or bought with money from a foreigner , those who are not your offspring .
» Whether born in your household or bought with your money , they must be circumcised . My covenant in your flesh is to be a long lasting covenant .
» Any male not circumcised in the flesh will be cut off from his people . He has broken my covenant . «
God continued : » Do not call your wife Sarai any longer . Her name will be Sarah .
» I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her . I will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations . Kings of peoples will come from her . «
Abraham fell to his face . He laughed and said to himself : » Will a son be born to a man a hundred years old ? Will Sarah bear a child at the age of ninety ? «
Abraham said to God : » If only Ishmael might live under your blessing ! «
God replied : » Yes , but your wife Sarah will bear you a son ! You will call him Isaac . I will establish my covenant with him as a long lasting covenant for his descendants after him .
» Concerning Ishmael , I have heard you : I will surely bless him . I will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his numbers . He will be the father of twelve rulers , and I will make him into a great nation .
» But my covenant I will establish with Isaac . Sarah will bear him to you by this time next year . «
When he finished speaking with Abraham , God went up from him .
On that very day Abraham took his son Ishmael and all those born in his household or bought with his money , every male in his household , and circumcised them , as God told him .
Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised .
His son Ishmael was thirteen .
Abraham and his son Ishmael were both circumcised on that same day .
Every male in Abraham’s household , including those born in his household or bought from a foreigner , was circumcised with him .
Jehovah appeared again to Abraham by the oak grove of Mamre . He was sitting in the tent door in the heat of the day .
He looked up and noticed three men coming toward him . He ran from the tent door to meet them , and bowed to the ground .
Abraham said : » My Lord , if I have now found favor in your sight , do not pass by your servant .
» Please . Let a little water be brought . Wash your feet and rest under the tree .
» I will bring a bite to eat to refresh you . Stay a while before you continue your journey . « They responded : » Very well , do as you have said . «
Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said : » Quick ! Make ready three measures of fine meal ; knead it and make cakes . «
Then Abraham ran to the herd . He selected a fat calf and told a servant to butcher it and prepare it .
He took butter and milk and the calf that he had prepared , and set it before them . He stood by them under the tree as they ate .
Then they said to him : » Where is Sarah your wife « ? He responded : » Here , in the tent . «
He said : » Next year I will give you and Sarah a son . « Sarah was listening in the tent door behind him .
Abraham and Sarah were old , well advanced in age . Sarah had passed the age of childbearing .
Therefore Sarah laughed within herself . She said to herself : " After I have grown old , shall I have a baby ? My lord is old also . "
Jehovah said to Abraham : » Why did Sarah laugh , saying , ' Shall I surely bear a child , since I am old ? '
» Is anything too hard for Jehovah ? At the appointed time I will return to you , according to the time of life . Sarah shall have a son ! «
Sarah denied saying : » I did not laugh ! « She was afraid . He said : » But you did laugh ! «
Then the men stood up from their meal and started in the direction of Sodom . Abraham went with them to send them on the way .
Jehovah said : » Shall I hide what I am doing from Abraham ?
» Abraham will definitely become a great and mighty nation , and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him .
» I have chosen him , that he may command his children and his household ; and that they may remain in the righteous and just way of Jehovah . Jehovah will bring to Abraham what he told him . «
Jehovah said : » Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great , and because their sin is very grave ,
» I will go down now and see whether they have done the bad things I have been told . Then I will know . «
The men left there and went toward Sodom . Abraham still stood before Jehovah .
Abraham came near and said : » Will you destroy the righteous with the wicked ?
» Suppose there were fifty righteous within the city . Would you also destroy the place and not spare it because the righteous people are there ?
» Surely you would not do that ! Would you slay the righteous with the wicked , so that the righteous should be as the wicked ? Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right ? «
Jehovah said : » If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city , I will spare the entire place for their sakes . «
Then Abraham answered and said : » Indeed now , I who am only dust and ashes have taken it upon myself to speak to Jehovah :
» Suppose there were five less than the fifty righteous . Would you destroy the entire city for lack of five ? « So He God said : » If I find there forty-five , I will not destroy it . «
Abraham spoke again : » Suppose there should be forty found there ? « God replied : » I will not do it for the sake of forty . «
Abraham then said : » Do not be angry , and let me speak . Suppose thirty should be found there ? « God replied : » I will not do it if I find thirty there . «
Abraham then said : » Indeed now , I have taken it upon myself to speak to Jehovah : Suppose twenty should be found there ? « God replied : » I will not destroy it for the sake of twenty . «
Abraham again queried : » Please do not be angry as I speak once more : Suppose ten should be found there ? « God said : » I will not destroy it for the sake of ten . «
Jehovah went his way as soon as he finished speaking with Abraham . Abraham returned to his place .
That evening the two angels came to the entrance of the city of Sodom . Lot was sitting there as they arrived . When he saw them , he got up to greet them . Then he welcomed them and bowed low to the ground .
» My lords , « he said , » come to my home to wash your feet , and be my guests for the night . You may get up in the morning as early as you like and be on your way again . « » Oh no , « they said , » We will spend the night out here in the city square . «
Lot insisted , so at last they went home with him . He set a great feast before them , complete with fresh unleavened unfermented bread .
They prepared to retire for the night when suddenly all the men of Sodom , young and old , came from all over the city and surrounded the house .
They shouted to Lot : » Where are the men who came to spend the night with you ? Bring them out so we can have sex with them ! «
Lot stepped outside to talk to them , shutting the door behind him .
» Please , my brothers , « he begged , » do not do such a wicked thing .
» I have two virgin daughters . Do with them as you wish , but leave these men alone , for they are under my protection . «
» Stand back ! « they shouted . » Who do you think you are ? We let you settle among us , and now you are trying to tell us what to do ! We will treat you far worse than those other men ! « They pushed Lot and began breaking down the door .
But the two angels reached out and pulled Lot in and bolted the door .
Then they blinded the men of Sodom so they could not find the doorway .
» Do you have any other relatives here in the city ? « The angels asked . » Get them out of this place , sons-in-law , sons , daughters , or anyone else .
» We will destroy the city completely . The stench of the place has reached Jehovah . He has sent us to destroy it . «
Lot rushed out to tell his sons-in-law : » Hurry ! Get out of the city ! Jehovah is going to destroy it . « But the young men thought he was only joking .
At dawn the next morning the angels became insistent . They said to Lot : » Hurry ! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here . Get out of here right now , or you will be caught in the destruction of the city . «
Lot still hesitated . So the angels seized his hand and the hands of his wife and two daughters and rushed them to safety outside the city , for Jehovah was merciful .
» Run for your lives ! « The angels warned . » Do not stop and do not look behind you ! Escape to the mountains , or you will die . «
» Oh no , my lords , please , « Lot begged .
» You have been so kind to me and saved my life , and you have granted me such mercy . But I cannot go to the mountains . Disaster would catch up to me there , and I would soon die .
» There is a small village nearby . Please let me go there instead . Do you see how small it is ? Then my life will be saved . «
The angel said to him : » All right , I will grant you this request too . I will not destroy the city you are talking about .
» Run there quickly ! I cannot do anything until you get there . " The city is named Zoar Small .
The sun had just risen over the land as Lot came to Zoar .
Jehovah made burning sulfur and fire rain out of the sky on Sodom and Gomorrah .
He destroyed those cities , the whole Plain , all who lived in the cities , and whatever grew on the ground .
Lot’s wife looked back and turned into a pillar of salt .
Early the next morning Abraham came to the place where he had stood in front of Jehovah .
He looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the land in the Plain . He saw smoke rising from the land like the thick smoke of a furnace .
When God destroyed the cities of the valley where Lot was living , he kept Abraham in mind and allowed Lot to escape to safety .
Lot was afraid to stay in Zoar . So he and his two daughters moved up into the hills and lived in a cave .
The older daughter said to her sister : » Our father is getting old . There are no men in the whole world to marry us so we can have children .
» Come , let us get our father drunk . Then we can sleep with him and have children by him . «
That night they gave him wine to drink . The older daughter had intercourse with him . But he was so drunk that he did not know it .
The next day the older daughter said to her sister : » I slept with him last night . Let us get him drunk again tonight , and you sleep with him . Then each of us will have a child by our father . «
So that night they got him drunk . The younger daughter had intercourse with him . Again he was so drunk that he did not know it .
Both of Lot’s daughters became pregnant by their own father .
The older daughter had a son , whom she named Moab . He was the ancestor of the present-day Moabites .
The younger daughter also had a son , whom she named Ben-ammi . He was the ancestor of the present-day Ammonites .
Abraham moved from Mamre to the southern part of Canaan and lived between Kadesh and Shur . Later , while he was living in Gerar ,
he said that his wife Sarah was his sister . So King Abimelech of Gerar had Sarah brought to him .
God appeared to the king in a dream and said : » You are going to die , because you have taken this woman . She is already married . «
Abimelech had not come near her . He said : » Lord , I am innocent ! Would you destroy my people and me ?
» Abraham said that she was his sister . She said the same thing . I did this with a clear conscience . I have done no wrong ! «
God said to him in a dream : » Yes , I know that you did this with a clear conscience . In fact , I kept you from sinning against me . That is why I did not let you touch her .
» Give the man’s wife back to him now . He is a prophet . He will pray for you , and you will live . But if you do not give her back , you and all who belong to you are doomed to die . «
So Abimelech got up early in the morning . He called all his servants and told them everything . The men were very afraid .
Then Abimelech called Abraham . He said to him : » What have you done to us ? And how have I sinned against you ? You have brought a great sin on me and on my kingdom . You have done to me things that ought not to be done . «
Abimelech also asked Abraham : » What were you thinking when you did this ? «
Abraham said : » I thought that because there are no people who reverence God in this place , I would be killed because of my wife .
» Besides , she is my sister . She is my father’s daughter , but not my mother’s . She is also my wife .
» When God had me leave my father’s home and travel around , I said to her : ' Do me a favor : Wherever we go , say that I am your brother . ' "
Abimelech took sheep , cattle , and male and female slaves and gave them to Abraham . He also gave his wife Sarah back to him .
Abimelech said : » Look , here is my land . Live anywhere you like .
He said to Sarah : » Do not forget that I have given your brother twenty-five pounds of silver . This is to silence any criticism against you from everyone with you . You are completely cleared . «
Abraham prayed to God , and God healed Abimelech , his wife , and his female slaves so that they could have children .
Jehovah had made it impossible for any woman in Abimelech’s household to have children because of Abraham’s wife Sarah .
Jehovah was gracious to Sarah , as he had said . Jehovah did for Sarah what he had promised .
Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age . It was at the very time God had promised him .
Abraham gave the name Isaac he laughs to the son Sarah bore him .
When his son Isaac was eight days old , Abraham circumcised him as God had commanded him .
Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him .
Sarah said : » God brought me laughter . Everyone who hears about this will laugh on account of me . «
She added : » Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children ? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age . «
The child grew and was weaned . Abraham held a big feast on the day Isaac was weaned .
Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham was laughing in mockery .
She said to Abraham : » Get rid of that slave woman and her son . «
This upset Abraham because of his son Ishmael .
God said to Abraham : » Do not be upset about the boy and your slave . Listen to what Sarah says , because through Isaac your descendants will carry on your name .
» I will make the slave’s son into a nation also , because he is your child . «
Early the next morning Abraham took bread and a container of water and gave them to Hagar , putting them on her shoulder . He also gave her the boy and sent her on her way . So she left and wandered around in the desert near Beer-sheba .
When the water in the skin was used up , she left the boy under one of the bushes .
She sat across from him at a distance . She thought : » I cannot watch the boy die . " She sat opposite him , and lifted up her voice and wept .
God heard the lad crying . The angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her : » What is the matter with you , Hagar ? Do not fear ! God has heard the voice of the lad where he is .
» Arise , lift up the lad . Hold him by the hand . I will make him a great nation . «
Then God opened her eyes . She saw a well of water . She filled the skin with water and gave the lad a drink .
God was with the lad , and he grew . He lived in the wilderness and became an archer .
He lived in the wilderness of Paran . His mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt .
Abimelech and Phicol , the commander of his army , spoke to Abraham . They said : » God is with you in all that you do .
» Swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my offspring or with my posterity . Consider the kindness that I have shown to you . Please show it to me and to the land in which you have sojourned . «
Abraham said : » I swear it . «
Abraham complained to Abimelech because of the well of water that the servants of Abimelech had seized .
Abimelech said : » I do not know who has done this thing . You did not tell me , nor did I hear of it until today . «
Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech . The two of them made a covenant .
Then Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves .
Abimelech asked Abraham : » What do these seven ewe lambs mean , which you have set by themselves ? «
He said : » You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand so that it may be a witness to me , that I dug this well . «
Therefore he called that place Beer-sheba , because there the two of them took an oath .
They made a covenant at Beer-sheba . Abimelech and Phicol , the commander of his army , arose and returned to the land of the Philistines .
Abraham planted a tamarisk tree at Beer-sheba . There he called on the name of Jehovah , the Everlasting God .
Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines for many days .
God tested Abraham . He said to him : » Abraham ! « Abraham replied : » Here I am . «
» Take your son , your only son , whom you love , Isaac , and go to the land of Moriah . Offer him as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I will tell you . «
Early the next morning Abraham saddled his donkey . He took two of his servants and his son Isaac with him . He had cut the wood for the burnt offering . Then he set out for the place that God had told him about .
Two days later Abraham saw the place in the distance .
He said to the servants : » Stay here with the donkey . The boy and I will go over there and worship . Then we will come back to you . «
Abraham made Isaac carry the wood for the sacrifice . Abraham carried a knife and live coals for starting the fire . As they walked along together ,
Isaac spoke up : » Father ! « He answered : » Yes , my son ? « Isaac asked : » I see that you have the coals and the wood , but where is the lamb for the sacrifice ? «
Abraham answered : » God will provide one . « And the two of them walked on together .
They came to the place God had told him about . Abraham built an altar and arranged the wood on it . He tied up his son and placed him on the altar , on top of the wood .
Then he picked up the knife to kill him .
Jehovah’s angel shouted from heaven : » Abraham ! Abraham ! « » Here I am ! « he answered .
» Do not hurt the boy or harm him in any way ! « The angel said . » Now I know that you truly obey God , because you were willing to offer him your only son . «
Abraham looked up and saw a ram caught by its horns in the bushes . So he took the ram and sacrificed it in place of his son .
Abraham named that place » Jehovah Will Provide . « It is still said today : » It will be provided on the mountain of Jehovah . «
The angel of Jehovah called to Abraham from heaven a second time .
He said : » I am taking an oath on my own name , declares Jehovah , that because you have done this and have not refused to give me your son , your only son ,
‘ » I will certainly bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and the grains of sand on the seashore . Your descendants will take possession of their enemies’ cities .
‘ » All the nations will ask me to bless them as I have blessed your descendants . This is because you obeyed my command . ’ «
Abraham and Isaac went back to the servants who had come with him . They returned to Abraham’s home in Beer-sheba .
Abraham’s brother Nahor had married Milcah , and Abraham was later told that they had eight sons .
Uz was their firstborn . Buz was next . Then there was Kemuel who became the father of Aram . Their other five sons were
Chesed , Hazo , Pildash , Jidlaph , and Bethuel .
Bethuel became the father of Rebekah . These are the eight children Milcah bore to Nahor , Abraham’s brother .
His concubine , Reumah , also bore Tebah and Gaham and Tahash and Maacah .
Sarah lived one hundred and twenty-seven years . These were the years of the life of Sarah .
Sarah died in Kiriath-arba that is , Hebron in the land of Canaan . Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to cry because of her death .
Abraham left the side of his dead wife and spoke to the Hittites .
He said : » I am a stranger with no permanent home . Let me have some of your property for a tomb that I can bury my dead wife . «
The Hittites answered Abraham :
» Listen to us , my lord . You are a mighty leader among us . Bury your dead in one of our best tombs . Not one of us will withhold from you his tomb for burying your dead . «
Abraham got up and bowed to the people of that region , the Hittites .
He said : » If you are willing to let me bury my wife here , please ask Ephron son of Zohar
to sell me Machpelah Cave . It is near the edge of his field . Ask him to sell it to me for its full price here in your presence . Then I can own it as a burial ground . «
Ephron was sitting with the other Hittites at the meeting place at the city gate . He answered in the hearing of everyone there :
» Hear me my lord , I give you the field , including the cave . It is yours . With my own people as witnesses , I freely give it to you as a burial place for your dead . «
Once again , Abraham bowed down .
He spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land . He said : » If you will only please listen to me . I will give the price of the field . Accept it from me that I may bury my dead there . «
Ephron answered Abraham :
» My lord , listen to me . It is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver . What is that between you and me ? So bury your dead . «
Abraham listened to Ephron . Abraham weighed out for Ephron the silver that he had named in the hearing of the sons of Heth , four hundred shekels of silver , commercial standard .
Ephron’s field at Machpelah , east of Mamre , was sold to Abraham .
His property included the field with the cave in it as well as all the trees inside the boundaries of the field . The Hittites together with all who had entered the city gate were the official witnesses for the agreement .
Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave in the field of Machpelah , east of Mamre Hebron , in the land of Canaan .
The Hittites sold the field and its cave to Abraham as his property to be used as a tomb .
By now Abraham was old , and Jehovah had blessed him in every way .
Abraham said to the senior servant of his household who was in charge of all that he owned : » Take a solemn oath .
» I want you to swear by Jehovah God of heaven and earth that you will not get my son a wife from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I am living .
» Instead , you will go to the land of my relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac . «
The servant asked : » What if the young woman will not leave home to come with me to this land ? Shall I send your son back to the land you came from ? «
Abraham answered : » Make sure that you do not send my son back there !
» Jehovah , the God of heaven , took me from my father’s house and from the land of my birth . He spoke to me and swore to me . He said : I will give this land to your descendants . He will send his angel before you . You will take a wife for my son from there .
» You will be free from this oath if the woman is not willing to follow you . Only do not take my son back there . «
The servant placed his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master . He swore to him concerning this matter .
The servant took ten camels from the camels of his master , and then set out with a variety of good things of his master’s in his hand . He arose and went to Mesopotamia , to the city of Nahor .
He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at evening time . This is the time when women go out to draw water .
He said : » O Jehovah , the God of my master Abraham , please grant me success today . Show loving-kindness to my master Abraham .
» I am standing by the spring . The daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water .
» Let there be the girl to whom I say : ‘ Please let down your jar so that I may drink , ' and who answers : ' Drink , and I will water your camels also . ' May she be the one whom you have appointed for your servant Isaac . By this I will know that you have shown loving-kindness to my master . «
Before he finished praying , Rebekah came with her jar on her shoulder . She was the daughter of Bethuel , son of Milcah , who was the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor .
The girl was a very attractive virgin . No man had ever had sexual intercourse with her . She went to the spring and filled her jar , and came back .
The servant ran to meet her and said : » Please give me a drink of water . «
» Drink , my lord , « she said . She quickly lowered her jar to her hand and gave him a drink .
When she finished giving him a drink , she said : » I will also keep drawing water for your camels until they have had enough to drink . «
She quickly emptied her jar into the water trough . Then she ran back to the well to draw more water . She drew enough for all his camels .
The man quietly watched her to see whether or not Jehovah made his trip successful .
When the camels had finished drinking , the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a fifth of an ounce and two gold bracelets weighing four ounces .
He said : » Please tell me who your father is . Is there room in his house for my men and me to spend the night ? «
» My father is Bethuel son of Nahor and Milcah , « she answered .
» There is plenty of straw and fodder at our house . There is also a place for you to stay . «
The man knelt down and worshiped Jehovah .
He said : » Praise Jehovah , the God of my master Abraham . He has faithfully kept his promise to my master . Jehovah has led me straight to my master’s relatives . «
The young woman ran to her mother’s house and told the entire story .
Rebecca’s brother was named Laban . He ran outside to go to the well where Abraham’s servant was .
Laban had seen the nose ring and the bracelets on his sister’s arms and had heard her say what the man told her . He went to Abraham’s servant , who was standing by his camels at the well ,
and said : » Come home with me . You are a man Jehovah has blessed . Why are you standing out here ? I have a room ready for you in my house . There is a place for your camels . «
The man went into the house . Laban unloaded the camels and gave them straw and fodder . Then he brought water for Abraham’s servant and his men to wash their feet .
Food was brought . The man said : » I will not eat until I have said what I have to say . « Laban responded : » Go ahead and speak . «
» I am the servant of Abraham , « he began .
» Jehovah has greatly blessed my master and made him a rich man . He has given him flocks of sheep and goats , cattle , silver , gold , male and female slaves , camels , and donkeys .
» Sarah , my master’s wife , did not have any children until she was very old . Then she had a son , and my master has given him everything .
» I solemnly promised my master I would do what he said . He told me : ‘ Do not choose a wife for my son from the women in this land of Canaan .
» ‘ Go back to the land where I was born and find a wife for my son from among my relatives . ’
» I asked my master : ‘ What if the young woman refuses to come with me ? ’
» He said to me : ‘ Jehovah , before whom I have walked , will send his angel with you to make your journey successful . You will take a wife for my son from my relatives and from my father’s house .
» ‘ If my relatives do not give her to you , then you will be free from my oath . ’ «
» I came to the spring today . I prayed to Jehovah : ‘ God of my master Abraham , if now you will make my journey successful ,
» ‘ make it be that the maiden who comes out to draw , and to whom I say , » Please let me drink a little water from your jar , «
» And she will say to me , » You drink , and I will draw for your camels also , « let her be the woman whom Jehovah has appointed for my master’s son . ’
» Before I had finished speaking in my heart , Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder . She went down to the spring and drew , and I said to her , ‘ Please let me drink . ’
» She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder , and said , ‘ Drink , and I will water your camels also ’ ; so I drank , and she watered the camels also .
» Then I asked her : ‘ Whose daughter are you ? ’ ’ She said : ‘ The daughter of Bethuel , Nahor’s son , whom Milcah bore to him . ’ ’ I put the ring on her nose , and the bracelets on her wrists .
» I bowed low and worshiped Jehovah , and praised Jehovah , the God of my master Abraham . He guided me in the right way to take the daughter of my master’s kinsman for his son .
» If you are going to deal kindly and truly with my master , tell me . If not , let me know , that I may turn to the right hand or the left . «
Laban and Bethuel replied : » The matter comes from Jehovah . We cannot speak to you bad or good .
» Here is Rebekah before you ; take her and go . Let her be the wife of your master’s son , as Jehovah has spoken . «
Abraham’s servant heard their answer . Then he bowed down to Jehovah .
The servant took out gold and silver jewelry and clothes and gave them to Rebekah . He also gave expensive presents to her brother and mother .
He and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night . When they got up in the morning , he said : » Let me go back to my master . «
Her brother and mother replied : » Let the girl stay with us ten days or so . After that she may go . «
He said : » Do not make us stay . Jehovah has made my journey a success . Let me go back to my master . «
They answered : » Let us call her and find out what she has to say . «
They called Rebecca and asked : » Do you want to go with this man ? « » Yes , « she answered .
They allowed Rebecca and her old family servant to go with Abraham’s servant and his men . «
They gave Rebecca their blessing in these words : » May you , sister , become the mother of millions ! May your descendants conquer the cities of their enemies ! «
Rebecca and her young women got ready . They mounted the camels to go with Abraham’s servant , and they all started out .
Isaac had come into the wilderness of » The Well of the Living One Who Sees Me . « He was staying in the southern part of Canaan .
He went out in the early evening to take a walk in the fields . He saw camels coming .
Rebecca saw Isaac and she got down from her camel
She asked Abraham’s servant : » Who is that man walking toward us in the field ? « » He is my master , « the servant answered . So she took her veil scarf and covered her face .
The servant told Isaac everything he had done .
Isaac brought Rebecca into the tent that his mother Sarah had lived in . She became his wife . Isaac loved Rebecca . He was comforted for the loss of his mother .
Abraham married another woman . Her name was Keturah .
She bore him Zimran , Jokshan , Medan , Midian , Ishbak , and Shuah .
Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan , and the descendants of Dedan were the Asshurim , the Letushim , and the Leummim .
The sons of Midian were Ephah , Epher , Hanoch , Abida , and Eldaah . All these were Keturah’s descendants .
Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac .
While Abraham was still alive , he gave gifts to the sons of Hagar and Keturah . He also sent their sons to live in the east far from his son Isaac .
Abraham lived one hundred and seventy-five years .
Then he took his last breath and died at a very old age . After a long and full life , he joined his ancestors in death .
His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah , in the field of Ephron , the son of Zohar the Hittite , which is before Mamre .
This was the field Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth . Abraham and Sarah his wife were buried there .
After the death of Abraham , God blessed his son Isaac . Isaac lived by Beer-lahai-roi . The Well of the Living One , My Beholder .
This is the genealogy of Ishmael , Abraham’s son , whom Hagar the Egyptian , Sarah’s maid , bore to Abraham .
These are the names of the sons of Ishmael , by their names , in the order of their birth : Nebaioth , the firstborn of Ishmael , and Kedar and Adbeel and Mibsam
and Mishma and Dumah and Massa ,
Hadad and Tema , Jetur , Naphish and Kedemah .
These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names , by their villages , and by their camps : twelve leaders according to their tribes .
Ishmael lived one hundred and thirty-seven years . Then he died and was gathered to his ancestors .
His descendants lived as nomads from the region of Havilah to Shur . This is near Egypt , in the direction of Assyria . He died in the presence of all his brothers .
This is the genealogy of Abraham’s son Isaac and his descendants . Abraham was the father of Isaac .
Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah , daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram , and sister of Laban the Aramean .
Isaac prayed to Jehovah for his wife because she was childless . Jehovah answered his prayer . His wife Rebekah became pregnant .
She was going to have twins . Before they were born they struggled against each other in her womb . She said : » Why should something like this happen to me ? « She asked Jehovah for an answer .
Jehovah said : » Two nations are within you . You will give birth to two rival peoples . One will be stronger than the other . The older will serve the younger . «
The time came for her to give birth . She gave birth to twin sons .
The first one was reddish . His skin was like a hairy robe , so he was named Esau .
The second one was born holding on tightly to the heel of Esau . He was named Jacob . Isaac was sixty years old when they were born .
The boys grew up . Esau became a skilled hunter , a man who loved the outdoors . Jacob was an upright man who stayed at home .
Isaac preferred Esau . This is because he enjoyed eating the animals Esau killed . Rebecca preferred Jacob .
One day while Jacob was cooking some stew , Esau came in from hunting . He was hungry .
He said to Jacob : » I am starving ! Give me some of that red stuff . « That is why he was named Edom .
Jacob answered : » I will give it to you if you give me your birthright as the firstborn son . «
Esau said : » All right ! I am about to die . What good are rights as firstborn to me ? «
Jacob answered : » First make a vow that you will give me your birthright . « Esau made the vow and gave his rights as firstborn to Jacob .
Jacob gave him some bread and some of the soup . He ate and drank and then got up and left . Esau did not care about his birthright .
There was another famine in the land besides the earlier one during the time of Abraham . Isaac went to Abimelech , king of the Philistines , at Gerar .
Jehovah appeared to Isaac and said : » Isaac , stay away from Egypt ! I will show you where I want you to go .
» You will live there as a foreigner . I will be with you and bless you . I will keep my promise to your father Abraham by giving this land to you and your descendants .
» I will give you as many descendants as there are stars in the sky . I will give your descendants all of this land . They will be a blessing to every nation on earth .
» This is because Abraham did everything I told him to do . «
Isaac moved to Gerar .
His wife Rebekah was very beautiful . He was afraid that someone might kill him to get her . So he told everyone that Rebekah was his sister .
After Isaac had been there a long time , King Abimelech looked out a window and saw Isaac intimately laughing and caressing Rebekah .
Abimelech called him in and said : » Rebekah must be your wife ! Why did you say she is your sister ? « » I thought someone would kill me , « Isaac answered .
» Do you know what you have done ? « Abimelech shouted . » If someone had slept with her , you would have made our whole nation guilty ! «
So Abimelech charged all the people , saying : » He who touches this man or his wife will certainly be put to death . «
Isaac sowed in that land and reaped in the same year a hundredfold . Jehovah blessed him .
He became rich , and continued to grow richer until he became very wealthy .
He possessed flocks and herds and a great household . The Philistines envied him .
The Philistines stopped up all the wells that his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father . They filled them with dirt .
Abimelech said to Isaac : » Go away from us . You are too powerful for us . «
Isaac departed from there and camped in the valley of Gerar where he settled .
Then Isaac dug the water wells that had been dug in the days of his father Abraham . The Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Abraham . He gave them the same names his father had given them .
Isaac’s servants dug in the valley wadi torrent-valley and found a well of running water .
The herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with the herdsmen of Isaac . They said : » The water is ours ! « So he named the well Esek , because they argued with him .
They dug another well . And they quarreled over that one too . So Isaac named it Sitnah Accusation .
He moved on from there and dug another well . They did not quarrel over this one . So he named it Rehoboth Roomy . He said : » Now Jehovah has made room for us . We will prosper in this land . «
He went from there to Beer-sheba .
That night Jehovah appeared to Isaac . Jehovah said : » I am the God of your father Abraham . Do not be afraid , because I am with you . I will bless you and increase the number of your descendants for my servant Abraham’s sake . «
Isaac built an altar there and worshiped Jehovah . Then he set up his camp . His servants dug another well .
Abimelech came from Gerar with Ahuzzath , his friend companion , and Phicol , the commander of his army , to see Isaac .
Isaac asked : » Why have you now come to see me ? You were so unfriendly to me before and made me leave your country . «
They answered : » Now we know that Jehovah is with you . We think that there should be a solemn agreement between us . We want you to promise
» that you will not harm us . We did not harm you . We were kind to you and let you go peacefully . Now it is clear that Jehovah has blessed you . «
Isaac prepared a feast for them , and they ate and drank .
Early the next morning each man made his promise and sealed it with a vow . Isaac said good-bye to them . They parted as friends .
That day Isaac’s servants told him about the well they dug . They said : » We have found water . «
Isaac named the well Shibah . The town is still called Beer-sheba .
When Esau was forty he married Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite .
These two women brought a lot of grief to his parents , Isaac and Rebekah .
Isaac was old and going blind . He called his older son Esau and said to him : » Son ! « Esau answered : » Here I am . «
Isaac said : » I am old . I do not know when I will die .
» Please take your hunting equipment , your quiver and bow , and go out into the open country and hunt some wild game for me .
» Prepare a good-tasting meal for me . Prepare it the way I like it . Bring it to me to eat so that I will bless you before I die . «
Rebekah listened while Isaac was speaking to his son Esau . Esau went into the open country to hunt for some wild game to bring back .
Rebekah said to her son Jacob : » I have just heard your father speak to your brother Esau .
» He said : ‘ Bring me some wild game , and prepare a good-tasting meal for me to eat . Then I will bless you in the presence of Jehovah before I die . ’
» Now listen to me , Son , and do what I tell you .
» Go to the flock and pick out two fat young goats . I will cook them and make some of that food your father likes so much .
» You take it to him to eat . Then he will give you his blessing before he dies . «
Jacob said to his mother : » You know that Esau is a hairy man . I have smooth skin .
» Perhaps my father will touch me and find out that I am deceiving him . That way , I will bring a curse on myself instead of a blessing . «
His mother replied : » Let any curse against you fall on me , my son . Just do as I say , and go and get the goats for me . «
So Jacob brought the meat to his mother . And she cooked the tasty food that his father liked .
Then she took Esau’s best clothes and dressed Jacob in them .
She also covered the smooth part of his hands and neck with goatskins .
She gave her son Jacob the good-tasting meal and the bread she had prepared .
He went to his father and said : » Father ? « » Yes , « he answered . » Who are you , Son ? «
Jacob answered : » I am your older son Esau . I have done as you told me . Please sit up and eat some of the meat that I brought you . Then you can give me your blessing . «
Isaac said : » How did you find it so quickly , son ? « Jacob answered : » Jehovah your God helped me find it . «
Isaac said to Jacob : » Please come closer . Let me touch you . Are you really Esau ? «
Jacob went closer . His father touched him . He said : » You sound like Jacob , but your hands feel hairy like Esau’s . «
So Isaac blessed Jacob , thinking he was Esau .
Isaac asked : » Are you really my son Esau ? « » Yes , I am , « Jacob answered .
So Isaac told him : » Serve me the wild meat . I can give you my blessing . « Jacob gave him some meat , and he ate it . He also gave him some wine , and he drank it .
Then his father Isaac said to him : » Come close , my son , and kiss me . «
He came close and kissed him . He smelled the smell of his garments . Then he blessed him and said : » See , the smell of my son is like the smell of a field Jehovah has blessed . «
» May God give you of the dew of heaven , the fatness of the earth , and an abundance of grain and new wine .
» May peoples serve you . And nations bow down to you . Be master of your brothers . And may your mother’s sons bow down to you . Cursed be those who curse you . Blessed be those who bless you . «
No sooner had Isaac finished blessing Jacob , and Jacob left his presence , that Esau his brother came in from his hunting .
He also prepared a good-tasting meal and brought it to his father . Then he said to his father : » Please , Father , eat some of the meat I have hunted for you so that you will bless me . «
» Who are you ? « his father Isaac asked him . » I am your firstborn son , Esau , « he answered .
Isaac began to tremble and shake all over . He asked : » Who was it , then , who killed an animal and brought it to me ? I ate it just before you came . I gave him my final blessing , and so it is his forever . «
When Esau heard this he cried out loudly and bitterly . He said : » Give me your blessing also , Father ! «
Isaac responded : » Your brother deceived me . He has taken your blessing . «
Esau said : » This is the second time that he has cheated me . No wonder his name is Jacob . He took my rights as the firstborn son . Now he has taken my blessing . Have you saved a blessing for me ? «
Isaac answered : » I have already made him master over you . I have made all his relatives his slaves . I have given him grain and wine . Now there is nothing that I can do for you , son ! «
Esau pleaded : » Father , please ! Do you have only one blessing , Father ? Bless me too , Father ! « Esau broke down and wept .
Then Isaac said to him : » You will live off the land and what it yields .
» You will live by your sword . You will serve your brother . Soon you will become restless and break his yoke from your neck . «
So Esau bore a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him . Esau said to himself : » The days of mourning for my father are near . Then I will kill my brother Jacob . «
When Rebekah heard about Esau’s plans to kill Jacob , she called her younger son , Jacob . She said : » Your brother Esau is comforting himself by planning to kill you .
» Go quickly , my son . Run away to my brother Laban in Haran .
» Stay with him until your brother’s anger cools down .
» When your brother’s anger is gone and he has forgotten what you did to him , I will let you know . Then you may come back . Why should I lose both of you in one day ? «
Rebekah said to Isaac : » I cannot stand Hittite women ! I would rather die than see Jacob marry one of them . «
Isaac called Jacob , blessed him , and told him : » Do not marry a Canaanite .
» Go to Mesopotamia instead , to the home of your grandfather Bethuel . Marry one of the young women there , one of your uncle Laban’s daughters .
» Almighty God will bless your marriage and give you many children . You will become the father of many nations !
» He will bless you and your descendants as he blessed Abraham . You may take possession of this land , in which you have lived and which God gave to Abraham ! «
Isaac then sent Jacob to stay with Rebekah’s brother Laban , the son of Bethuel the Aramean .
Esau found out that his father Isaac had blessed Jacob and had warned him not to marry any of the Canaanite women . He also learned that Jacob had been sent to find a wife in northern Syria .
Jacob did as his father and mother said . He went to Paddan-aram .
It was clear to Esau that his father despised the local Canaanite women .
So Esau went to Ishmael and took Mahalath , the daughter of Abraham’s son Ishmael , the sister of Nebaioth , to be his wife in addition to the wives he had .
Jacob left Beer-sheba and traveled toward Haran .
As soon as the sun went down he stopped for the night . He took one of the stones from that place , put it under his head , and lay down there .
He had a dream in which he saw a stairway set up on the earth with its top reaching up to heaven . He saw the angels of God going up and coming down on it .
Jehovah was standing above the stairway . He proclaimed : » I am Jehovah , the God of your grandfather Abraham and the God of Isaac . I will give the land on which you are lying to you and your descendants .
» Your descendants will be like the dust on the earth . You will spread out to the west and to the east , to the north and to the south . Every family on earth will be blessed through you and through your descendants .
» Remember , I am with you . I will watch over you wherever you go . I will also bring you back to this land . I will not leave you until I do what I have promised you . «
Jacob woke up from his sleep and said : » Truly , Jehovah is in this place , and I did not know it ! «
He was filled with reverence . He said : » This is an awesome place ! Certainly , this is the house of God and the gateway to the heavens ! «
Early the next morning Jacob took the stone he had under his head . He set it up as a marker and poured oil on top of it .
He named that place Bethel House of God . Previously , the name of the city was Luz .
Jacob made a vow . He said : » If God will be with me and will watch over me on my trip and give me food to eat and clothes to wear ,
» and if I return safely to my father’s home , then Jehovah will be my God .
» This stone I placed as a marker will be the house of God . I will certainly give you a tenth of everything you give me . «
Jacob continued on his trip and arrived at the land in the east .
Suddenly he came upon a well out in the fields . There were three flocks of sheep lying around it . The flocks were watered from this well . It had a large stone over the opening .
When all the flocks came together there , the shepherds would roll the stone back and water them . Then they would put the stone back in place .
Jacob asked the shepherds : » Where are you from ? « They answered : » We are from Haran . «
Then he asked : » Do you know Nahor’s grandson Laban ? « » Yes , we do , « they replied .
Jacob asked : » How is he ? « They replied : » He is well . Here is Rachel his daughter coming with the sheep . «
» It is still the heat of the day . It is not time for livestock to be gathered . Would you like to water the sheep so they can get back to grazing ? «
They said : » We cannot , until all the flocks are gathered , and they roll the stone from the mouth of the well . Then we water the sheep . «
While he was still speaking with them , Rachel came with her father’s sheep , for she was a shepherdess .
Jacob saw Rachel , daughter of his uncle Laban , with his uncle Laban’s sheep . He came forward and rolled the stone off the opening of the well and watered his uncle Laban’s sheep .
Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept loudly .
Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s nephew and that he was Rebekah’s son . She ran and told her father .
As soon as Laban heard the news about his sister’s son Jacob , he ran to meet him . He embraced and kissed him and brought him into his home . Then Jacob told Laban all that had happened .
Laban said : » You are indeed my own flesh and blood . « Jacob stayed there a whole month .
Laban said to Jacob : » You should not work for me for nothing just because you are my relative . How much pay do you want ? «
Laban had two daughters . The older was named Leah and the younger Rachel .
Leah had soft eyes and Rachel was shapely and very beautiful .
Jacob was in love with Rachel , so he said : » I will work seven years for you , if you will let me marry Rachel . «
Laban answered : » It is better that I give her to you than to anyone else . Stay here with me . «
Jacob worked seven years for Laban . The time seemed like only a few days , because he loved Rachel so much .
Jacob said to Laban : » Give me my wife for the time is completed . I want to marry Rachel now ! «
Laban gathered all the men of the place and gave a feast .
In the evening when it was dark , he took Leah , his daughter , and gave her to him . Jacob slept with her .
Laban gave Zilpah , his servant-girl , to Leah , to be her maid .
» What have you done to me ? « Jacob asked Laban : » Did I work for you in return for Rachel ? Why did you cheat me ? «
Laban answered : » It is not our custom to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older one .
» Finish the week of wedding festivities with this daughter . Then we will give you the other one too . But you will have to work for me another seven years . «
Jacob did that . He finished the week with Leah . Then Laban gave his daughter Rachel to him as his wife .
Laban gave his slave Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her slave .
Jacob slept with Rachel too . He loved Rachel more than Leah . So he worked for Laban another seven years .
Jehovah saw that Leah was loved less , so he made it possible for her to have children . But Rachel had none .
Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son . She named him Reuben , because she said : » Certainly , Jehovah has seen my misery . Now my husband will love me ! «
She became pregnant again and gave birth to another son . She said : » Certainly , Jehovah has heard that I am unloved . He has also given me this son . « She named him Simeon .
She became pregnant again and gave birth to another son . She said : » Now at last my husband will become attached to me because I have given him three sons . « She named him Levi .
Leah became pregnant again and gave birth to another son . She said : » This time I will praise Jehovah . « So she named him Judah Praise . Then she stopped having children .
Rachel had not borne Jacob any children . As a result , she became jealous of her sister and said to Jacob : » Give me children , or I will die . «
Jacob became angry with Rachel . He said : » I cannot take the place of God . He is the one who keeps you from having children . «
She said : » Here is my maid Bilhah . Sleep with her , so that she can have a child for me . This way I can become a mother through her . «
Then Rachel let Jacob marry Bilhah . Jacob slept with Bilhah .
They had a son .
Rachel named him Dan , because she said : » God has answered my prayers . He has vindicated me and given me a son . «
Bilhah and Jacob had a second son .
Rachel said : » I have struggled hard with my sister , and I have won ! « So she named the boy Naphtali .
When Leah realized she could not have any more children , she let Jacob marry her servant Zilpah .
They had a son .
Leah said : » How fortunate . She called him Gad . «
Leah’s slave Zilpah gave birth to her second son for Jacob .
Leah said : » I am happy , for women will call me blessed . So she named him Asher . «
During the wheat harvest Reuben went out into the fields . He found some mandrake plants . He brought them to his mother Leah . Rachel said to Leah : » Please , give me some of your son’s mandrake plants . «
Leah replied : » Is it not enough that you took my husband ? Are you also going to take my son’s mandrake plants ? « Rachel responded : » Very well , Jacob can go to bed with you tonight in return for your son’s mandrake plants . «
Jacob came in from the fields that evening . Leah went out to meet him . » You are to sleep with me , « she said . » You are my reward for my son’s mandrake plants . « So he went to bed with her that night .
God answered Leah’s prayer . She became pregnant and gave birth to her fifth son for Jacob .
Leah said : » God has given me my reward , because I gave my slave to my husband . « So she named him Issachar .
She became pregnant again and gave birth to her sixth son for Jacob .
Leah said : » God has presented me with a wonderful gift . This time my husband will honor me , because I have given him six sons . « So she named him Zebulun .
Later she bore a daughter and named her Dinah .
Then God remembered Rachel . God listened to her and opened her womb .
So she conceived and gave birth to a son . She said : » God has taken away my reproach . «
She named him Joseph . She said : » May Jehovah give me another son . «
When Rachel gave birth to Joseph , Jacob said to Laban : » Send me away , that I may go to my own place and to my own country .
» Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you . Let me depart . For you know how much service I have done for you . «
But Laban said : » If now it pleases you , stay with me . I have observed that Jehovah has blessed me on your account . «
He continued : » Name your wages , and I will pay . «
Jacob responded : » You know how much work I have done for you and what has happened to your livestock under my care .
» The little that you had before I came has grown to a large amount . Jehovah has blessed you wherever I have been . When may I do something for my own family ? «
Laban asked : » What should I give you ? « Jacob answered : » Do not give me anything . Instead , do something for me . Then I will go back to taking care of and watching your flocks again .
» Let me go through all of your flocks today and take every speckled and spotted sheep , every black lamb , and every spotted and speckled goat . They will be my wages .
» My honesty will speak for itself whenever you come to check on my wages . Any goat I have that is not speckled or spotted or any lamb that is not black will be considered stolen . «
Laban answered : » I agree ; we will do as you have said . «
Laban took out the striped and spotted male goats , all the speckled and spotted female goats every one with white on it , and every black lamb . He had his sons take charge of them that same day .
They moved away from Jacob with this flock as far as he could travel in three days . Jacob took care of the rest of Laban’s flocks .
Jacob took green branches of poplar storax , almond , and plane trees and stripped off some of the bark so that the branches had white stripes on them .
He placed these branches in front of the flocks at their drinking troughs . He put them there , because the animals mated when they came to drink .
So when the goats bred in front of the branches , they produced young that were streaked , speckled , and spotted .
Jacob kept the sheep separate from the goats and made them face in the direction of the streaked and black animals of Laban’s flock . In this way he built up his own flock and kept it apart from Laban’s .
When the strongest of the flock were mating , Jacob would place the rods in the sight of the flock in the gutters , so that they might mate by the rods .
When the flock was feeble , he did not put them in . That way the feebler were Laban’s and the stronger Jacob’s .
He became exceedingly prosperous , and had large flocks and female and male servants and camels and donkeys .
Jacob heard that Laban’s sons were saying : » Jacob has taken everything that belonged to our father . He has gained all his wealth from him . «
He also noticed that Laban did not appear as friendly to him as before .
Jehovah said to Jacob : » Go back to the land of your ancestors and to your relatives . I will be with you . «
Then Jacob sent a message to Rachel and Leah to come out to the open country where his flocks were .
He said to them : » I have seen that your father’s attitude toward me is not as friendly as before . The God of my father has been with me .
» You both know that I have worked for your father with all my strength .
» Yet he has cheated me . He changed my wages ten times . However , God did not let him harm me . «
» When Laban said , ‘ The speckled goats shall be your wages , ’ ’ all the flocks produced speckled young . When he said , ‘ The striped goats shall be your wages , ’ ’ all the flocks produced striped young .
» This way God has taken sheep and goats from your father and given them to me .
» Once , when the flocks were mating , I dreamed that all the rams were either spotted or speckled .
» Then the angel of God said to me in the dream , ‘ Jacob . ’ ’ I said , here I am .
» He said , ‘ Look up and see , now please , that all the male goats that are mating are striped , speckled , or spotted , because I have seen everything that Laban is doing to you .
» ‘ I am the God of Bethel . That is where you anointed a pillar and made a vow to me . Arise and leave this land . Return to the land of your birth . ’ «
Rachel and Leah asked : » Do we still have any portion or inheritance in our father’s house ?
» Are we not accounted as foreigners by him ? He sold us and also utterly consumed the price paid for us .
» For all the riches that God took away from our father belong to us and to our children . Do what God told you to do . «
Then Jacob put his children and his wives on camels .
He drove all his livestock ahead of him . He took all the possessions that he had accumulated . He took his own livestock that he had accumulated in Paddan-aram and went back to his father Isaac in Canaan .
When Laban went to shear his sheep , Rachel stole her father’s household idols .
Jacob also tricked Laban the Aramean by not telling him he was leaving .
He left in a hurry with all that belonged to him . He crossed the Euphrates River and went toward the mountains of Gilead .
Three days after he left , Laban was told that Jacob had fled .
Laban took his men with him and pursued Jacob for seven days until he caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead .
In a dream that night God came to Laban . God said : » Be careful not to threaten Jacob in any way . «
Jacob camped on a mountain . So when Laban caught up with Jacob as he was camped in the hill country of Gilead , he set up his camp not far from Jacod’s .
Laban said to Jacob : » Why did you deceive me and carry off my daughters like women captured in war ?
» Why did you deceive me and slip away without telling me ? If you had told me , I would have sent you on your way with rejoicing and singing to the music of tambourines and harps .
» You did not even let me give a kiss to my sons and my daughters . This was a foolish thing you did .
» It is in my power to do you harm . But the God of your father came to me this night . He said , ‘ Take care that you say nothing good or bad to Jacob . ’
» It appears that you are going because your heart’s desire is for your father’s house . But why have you taken my gods ? «
Jacob answered Laban : » I was afraid you might take your daughters from me by force .
» As for your gods , if anyone of us has them , let him be put to death . Make a search in front of us all for what is yours , and take it . « Jacob had no knowledge that Rachel had taken them .
So Laban went into Jacob’s tent and into Leah’s tent , and into the tents of the two servant-women , but they were not there . He left Leah’s tent and went into Rachel’s .
Rachel took the images . She put them in the camels’ basket and was seated on them . Laban searched through the tent and did not find them .
Rachel said to her father : » Do not be angry , Father , but I cannot get up to greet you . I am having my period . « So even though Laban had made a thorough search , he did not find the idols .
Jacob lost his temper . » What crime have I committed ? « he asked angrily . » What law have I broken that gives you the right to hunt me down ?
» Now that you have searched through all my belongings , what household article have you found that belongs to you ? Put it out here where your men and mine can see it . Let them decide which one of us is right .
» I have been with you now for twenty years . Your sheep and your goats have not failed to reproduce . I have not even eaten any rams from your flocks .
» I always absorbed the loss when wild animals killed a sheep . I did not take it to you to show that it was not my fault . You demanded that I make good anything that was stolen during the day or during the night .
» Many times I suffered from the heat during the day and from the cold at night . I was not able to sleep .
» I have been in your house twenty years ! I was your servant for fourteen years because of your daughters . I kept your flock for six years . You changed my wages ten times .
» If the God of my father , the God of Abraham , out of respect for Isaac , had not been with me , you would have sent me away empty-handed by now . God has seen my misery and hard work . Last night he made it right ! «
Then Laban answered Jacob : » These are my daughters , my grandchildren , and my flocks . Everything you see is mine ! Yet , what can I do today for my daughters or for their children ?
» Now , let us make an agreement covenant and let it stand as a witness between you and me . «
Jacob took a stone and set it up as a marker .
Jacob said to his relatives : » Gather some stones . « They took stones , put them into a pile , and ate there by the pile of stones .
In his language , Laban called it » Jegar Sahadutha « Witness Pile , but Jacob called it » Galeed . «
Laban said : » This pile of stones stands as a witness between you and me today . « This is why it was named Galeed ,
and also Mizpah Watchtower , because he said : » May Jehovah watch between you and me when we are unable to see each other .
» If you mistreat my daughters or marry other women behind my back , remember that God stands as a witness between you and me . «
Laban also said to Jacob : » Here is the pile of stones . Here is the marker that I have set up between you and me .
» This pile of stones and this marker stand as witnesses that I will not go past the pile of stones to harm you , and that you will not go past the pile of stones or marker to harm me .
» May the God of Abraham and Nahor — the God of their father — judge between us . « So Jacob swore this oath out of respect for his father Isaac .
He offered a sacrifice on the mountain . He invited his relatives to eat the meal with him . They ate with him and spent the night on the mountain .
Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them . Then Laban left and went back home .
Along the way God’s angels met Jacob .
When he saw them , Jacob said : » This is God’s camp ! « He named that place Mahanaim .
Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in Seir , the country of Edom .
He informed them to say : » Your obedient servant , Jacob , reports to my master Esau that I have been staying with Laban and that I have delayed my return until now .
» I own cattle , donkeys , sheep , goats , and slaves . I am sending you word in the hope of gaining your favor . «
When the messengers returned to Jacob , they said : » We went to your brother Esau . He is already on his way to meet you . He has four hundred men with him . «
Jacob was frightened and worried . He divided the people who were with him into two groups . He also divided his sheep , goats , cattle , and camels .
He thought : » If Esau comes and attacks the first group , the other may be able to escape . «
Then Jacob prayed : » O God of my father Abraham , the God of my father Isaac , O Jehovah , you said to me : ‘ Go back to your country and your family and I will be good to you . ’
» I am less than nothing in comparison with all your love and your faithfulness to me your servant . I only had a stick in my hand when I traveled across Jordan . Now I have become two armies .
» Save me from the hand of Esau , my brother . I fear that he will attack me and kill both mothers and children .
» You said , ‘ I will make sure that you are prosperous and that your descendants will be as many as the grains of sand on the seashore . No one will be able to count them because there are so many . ’ «
Jacob stayed there that night . Then he prepared a gift for his brother Esau from what he had brought with him :
There were two hundred female goats and twenty male goats , two hundred female sheep and twenty male sheep ,
also thirty female camels with their young , forty cows and ten bulls , twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys .
He placed servants in charge of each herd . He said to his servants : » Go ahead of me , and maintain a distance between the herds . «
He commanded the first servant : » When my brother Esau meets you and asks you , ‘ To whom do you belong , and where are you going , and whose animals are these ahead of you ? ’
» Say , ‘ They belong to your servant Jacob . This is a gift sent to you . Jacob is directly behind us . ’ «
He also commanded the second servant , the third , and all the others who followed the herds . He said : » Say the same thing to Esau when you find him .
» Be sure to say , ‘ Jacob is right behind us . ’ « He thought : » I will make peace with him by giving him this gift that I am sending ahead of me . After that , I will see him , and he will welcome me back . «
Jacob sent the gift ahead of him , while he stayed in the camp that night .
That same night Jacob got up , took his two wives , his two concubines , and his eleven children , and crossed the ford of the Jabbok River .
After he sent them across , he also sent across all that he owned .
Then Jacob was by himself . A man was fighting with him till dawn .
The man saw that he was not able to overcome Jacob . He gave him a blow in the hollow part of his thigh , so that his leg was damaged .
He said to him : » Let me go now , for the dawn is near . « But Jacob said : » I will not let you go till you have given me your blessing . «
Then he asked : » What is your name ? « And he said , » Jacob . «
The man said : » Your name will no longer be Jacob , but Israel He Struggles With God , because you have struggled with God and with men — and you have won . «
Jacob said : » Please tell me your name . « The man answered : » Why do you ask for my name ? « Then he blessed Jacob there .
Jacob named that place Peniel Face of God , because he said : » I have seen God face to face , yet my life was saved . «
The sun rose as he passed Penuel . He was limping because of his thigh .
Therefore , even today the people of Israel do not eat the muscle of the thigh the sinew attached to the hip socket . This is because God touched the socket of Jacob’s thigh at the muscle .
Jacob saw Esau coming with his four hundred men . Therefore he divided the children among Leah , Rachel , and the two concubines .
He put the concubines and their children first , then Leah and her children , and finally Rachel and Joseph at the rear .
Jacob went ahead of them . He bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother .
Esau ran to meet him . He threw his arms around him , and kissed him . They both cried .
Esau looked around and saw the women and the children . He asked : » Who are these people with you ? « Jacob answered : » These are the children whom God has been good enough to give me . «
Then the concubines came up with their children and bowed down .
Leah and her children came next , and last of all Joseph and Rachel came and bowed down .
Esau asked : » What about that other group I met ? What do you mean by all this company ? « Jacob answered : » It was to gain your favor . «
» But , brother , I already have plenty , « Esau replied . » Keep them for yourself . «
Jacob said : » Please accept these gifts as a sign of your friendship for me . When you welcomed me and I saw your face , it was like seeing the face of God .
» Take my offering then , with my blessing . God has been very good to me and I have enough . « So at his strong request , he took it .
Esau said : » Let us go on our journey together . I will go in front . «
Jacob responded : » My lord knows that the children are frail and that the flocks and herds that are nursing are a care to me . If they are driven hard one day , all the flocks will die .
» Please let my lord pass on before his servant . I will proceed at my leisure , according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children , until I come to my lord at Seir . «
Esau said : » Please let me leave with you some of the people who are with me . « But he said : » What need is there ? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord . «
So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir .
Jacob moved on to Succoth . He built a house there for himself and made shelters for his livestock . That is why the place is named Succoth .
Jacob traveled safely from Paddan-aram to the city of Shechem in Canaan . He camped within sight of the city .
He bought the piece of land on which he pitched his tents . He bought it from the sons of Hamor , father of Shechem , for one hundred pieces of silver .
He set up an altar there and named it God , the God of Israel .
One day Dinah , the daughter of Jacob and Leah , went to visit some of the Canaanite women .
Shechem , son of Hamor the Hivite , who was chief of that region , saw her . He grabbed her and raped sexually defiled her .
He found the young woman so attractive that he fell in love with her . So he tried to win her affection .
He told his father : » I want you to get Dinah for me as my wife . «
Jacob learned that his daughter had been disgraced . Since his sons were out in the fields with his livestock , he did nothing until they came back .
Shechem’s father Hamor went out to talk with Jacob .
About that time Jacob’s sons were coming in from the fields . When they heard about it , they were shocked and furious that Shechem had done such a thing . He had insulted the people of Israel by raping Jacob’s daughter .
Hamor said to him : » My son Shechem has fallen in love with your daughter . Please let him marry her .
» Let us make an agreement that there will be intermarriage between our people and yours .
» Then you may stay here in our country with us . You may live anywhere you wish . You may trade freely and own property . «
Shechem added : » Let me have your favor and I will give you whatever you want .
» Ask anything as the bride price , no matter how expensive . I will do anything . Just let me marry Dinah . «
Jacob’s sons wanted to get even with Shechem and his father because of what happened to their sister .
So they tricked them by saying : » You are not circumcised ! It would be a disgrace for us to let you marry Dinah now .
» But we will let you marry her , if you and the other men in your tribe get circumcised .
» Then we will give our daughters to you . And we will take your daughters for us . We will live with you as one people .
» But if you will not undergo circumcision as we say , then we will take our daughter and go . «
Their words pleased Hamor and Hamor’s son Shechem .
The young man did not delay to do what was required . This was because he had delight in Jacob’s daughter . He was the most honored of all his family .
Hamor and his son Shechem went to their city gate to speak to the men of their city . They said :
» These people are friendly toward us . So let them live in our land and move about freely in the area . Look , there is plenty of room in this land for them . We can marry their daughters and let them marry ours .
» These people will consent to live with us and become one nation on one condition : Every male must be circumcised , as they are .
» Then all their livestock and everything else they own will be ours . So let us agree that they can live among us . «
All the citizens of the city agreed with what Hamor and Shechem proposed . Then all the males were circumcised .
Three days later the men who had been circumcised were still weak from pain . So Simeon and Levi , two of Dinah’s brothers , attacked with their swords and killed every man in town .
They also killed Hamor and Shechem . Then they took Dinah and left .
The sons of Jacob came upon the slain . They plundered the city , because their sister had been defiled .
They took their flocks and their herds , their asses and whatever was in the city and in the field .
They captured their wives and all their little ones . They took all the wealth that was in their houses .
Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi : » You have brought trouble on me by making me loathsome to the inhabitants of the land , the Canaanites and the Per ’ izzites . My numbers are few . If they gather themselves against me and attack my household I will be destroyed . «
They responded : » Should he treat our sister like a prostitute ? «
God said to Jacob : » Go to Bethel and dwell there . Make an altar to God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau . «
Jacob said to his family and those who were with him : » Get rid of the foreign gods that you have . Wash yourselves until you are ritually clean . Change your clothes .
» After that let us go to Bethel . I will make an altar there to God , who answered me when I was troubled and who has been with me wherever I have gone . «
So everyone gave Jacob their idols and their earrings . He buried them under the oak big tree near Shechem .
Jacob and his family traveled through Canaan . God terrified the people in the towns so much that no one dared bother them .
Finally , they reached Bethel , also known as Luz .
Jacob built an altar there and called it God of Bethel . That was the place where God appeared to him when he was running from Esau .
Deborah died . She was the servant who cared for Rebekah from childhood . She was buried near Bethel , under the holy tree . They named it Allon-bacuth weeping tree .
God appeared to Jacob again when he came from Paddan-aram . He blessed him .
God said to him : » Your name is Jacob . You shall no longer be called Jacob . Israel shall be your name . « Thus He called him Israel .
God also said : » I am God Almighty . Be fruitful and increase in number . A nation and an assembly of nations will come from you . Kings shall come forth from you .
» The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you . I will give the land to your descendants after you . «
Then God went up from him at the place where he had spoken with him .
So Jacob set up a memorial , a stone marker , to mark the place where God had spoken with him . He poured a wine offering and olive oil on it .
Jacob named the place where God had spoken with him Bethel House of God .
After that they moved from Bethel . When there was still some distance to go to Ephrath , Rachel went into labor . She had severe labor pains .
When one of her pains hit , the midwife said : » Do not be afraid . You have another son ! «
Rachel was dying ! With her last breath she named her son Ben-oni Son of My Sorrow , but his father named him Benjamin Son of My Right Hand .
Rachel died and was buried on the way to Bethlehem Ephrath .
Jacob set up a stone as a marker for her grave . The same marker is at Rachel’s grave today .
Israel moved on again . He pitched his tent by the tower of Eder .
While Israel lived in that region , Reuben went to bed with his father’s concubine Bilhah . Israel heard about it . Jacob had twelve sons .
The sons of Leah were Jacob’s firstborn Reuben , then Simeon , Levi , Judah , Issachar , and Zebulun .
The sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin .
The sons of Rachel’s slave Bilhah were Dan and Naphtali .
The sons of Leah’s slave Zilpah were Gad and Asher . These were Jacob’s sons , who were born in Paddan-aram .
Jacob came home to his father Isaac , to Mamre’s city , Kiriath-arba Hebron . Abraham and Isaac had lived there for a while .
Isaac was one hundred and eighty years old .
Isaac took his last breath and died . He joined his ancestors in death at a very old age . His sons Esau and Jacob buried him .
This is the genealogy of Esau , who is Edom , and his descendants .
Esau selected his wives from the daughters of Canaan : Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite ; Oholibamah the daughter of Anah , the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite ;
and Basemath , Ishmael’s daughter , sister of Nebaioth .
Now Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau , and Basemath bore Reuel .
And Oholibamah bore Jeush , Jaalam , and Korah . These were the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan .
Then Esau took his wives , his sons , his daughters , and all the persons of his household , his cattle and all his animals , and all his goods which he had gained in the land of Canaan , and went to a country away from the presence of his brother Jacob .
For their possessions were too great for them to dwell together , and the land where they were strangers could not support them because of their livestock .
So Esau dwelt in Mount Seir . Esau is Edom .
This is the genealogy of Esau the father of the Edomites in Mount Seir .
These were the names of Esau’s sons : Eliphaz the son of Adah , the wife of Esau , and Reuel the son of Basemath , the wife of Esau .
The sons of Eliphaz were Teman , Omar , Zepho , Gatam , and Kenaz .
Timna was the concubine of Eliphaz , Esau’s son , and she bore Amalek to Eliphaz . These were the sons of Adah , Esau’s wife .
These were the sons of Reuel : Nahath , Zerah , Shammah , and Mizzah . These were the sons of Basemath , Esau’s wife .
These were the sons of Oholibamah , Esau’s wife , the daughter of Anah , and the daughter of Zibeon . And she bore to Esau : Jeush , Jaalam , and Korah .
These were the sheiks chiefs of the sons of Esau . The sons of Eliphaz , the firstborn son of Esau , were Chief Teman , Chief Omar , Chief Zepho , Chief Kenaz ,
Chief Korah , Chief Gatam , and Chief Amalek . These were the chiefs of Eliphaz in the land of Edom . They were the sons of Adah .
These were the sons of Reuel , Esau’s son : Chief Nahath , Chief Zerah , Chief Shammah , and Chief Mizzah . These were the chiefs of Reuel in the land of Edom . These were the sons of Basemath , Esau’s wife .
These were the sons of Oholibamah , Esau’s wife : Chief Jeush , Chief Jaalam , and Chief Korah . These were the chiefs who descended from Oholibamah , Esau’s wife , the daughter of Anah .
These were the sons of Esau , who is Edom , and these were their chiefs .
These were the sons of Seir the Horite who inhabited the land : Lotan , Shobal , Zibeon , Anah ,
Dishon , Ezer , and Dishan . These were the sheiks chiefs of the Horites , the sons of Seir , in the land of Edom .
The sons of Lotan were Hori and Hemam . Lotan’s sister was Timna .
These were the sons of Shobal : Alvan , Manahath , Ebal , Shepho , and Onam .
These were the sons of Zibeon : both Aiah and Anah . This was the Anah who found the water in the wilderness as he pastured the donkeys of his father Zibeon .
These were the children of Anah : Dishon and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah .
These were the sons of Dishon : Hemdan , Eshban , Ithran , and Cheran .
These the sons of Ezer : Bilhan , Zaavan , and Akan .
These were the sons of Dishan : Uz and Aran .
These were the chiefs of the Horites : Chief Lotan , Chief Shobal , Chief Zibeon , Chief Anah ,
Chief Dishon , Chief Ezer , and Chief Dishan . These were the chiefs of the Horites , according to their chiefs in the land of Seir .
Now these were the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the children of Israel :
Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom , and the name of his city was Dinhabah .
And when Bela died , Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his place .
When Jobab died , Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his place .
And when Husham died , Hadad the son of Bedad , who attacked Midian in the field of Moab , reigned in his place . And the name of his city was Avith .
When Hadad died , Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his place .
And when Samlah died , Shaul of Rehoboth-by-the-River reigned in his place .
When Shaul died , Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his place .
And when Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died , Hadar reigned in his place ; and the name of his city was Pau . His wife’s name was Mehetabel , the daughter of Matred , the daughter of Mezahab .
These were the names of the sheiks chiefs of Esau , according to their families and their places , by their names : Chief Timnah , Chief Alvah , Chief Jetheth ,
Chief Oholibamah , Chief Elah , Chief Pinon ,
Chief Kenaz , Chief Teman , Chief Mibzar ,
Chief Magdiel , and Chief Iram . These were the sheiks of Edom , according to their dwelling places in the land of their possession . Esau was the father of the Edomites .
Jacob continued to live in the land of Canaan , where his father had lived .
This is the story of Jacob and his descendants . Joseph was a seventeen-year-old young man . He took care of the flocks with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah , his father’s wives . Joseph told his father about the bad things his brothers were doing .
Jacob Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons because Joseph had been born in Israel’s old age . So he made Joseph a special multicolored robe with long sleeves .
Joseph’s brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them . They hated Joseph and could not speak to him in a friendly way .
One time Joseph had a dream . He told his brothers about it and they hated him even more .
He said : » Please listen to the dream I had .
» We were all in the field tying up sheaves of wheat . My sheaf got up and stood up straight . Yours formed a circle around mine and bowed down to it . «
» Do you think you are going to be a king and rule over us ? « his brothers asked . So they hated him even more because of his dreams and because of what he said about them .
Joseph had another dream and told his brothers : » I had another dream , in which I saw the sun , the moon , and eleven stars bowing down to me . «
He also told the dream to his father . His father scolded him . » What kind of a dream is that ? Do you think that your mother , your brothers , and I are going to come and bow down to you ? «
Joseph’s brothers were jealous of him . His father kept thinking about the whole matter .
His brothers went to Shechem to take care of their father’s flock .
His father Jacob said to him : » I want you to go to your brothers . They are with the sheep near Shechem . « » Yes , I will go , « Joseph answered .
His father said : » Go and find out how your brothers and the sheep are doing . Then come back and let me know . « So he sent him from Hebron Valley . Joseph was near Shechem ,
and wandering through the fields , when a man asked : » What are you looking for ? «
Joseph answered : » I am looking for my brothers who are watching the sheep . Can you tell me where they are ? «
» They are not here anymore , « the man replied . » I heard them say they were going to Dothan . « Joseph soon found his brothers in Dothan .
Before he arrived , they saw him coming and made plans to kill him .
They said to one another : » Look , here comes the hero of those dreams !
» Let us kill him and throw him into a water pit . We can say that some wild animal ate him . Then we will see what happens to those dreams . «
Reuben heard this and tried to protect Joseph from them . » Let us not kill him , « he said .
» Do not murder him or even harm him . Just throw him into a dry well out here in the desert . « Reuben planned to rescue Joseph later and take him back to his father .
When Joseph came to his brothers , they pulled off his fancy coat .
They put him into a water pit . It had no water in it .
As they sat down to eat , they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead . Their camels were carrying the materials for cosmetics , medicine , and embalming . They were on their way to take them to Egypt .
Judah asked his brothers : » What will we gain by killing our brother and covering up his death ?
» Let us sell him to the Ishmaelites . Let us not hurt him , because he is our brother , our own flesh and blood . « His brothers agreed .
Some of the Midianite traders approached . The brothers pulled Joseph out of the well and sold him for twenty pieces of silver to the Ishmaelites . They took him to Egypt .
Reuben came back to the pit and found that Joseph was not there . He tore his clothes in sorrow .
He returned to his brothers and said : » The boy is not there ! What am I going to do ? «
Then they killed a goat and dipped Joseph’s robe in its blood .
They took the robe to their father and said : » We found this . Does it belong to your son ? «
He recognized it and said : » Yes , it is his ! Some wild animal has killed him . My son Joseph has been torn to pieces ! «
Jacob tore his clothes in sorrow and put on sackcloth . He mourned for his son a long time .
All his sons and daughters came to comfort him . However , he refused to be comforted . He said : » I will go down to the grave still mourning for my son . « So he continued to mourn for his son Joseph .
Meanwhile , in Egypt the Midianites sold Joseph to Potiphar , one of the king’s officers , who was the captain of the palace guard .
At that time Judah left his brothers and went to stay with a man named Hirah , who was from the town of Adullam .
Judah met a young Canaanite woman there whose father was named Shua . He married her .
Shua bore him a son , whom he named Er .
She became pregnant again and gave birth to another son and named him Onan .
She had another son and named him Shelah . Judah was at Achzib when the boy was born .
For his first son Er , Judah got a wife whose name was Tamar .
Er was an evil man . It displeased Jehovah . So Jehovah killed him .
Then Judah said to Er’s brother Onan : » Go sleep with your brother’s widow . Fulfill your obligation to her as her husband’s brother . That way your brother may have descendants . «
Onan knew that the children would not belong to him . So when he had intercourse with his brother’s widow , he let the semen spill on the ground , assuring that there would be no children for his brother .
What he did displeased Jehovah . So Jehovah killed him also .
Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar : » Return to your father’s house and remain a widow until my son Shelah grows up . « He said this because he was afraid that Shelah would be killed , as his brothers had been . So Tamar went back home .
After some time Judah’s wife died . When he finished mourning , he and his friend Hirah of Adullam went to Timnah , where his sheep were being sheared .
Tamar found out that her father-in-law Judah was going to Timnah to shear his sheep .
She realized that Shelah was now a grown man . She had not been allowed to marry him . So she decided to dress in something other than her widow’s clothes and to cover her face with a veil . Then she sat outside the town of Enaim on the road to Timnah .
Judah came along . He did not recognize her because of the veil . He thought she was a prostitute ,
and asked her to sleep with him . She asked : » What will you give me if I do ? «
He answered : » One of my young goats . « Then she asked : » What will you give me to keep until you send the goat ? «
» What do you want ? « he asked . » The ring on that cord around your neck , « she replied . » I also want the special walking stick you have with you . « So he gave them to her . They slept together and she became pregnant .
After returning home , Tamar took off the veil and dressed in her widow’s clothes again .
Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite , to receive the pledge from the woman’s hand . But he did not find her .
He asked the men : » Where is the temple prostitute who was by the road at Enaim ? « They said : » There has been no temple prostitute here . «
So he went back to Judah and said : » I did not find her . Besides , the men who lived there said there has not been any temple prostitute here . «
Then Judah said : » Let her keep what she has , or we will become a laughingstock . After all , I did send her this young goat , but you did not find her . «
Three months later Judah was told : » Your daughter-in-law Tamar is guilty of prostitution , and as a result she is now pregnant . « Judah said : » Bring her out and have her burned to death ! «
As she was being brought out , she sent a message to her father-in-law . » I am pregnant by the man who owns these , « she said . She added : » See if you recognize whose seal and cord and staff these are . «
Judah recognized them and said : » She is more righteous than I , since I would not give her to my son Shelah . « He did not sleep with her again .
When the time came for her to give birth , there were twin boys in her womb .
As she was giving birth , one of them put out his hand . The midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it on his wrist and said : » This one came out first . «
When he drew back his hand , his brother came out . She said : » So this is how you have broken out ! « He was named Perez .
Then his brother , who had the scarlet thread on his wrist , came out and he was given the name Zerah .
Joseph had been taken to Egypt . Potiphar , one of Pharaoh’s Egyptian officials and captain of the guard , bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there .
Jehovah was with Joseph . Joseph became a successful man . He worked in the house of his Egyptian master .
Joseph’s master saw that Jehovah was with him . Jehovah made him succeed in everything he did .
Potiphar was pleased with him and made him his personal servant . He put him in charge of his house and everything he owned .
Jehovah blessed the Egyptian’s household and everything he had in his house and in his fields because of Joseph .
Potiphar turned over everything he had to the care of Joseph . He did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate . Joseph was well built and good-looking .
Soon his master’s wife began to desire Joseph and asked him to go to bed with her .
He refused , and said to her : » My master does not have to concern himself with anything in the house , because I am here . He has put me in charge of everything he has .
» No one in this house is greater than I . He has kept nothing back from me except you . You are his wife . How could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God ? «
She kept asking Joseph day after day . He refused to go to bed with her or be with her .
One day he went into the house to do his work . None of the household servants were there .
She grabbed him by his coat and said : » Come to bed with me ! « But he ran outside and left his coat in her hand .
When she realized that he had gone but had left his coat behind ,
she called her household servants and said to them : » Look ! My husband brought this Hebrew here to fool around with us . He came in and tried to go to bed with me . I screamed as loud as I could .
» When he heard me scream , he ran out of the house , leaving his coat with me . «
Potiphar’s wife kept Joseph’s coat until her husband came home .
She said : » That Hebrew slave of yours tried to rape me !
» When I screamed for help , he left his coat and ran out of the house . «
Potiphar became very angry
and threw Joseph in the same prison where the king’s prisoners were kept . While Joseph was in prison ,
Jehovah helped him and was good to him . He even made the jailer like Joseph so much that
he put him in charge of the other prisoners and of everything that was done in the jail .
The jailer did not worry about anything , because Jehovah was with Joseph and made him successful in all that he did .
The king’s chief cupbearer and his chief baker made the king angry .
Pharaoh was furious with his two officials , the chief cupbearer and the chief baker .
So he put them in confinement in the house of the captain of the bodyguard . It was the same place where Joseph was imprisoned .
The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph . He took care of them . After they had been confined for some time ,
both prisoners , the cupbearer and the baker for the king of Egypt , had dreams one night . Each man had a dream with its own special meaning .
Joseph saw that they were upset when he came to them in the morning .
He asked these officials of Pharaoh who were with him in his master’s prison : » Why do you look so unhappy today ? «
» We both had dreams , « they answered him , » but there is no one to tell us what they mean . « » Is it not God who can tell what dreams mean ? « Joseph asked them . » Tell me all about them . «
So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream . He said : » In my dream a grapevine with three branches appeared in front of me .
» Soon after it sprouted it blossomed . Then its clusters ripened into grapes .
» Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand . I took the grapes and squeezed them into it . I put the cup in Pharaoh’s hand . «
» This is what it means , « Joseph said to him . » The three branches are three days .
» In the next three days Pharaoh will release you and restore you to your position . You will put Pharaoh’s cup in his hand as you used to do when you were his cupbearer .
» Remember me when things go well for you . Please do me a favor . Mention me to Pharaoh , and get me out of this prison .
» I was in fact kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews . And here I have done nothing that they should have put me into the dungeon . «
When the chief baker saw that he had interpreted favorably , he said to Joseph : » I also saw in my dream three baskets of white bread on my head .
» The top basket contained all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh . The birds were eating them out of the basket on my head . «
Joseph answered : » This is its interpretation : the three baskets are three days .
» In three more days Pharaoh will lift up your head from you . He will hang you on a tree , and the birds will eat your flesh off you . «
It happened on the third day , which was Pharaoh’s birthday that he made a feast for all his servants . He lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants .
He restored the chief cupbearer to his office , and he put the cup into Pharaoh’s hand .
He did indeed hang the chief baker , just as Joseph had interpreted to them .
Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph . In fact he forgot him .
Two years later Pharaoh had a dream . He dreamed he was standing by the Nile River .
Suddenly , seven nice-looking well-fed cows came up from the river and began to graze among the reeds .
Seven other cows came up from the river behind them . These cows were sickly and skinny . They stood behind the first seven cows on the riverbank .
The cows that were sickly and skinny ate the seven nice-looking well-fed cows . Then Pharaoh woke up .
He fell asleep again and had another dream . Seven heads of grain , full and ripe , were growing on one stalk .
Then seven other heads of grain sprouted thin and scorched by the desert wind .
The thin heads of grain swallowed the full ones . The king woke up and realized that he had been dreaming .
The king was upset the next morning . So he called his magicians and wise men and told them what he had dreamed . None of them could tell him what the dreams meant .
The king’s chief cupbearer said : » Now I remember what I was supposed to do .
» When you were angry with your chief cook and me , you threw us both in jail in the house of the captain of the guard .
» One night we both had dreams . Each dream had a different meaning .
» A young Hebrew , who was a servant of the captain of the guard , was there with us at the time . When we told him our dreams , he explained what each of them meant .
» Everything happened just as he said it would . I got my job back , and the cook was put to death . «
So the king sent for Joseph . He was quickly brought out of jail . He shaved , changed his clothes , and went to the king .
The king said : » I had a dream . No one can explain what it means . I am told that you can interpret dreams . «
Joseph then answered Pharaoh : » I cannot do it myself , but God can give the meaning of your dreams . «
The king told Joseph : » I dreamed as I stood on the bank of the Nile River ,
» I saw seven fat , healthy cows come up out of the river . They began feeding on the grass .
» Next , seven skinny , bony cows came up out of the river . I have never seen such terrible looking cows anywhere in Egypt .
» The skinny cows ate the fat ones !
» Even though they had eaten the fat cows , no one could tell they had eaten them . They looked just as sick as before . Then I woke up .
» In my second dream I saw seven good , full heads of grain growing on a single stalk .
» Seven other heads of grain , withered , thin , and scorched by the east wind , sprouted behind them .
» The thin heads of grain swallowed the seven good heads . I told this to the magicians , but no one could tell me what it meant . «
Joseph said to Pharaoh : » Pharaoh had the same dream twice . God has told Pharaoh what he is going to do .
» The seven good cows are seven years . The seven good heads of grain are seven years . It is all the same dream .
» The seven thin , sickly cows that came up behind them are seven years . The seven empty heads of grain scorched by the east wind are also seven years . Seven years of famine are coming !
» It is just as I said to Pharaoh . God has shown Pharaoh what he is going to do .
» Seven years are coming when there will be plenty of food in Egypt .
» Seven years of famine will follow . Then people will forget that there was plenty of food in Egypt . The famine will ruin the land .
» People will not remember that there was once plenty of food in the land , because the coming famine will be so severe .
» The reason Pharaoh has had a recurring dream is because the matter has been definitely decided by God . He will do it very soon .
» Pharaoh should look for a wise and intelligent man and put him in charge of Egypt .
» Make arrangements to appoint supervisors over the land . Take a fifth of Egypt’s harvest during the seven good years .
» Have them collect all the food during these good years . Store up grain under Pharaoh’s control , to be kept for food in the cities .
» This food will be a reserve supply for our country during the seven years of famine that will happen in Egypt . Then the land will not be ruined by the famine . «
The king and his officials approved this plan ,
and he said to them : » We will never find a better man than Joseph . He is a man who has God’s Spirit in him . «
The king said to Joseph : » God has shown you all this . Therefore it is obvious that you have greater wisdom and insight than anyone else .
» I will put you in charge of my country . All my people will obey your orders . Your authority will be second only to mine .
» I now appoint you governor over all Egypt . «
Pharaoh took his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph’s hand . He clothed him in garments of fine linen and put the gold necklace around his neck .
He had him ride in his second chariot . They proclaimed before him : » Bow the knee ! « Thus he set him over all the land of Egypt .
Moreover , Pharaoh said to Joseph : » Though I am Pharaoh , yet without your permission no one shall raise his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt . «
Pharaoh named Joseph , Zaphenath-paneah . He gave him Asenath , the daughter of Potiphera , priest of On , as his wife . And Joseph went forth over the land of Egypt .
Now Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh , king of Egypt . Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went through all the land of Egypt .
During the seven years of plenty the land produced abundantly .
He gathered all the food of these seven years that occurred in the land of Egypt and placed the food in the cities . He placed in every city the food from its own surrounding fields .
Thus Joseph stored up grain in great abundance , like the sand of the sea . He finally stopped measuring it , for it was beyond measure .
Before the year of famine came , there were born to Joseph two sons , whom Asenath , the daughter of Potiphera , priest of On , bore to him .
Joseph named his firstborn son Manasseh , because God helped him forget all his troubles and all about his father’s family .
He named the second son Ephraim , because God made him fruitful in the land where he had suffered .
The seven years when there was plenty of food in Egypt came to an end .
The seven years of famine began , just as Joseph had said . There was famine in every other country , but there was food throughout Egypt .
When the Egyptians became hungry , they cried out to the king for food . So he ordered them to go to Joseph and do what he told them .
The famine grew worse and spread over the entire country . Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians .
People came to Egypt from all over the world to buy grain from Joseph , because the famine was severe everywhere .
When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt , he said to his sons : » Why are you doing nothing ? «
He said : » I have heard that there is grain in Egypt . Go down there and buy some for us from that place , so that we may live and not die . «
Then ten of Joseph’s brothers went to Egypt to buy grain .
Jacob would not send Joseph’s brother Benjamin with the other brothers . He was afraid that something would happen to him .
Israel’s sons left with the others who were going to buy grain . This is because there was also famine in Canaan .
As governor of the country , Joseph was selling grain to everyone . So when Joseph’s brothers arrived , they bowed in front of him with their faces touching the ground .
Joseph recognized his brothers the moment he saw them . Even so , he acted as if he did not know them and spoke harshly to them : » Where did you come from ? « They answered : » From Canaan , to buy food . «
Even though Joseph recognized his brothers , they did not recognize him .
He remembered the dreams he had dreamed about them and said : » You are spies ! You have come to find out where our country is weak . «
» No ! « they answered . » We have come as your slaves , to buy food .
» We are all brothers . We are not spies . We are honest men . «
Joseph said to them : » No ! You have come to find out where our country is weak . «
They said : » Sir , we were twelve brothers in all , sons of the same man in the land of Canaan . One brother is dead , and the youngest is now with our father . «
» It is just as I said , « Joseph answered . » You are spies .
» This is how you will be tested : I swear by the name of the king that you will never leave unless your youngest brother comes here .
» One of you must go and get him . The rest of you will be kept under guard until the truth of what you say can be tested . Otherwise , as sure as the king lives , you are spies . «
He put all of them together in prison for three days .
On the third day , Joseph said : » Do this and live , for I too respect God .
» If you are honest men , let one of your brothers be confined in prison . Concerning the rest of you , carry grain for the famine of your households ,
» and bring your youngest brother to me . We will verify your words and you will not die . « They complied .
They said to one another : » Truly we are guilty concerning our brother , because we saw his distress when he pleaded with us , yet we would not listen . Therefore this distress has come upon us . «
Reuben said : » Did I not tell you ? Did I say , ‘ Do not sin against the boy ’ ? You would not listen ! Now comes the reckoning for his blood . «
They did not know that Joseph understood . There was an interpreter between them .
He turned away from them and wept . When he returned to them and spoke to them , he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes .
Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain and to restore every man’s money in his sack . They were to give them provisions for the journey . And thus it was done for them .
They loaded their grain on their donkeys and left .
They stopped for the night . One of them opened his sack to feed his donkey and his money was right inside his sack .
He said to his brothers : » My money has been put back ! It is right here in my sack ! « They wanted to die . They trembled and turned to each other and asked : » What has God done to us ? «
They came to their father Jacob in Canaan . Then they told him all that had happened to them . They said :
» The governor of that land spoke harshly to us and treated us like spies . «
We told him : » We are honest men , not spies .
» We were twelve brothers , sons of the same father . One is no longer with us . The youngest brother stayed with our father in Canaan .
» The governor of that land said to us , ‘ This is how I will know that you are honest men : Leave one of your brothers with me . Take food for your starving families and go .
» ‘ But bring me your youngest brother . Then I will know that you are not spies but honest men . I will give your brother back to you , and you will be able to move about freely in this country . ’ «
As they were emptying their sacks , each man found his bag of money in his sack . When they and their father saw the bags of money , they were frightened .
Their father Jacob said to them : » You are going to make me lose all my children ! Joseph is no longer with us . Simeon is no longer with us . Now you want to take Benjamin . Everything is against me ! «
So Reuben said to his father : » You may put my two sons to death if I do not bring him back to you . Let me take care of him . I will bring him back to you . «
Jacob replied : » My son will not go with you . His brother is dead , and he is the only one left . If any harm comes to him on the trip you are taking , the grief would drive this gray-haired old man to his grave ! «
The famine was extremely bad in the land .
When they finished eating the grain they brought from Egypt , Israel said to his sons : » Go back and buy us a little more food . «
Judah said to him : » The man gave us strict warning ! He said : ‘ You will not be allowed to see me again unless your brother is with you . ’
» If you let our brother go with us , we will go and buy food for you .
‘ » If you will not let him go , we will not go . The man said to us : ‘ You will not be allowed to see me again unless your brother is with you . ’ «
Israel asked : » Why have you made trouble for me by telling the man you had another brother ? «
They answered : » The man kept asking about our family and us . He asked , ‘ Is your father still alive ? Do you have another brother ? ’ ’ We simply answered his questions . How could we possibly know he would say , ‘ Bring your brother here ’ ? «
Then Judah said to his father Israel : » Send the boy along with me . Let us get going so that we will not starve to death .
» I guarantee that he will come back . You can hold me responsible for him . If I do not bring him back to you and place him here in front of you , you can blame me the rest of my life .
» If we had not waited so long , we could have made this trip twice by now . «
Their father Israel said : » If that is the way it has to be , then take the man a gift . Put some of the best products of the land in your bags . Take a little balm , a little honey , gum , myrrh , pistachio nuts , and almonds .
» Take twice as much money with you , because you must take back the money that was returned in the top of your sacks . Maybe it was a mistake .
» Take your brother and return at once .
» May God Almighty cause the man to have pity on you , so that he will give Benjamin and your other brother back to you . As for me , if I must lose my children , I must lose them . «
So the brothers took the gifts and twice as much money , and set out for Egypt with Benjamin . There they presented themselves to Joseph .
He saw Benjamin and told the servant in charge of his house : » Take these men to my house . Slaughter an animal and cook it , so they can eat with me at noon . «
The servant did as he was told . He took the brothers to Joseph’s house .
On the way they were worried and started talking : » We are being taken there because of the money that was put back in our sacks last time . He will arrest us and take our donkeys . He will make us his slaves ! «
When they arrived at Joseph’s house , they said to the servant in charge :
» We came to Egypt once before to buy grain .
» When we stopped for the night , we each found in our grain sacks the exact amount we had paid . We have brought that money back .
» We brought enough money to buy more grain . We do not know who put the money in our sacks . «
» It is all right , « the servant replied . » Do not worry . The God you and your father worship must have put the money there , because your money came first to me . « Then he brought Simeon out to them .
The servant took them into Joseph’s house . He gave them water to wash their feet . He also tended their donkeys .
The brothers prepared their gifts so they could give them to Joseph at noon . For they had heard they were going to eat there .
Joseph came home and they gave him the gifts they had brought . They bowed down to him .
Joseph asked how they were . He said : » What about your elderly father ? Is he still alive ? «
They answered : » Your servant our father is still alive and well . « Again they bowed down to Joseph .
Joseph looked around and saw his brother Benjamin . He said : » This must be the youngest brother you told me about . God bless you , my son . «
Right away he rushed off to his room and cried because of his love for Benjamin .
After washing his face and returning , he was able to control himself . He said : » Serve the meal ! «
Joseph was served at a table by himself . His brothers were served at another . The Egyptians sat at yet another table . This is because Egyptians felt it was disgusting to eat with Hebrews .
To the surprise of Joseph’s brothers , they were seated in front of him according to their ages , from the oldest to the youngest .
They were served food from Joseph’s table . And Benjamin was given five times as much as each of the others . So Joseph’s brothers drank with him and had a good time .
Later , Joseph told the servant in charge of his house : » Fill the men’s grain sacks with as much as they can hold and put their money in the sacks .
» Also put my silver cup in the sack of the youngest brother . « The servant did as he was told .
When it was light the men took their donkeys and left .
They just left the city and were not far off , when Joseph said to the man in charge of his house : » Follow the men and when you overtake them , say to them : ‘ Why have you repaid evil for good ?
» ‘ Is this the cup that my master drinks from and that he uses for telling the future ? What you have done is evil ! ’ «
When he caught up with them , he repeated these words to them .
They answered him : » What do you mean , Sir , by talking like this ? We swear that we have done no such thing .
» You know that we brought back to you from the land of Canaan the money we found in the top of our sacks . Why should we steal silver or gold from your master’s house ?
» If you find that one of us has the cup , then kill him . The rest of us will become your slaves . «
» Good ! « the man replied . » I would do what you have said . But only the one who has the cup will become my slave . The rest of you can go free . «
Each of the brothers quickly put his sack on the ground and opened it .
Joseph’s servant started searching the sacks . They began with the one that belonged to the oldest brother . When he came to Benjamin’s sack , he found the cup .
This upset the brothers so much that they began tearing their clothes in sorrow . Then they loaded their donkeys and returned to the city .
When Judah and his brothers got there , Joseph was still at home . So they bowed down to Joseph .
He asked them : » What have you done ? Did you not know I could find out ? «
» Sir , what can we say ? « Judah replied . » How can we prove we are innocent ? God has shown that we are guilty . And now all of us are your slaves , especially the one who had the cup . «
He said : » It is far from me that I should do this . The man in whose hand the cup is found , he shall be my servant . As for you , you go in peace to your father . «
Judah went up to Joseph and said : » Please , Sir , let me speak openly with you . Do not be angry with me , although you are equal to Pharaoh .
» Sir , you asked us , ‘ Do you have a father or a brother ? ’
» We answered , ‘ We have a father who is old and a younger brother born to him when he was already old . The boy’s brother is dead . He is the only one of his mother’s sons left , and his father loves him . ’
‘ Then you said to us , ‘ Bring him here to me so that I can see him myself . ’
» We replied , ‘ The boy cannot leave his father . If the boy leaves him , his father will die . ’
» Then you said you will not be admitted to my presence again unless your youngest brother comes with you . ’
» We went back and told our father what you said .
» He told us to return and buy a little food .
» We answered , ‘ We cannot go . We will not be admitted to the man’s presence unless our youngest brother is with us . We can go only if our youngest brother also goes . ’
» Our father said , ‘ You know that my wife Rachel bore me only two sons .
» ‘ One has already left me . He must have been torn to pieces by wild animals , because I have not seen him since he left .
» ‘ If you take this one from me now and something happens to him , the sorrow you would cause me would kill me , as old as I am . ’
» That is why Benjamin must be with us when I go back to my father . He loves him so much
» that he will die if Benjamin does not come back with me .
» I promised my father I would bring him home safely . If I do not , I told my father he could blame me the rest of my life .
» Sir , I am your slave . Please let me stay here in place of Benjamin . Please let him return home with his brothers .
» How can I face my father if Benjamin is not with me ? I could not bear to see my father in such sorrow . «
Joseph could no longer control himself in front of those standing near him . He sent them out of the room and when he was alone with his brothers he made himself known to them . Joseph could no longer control his feelings in front of his servants . He sent them out of the room . When he was alone with his brothers , he told them : » I am Joseph ! «
He cried so loudly that the Egyptians heard him . In fact , Pharaoh’s household heard about it .
Joseph said to his brothers : » I am Joseph ! Is my father still alive ? « His brothers could not answer him because they were afraid of him .
» Please come closer to me , « Joseph said to his brothers . They came closer . He said : » I am Joseph , the brother you sold into slavery in Egypt !
» Dear brothers , do not be sad or angry with yourselves that you sold me . God sent me ahead of you to save lives .
» The famine has been in the land for two years . There will be five more years without plowing or harvesting .
» God sent me ahead of you to make sure that you would have descendants on the earth , and to save your lives in an amazing way .
» It was not you who sent me here , but God . He has made me like a father to Pharaoh . He made me lord over his entire household , and ruler of Egypt .
» Hurry back to my father and tell him , ‘ This is what your son Joseph says : » God has made me lord of Egypt . Come here to me immediately !
» ‘ » Live in the land of Goshen . You will be near me . Live there with your children and your grandchildren , as well as your flocks , your herds , and everything you have .
» ‘ » I will provide for you in Egypt . For there will be five more years of famine . Then you , your family , and all who belong to you will not lose all that you have . « ’
» You and my brother Benjamin can see for yourselves that I am the one who is speaking to you .
» You must tell my father of my entire splendor in Egypt . Tell him all that you have seen . Hurry and bring my father down here . «
Then he fell on his brother Benjamin’s neck huged his brother and wept , and Benjamin wept on his neck .
He kissed all his brothers and wept on them . Afterward his brothers talked with him .
When the news reached the palace that Joseph’s brothers had come , the king and his officials were pleased .
The king said to Joseph : » Tell your brothers to load their animals and to return to the land of Canaan .
» Have them get their father and their families and come back here . I will give them the best of the land in Egypt . They will have more than enough to live on .
» Tell them to take wagons with them from Egypt to bring their wives and small children and to bring their father with them .
» They should not worry about leaving their possessions behind . The best in the whole land of Egypt will be theirs . «
The sons of Israel did as they were told . Joseph gave them wagons filled with food for the trip , as the king had ordered .
Joseph gave some new clothes to each of his brothers . He gave Benjamin five new outfits and three hundred pieces of silver .
To his father he sent ten donkeys loaded with the best things in Egypt . And ten other donkeys loaded with grain and bread and other food for the return trip .
Then he sent his brothers off and told them : » Do not argue on the way home ! «
Joseph’s brothers left Egypt . When they arrived in Canaan ,
they told their father that Joseph was still alive and was the ruler of Egypt . But their father was so surprised that he could not believe them .
Then they told him everything Joseph said . When he saw the wagons Joseph had sent , he felt much better .
He said : » Now I can believe you ! My son Joseph must really be alive . I will get to see him before I die . «
Jacob Israel packed up everything he owned and left for Egypt . On the way he stopped near the town of Beer-sheba and offered sacrifices to the God his father Isaac had worshiped .
That night , God spoke to him and said : » Jacob ! Jacob ! « » Here I am , « Jacob answered .
God said : » I am God ! I am the same God your father worshiped . Do not be afraid to go to Egypt . I will give you so many descendants that one day they will become a nation .
» I will go to Egypt with you . I will make sure you come back again . Joseph will close your eyes when you die . «
Jacob left Beer-sheba . Israel’s sons put their father Jacob , their children , and their wives in the wagons Pharaoh had sent to bring him back .
They took their livestock and the possessions they had acquired in Canaan . Jacob and all his family arrived in Egypt .
He brought his sons , his grandsons , his daughters , and his granddaughters , his entire family .
These are the names of Israel’s descendants Jacob and his descendants who arrived in Egypt . Reuben was Jacob’s firstborn .
The sons of Reuben were Hanoch , Pallu , Hezron , and Carmi .
The sons of Simeon were Jemuel , Jamin , Ohad , Jachin , Zohar , and Shaul , the son of a Canaanite woman .
The sons of Levi were Gershon , Kohath , and Merari .

The sons of Issachar were Tola , Puvah , Iob , and Shimron .
The sons of Zebulun were Sered , Elon , and Jahleel .
These were the sons Leah gave to Jacob in Paddan-aram , in addition to his daughter Dinah . The total number of these sons and daughters was thirty-three .
The sons of Gad were Ziphion , Haggi , Shuni , Ezbon , Eri , Arodi , and Areli .
The sons of Asher were Imnah , Ishvah , Ishvi , and Beriah . Their sister was Serah . The sons of Beriah were Heber and Malchiel .
These were the descendants of Zilpah , whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah . She gave birth to these children for Jacob . The total was sixteen .
The sons of Jacob’s wife Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin .
In Egypt , Manasseh and Ephraim were born to Joseph by Asenath , daughter of Potiphera , priest from the city of On .
The sons of Benjamin were Bela , Becher , Ashbel , Gera , Naaman , Ehi , Rosh , Muppim , Huppim , and Ard .
These were the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacob . The total was fourteen .
The son of Dan was Hushim .
The sons of Naphtali were Jahzeel , Guni , Jezer , and Shillem .
These were the descendants of Bilhah , whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel . She gave birth to these sons for Jacob . The total was seven .
The total number of Jacob’s direct descendants who went with him to Egypt was sixty-six . This did not include the wives of Jacob’s sons .
Joseph had two sons who were born in Egypt . There were a total of seventy people in Jacob’s household who went to Egypt .
Jacob sent Judah ahead to ask Joseph to meet them in Goshen . When they arrived ,
Joseph got in his chariot and went to Goshen to meet his father . When they met , Joseph threw his arms around his father’s neck and cried for a long time .
Jacob said to Joseph : » Now I am ready to die . Now that I have seen you and know that you are still alive . «
Joseph said to his brothers and the rest of his father’s family : » I must go and tell the king that my brothers and all my father’s family , who were living in Canaan , have come to me .
» I will tell him that you are shepherds and take care of livestock . And that you have brought your flocks and herds and everything else that belongs to you .
» The king will call for you . He will ask what your occupation is .
» Be sure to tell him that you have taken care of livestock all your lives , just as your ancestors did . In this way he will let you live in the region of Goshen . Joseph said this because Egyptians will have nothing to do with shepherds consider shepherds loathsome .
Joseph took five of his brothers and went to the king . He told him : » My father and my brothers have come from Canaan with their flocks , their herds , and all that they own . They are now in the region of Goshen . «
Then he presented his brothers to the king .
The king asked : » What is your occupation ? « » We are shepherds , Sir , just as our ancestors were , « they answered .
» We have come to live in this country . The famine is so severe in the land of Canaan that there is no pasture for our flocks . Please give us permission to live in the region of Goshen . «
The king said to Joseph : » Now that your father and your brothers have arrived ,
» the land of Egypt is theirs . Let them settle in the region of Goshen , the best part of the land . If there are any capable men among them , put them in charge of my own livestock . «
Joseph brought his father Jacob and presented him to the king . Jacob gave the king his blessing .
The king asked him : » How old are you ? «
Jacob answered : » My life of wandering has lasted a hundred and thirty years . Those years have been few and difficult , unlike the long years of my ancestors in their wanderings . «
Jacob gave the king a farewell blessing and left .
Joseph settled his father and his brothers in Egypt . He gave them property in the best of the land near the city of Rameses . This was as the king had commanded .
Joseph provided food for his father , his brothers , and all the rest of his father’s family , including the very youngest .
The famine was so severe that there was no food anywhere . The people of Egypt and Canaan became weak with hunger .
They bought grain from Joseph . Joseph collected all the money and took it to the palace .
When all the money in Egypt and Canaan was spent , the Egyptians came to Joseph and said : » Give us food ! Do not let us die . Do something ! Our money is all gone . «
Joseph answered : » Bring your livestock . I will give you food in exchange for it if your money is all gone . «
They brought their livestock to Joseph . He gave them food in exchange for their horses , sheep , goats , cattle , and donkeys . That year he supplied them with food in exchange for all their livestock .
The following year they said to him : » We will not hide the fact from you , Sir , that our money is all gone and our livestock belongs to you . There is nothing left to give you except our bodies and our lands .
» Do not let us die . Do something ! Do not let our fields be deserted . Buy us and buy our land in exchange for food . We will be the king’s slaves . He will own our land . Give us grain to keep us alive and seed so that we can plant our fields . «
Joseph bought all the land in Egypt for the king . Every Egyptian was forced to sell his land , because the famine was so severe . All the land became the king’s property .
He Joseph removed the people into the cities from one end of the borders of Egypt to the other .
The only land he did not buy was the land that belonged to the priests . The king gave the priests an allowance to live on . So they did not have to sell their lands .
Joseph said to the people : » I have now bought you and your lands for the king . Here is seed for you to sow in your fields .
» You must give one-fifth to the king at the time of harvest . You can use the rest for seed and for food for yourselves and your families . «
They answered : » You have saved our lives . You have been good to us . We will be the king’s slaves . «
Joseph made it a law for the land of Egypt that one-fifth of the harvest should belong to the king . This law still remains in force today . Only the lands of the priests did not become the king’s property .
The Israelites lived in Egypt in the region of Goshen . They became rich and had many children .
Jacob lived in Egypt seventeen years , until he was a hundred and forty-seven years old .
When the time drew near for him to die , he called for his son Joseph and said to him : » Place your hand under my thighs and make a solemn vow that you will not bury me in Egypt .
» I want to be buried where my fathers are . Carry me out of Egypt and bury me where they are buried . « Joseph answered : » I will do as you say . «
Jacob said : » Make a vow that you will . « Joseph made the vow . Jacob gave thanks there on his bed .
Later Joseph was told that his father was ill . So he took his two sons , Manasseh and Ephraim , and went to see Jacob .
Jacob was told that his son Joseph had come to see him . He gathered his strength and sat up in bed .
Jacob said to Joseph : » Almighty God appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me .
» He promised : ‘ I will give you a large family with many descendants that will grow into a nation . I am giving you this land that will belong to you and your family from generation to generation . ’ « Hebrew : olam olam long lasting possession
Jacob went on to say : » Joseph , your two sons Ephraim and Manasseh were born in Egypt . But I accept them as my own , just as Reuben and Simeon are mine .
» Any children you have later will be considered yours . Their inheritance will come from Ephraim and Manasseh .
» Your mother Rachel died in Canaan after we left northern Syria and before we reached Bethlehem . I had to bury her along the way . «
Then Israel saw Joseph’s sons . He asked Joseph : » Who are these boys ? « Joseph answered :
» They are my sons . God has given them to me here in Egypt . « » Bring them to me , « Jacob said . » I want to give them my blessing . « Joseph brought the boys to him .
Israel’s eyesight was failing because of old age . He could hardly see . So Joseph brought his sons close to his father . Israel hugged them and kissed them .
Israel said to Joseph : » I never expected to see you again . Now God has even let me see your sons . «
Joseph took them off his father’s lap and bowed with his face touching the ground .
Then Joseph took both of them , Ephraim on his right , facing Israel’s left , and Manasseh on his left , facing Israel’s right , and brought them close to him .
But Israel crossed his hands and reached out . He put his right hand on Ephraim’s head , although Ephraim was the younger son . He put his left hand on Manasseh’s head , although Manasseh was older .
Jacob blessed Joseph . He said : » May God , in whose presence my grandfather Abraham and my father Isaac walked , may this God who has been my shepherd all my life to this very day ,
» May the being who rescued me from all evil bless these boys ! May they be called by my name and by the names of my grandfather Abraham and my father Isaac . May they have many children on the earth . «
Joseph saw that his father had put his right hand on Ephraim’s head . Joseph did not like it . So he took his father’s hand in order to move it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s .
He said to his father : » That is not right , Father ! This is the firstborn . Put your right hand on his head . «
His father refused and said : » I know , Son , I know ! Manasseh , too , will become a nation . He , too , will be important . Nevertheless , his younger brother will be more important than he . His descendants will become many nations . «
That day he blessed them . He said : » Because of you , Israel will speak this blessing : ‘ May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh ! ’ ’ In this way Israel put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh . «
Then Israel said to Joseph : » I am about to die . God will be with you . He will bring you back to the land of your fathers .
» I am giving you one more mountain ridge than your brothers . I took it from the Amorites with my own sword and bow . «
Jacob called for his sons . He said : » Gather around , and I will tell you what will happen to you in the future .
» Come together and listen , sons of Jacob . Listen to your father Israel .
» Reuben , you are my firstborn ; you are my strength and the first child of my manhood . You are the proudest and strongest of all my sons .
» You are like a raging flood . But you will not be the most important , for you slept with my concubine . You dishonored your father’s bed .
» Simeon and Levi are brothers . They use their weapons to commit violence .
» I will not join in their secret talks . I will not take part in their meetings . They killed people in anger . They crippled bulls for sport .
» A curse is on their anger , because it is so fierce . And a curse is on their fury , because it is so cruel . I will scatter them throughout the land of Israel . I will disperse them among its people .
» Judah , your brothers will praise you . You hold your enemies by the neck . Your brothers will bow down before you .
» Judah is like a lion , killing his victim and returning to his den . He is like a lion stretching out and lying down . No one dares disturb him .
» The royal scepter shall not depart from Judah . His descendants will always rule . Nations will bring him tribute and bow in obedience before him . This , until Shiloh comes and all will obey him .
» He will tie his donkey to a grapevine , his colt to the best vine . He will wash his clothes in wine , his garments in the blood of grapes .
» His eyes are darker than wine . His teeth are whiter than milk .
» Zebulun will live by the coast . He will have ships by the coast . His border will go as far as Sidon .
» Issachar is a strong donkey , lying down between the saddlebags .
» When he sees that his resting place is good and that the land is pleasant , he will bend his back to the burden and will become a slave laborer .
» Dan will judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel .
» Dan will be a snake on a road , a viper on a path that bites a horse’s heels so that its rider falls backwards .
» I wait with hope for your salvation , O Jehovah .
» Gad will be attacked by a band of raiders . He will strike back at their heels .
» Asher’s food will be rich . He will provide delicacies fit for a king .
» Naphtali is a deer set free with beautiful fawns words .
» Joseph is a fruitful tree , a fruitful tree by a spring , with branches climbing over a wall .
» Archers provoked him , shot at him , and harassed him .
» His bow stayed steady ! His arms remained limber because of the help of the Mighty One of Jacob , because of the name of the Shepherd , the Rock of Israel ,
» because of the God of your father who helps you , because of the Almighty who blesses you from the heavens above , blessings from the deep springs below the ground , blessings from breasts and womb .
» The blessings of your father are greater than the blessings of the oldest mountains and the riches of the ancient hills . May these blessings rest on the head of Joseph , on the crown of the prince among his brothers .
» Benjamin is a ravenous wolf . In the morning and evening he destroys his enemies . «
These are the twelve tribes of Israel . This is how Jacob blessed each of them .
Jacob told his sons : » Soon I will die . I want you to bury me in Machpelah Cave .
» Abraham bought the cave from Ephron the Hittite to use as a burial place . It is near the field of Machpelah . It is also near the town of Mamre in Canaan .
» Abraham and his wife Sarah are buried there . Isaac and his wife Rebekah are buried there . I also buried Leah there .
» The field and the cave in it were bought from the Hittites . «
Jacob finished giving these instructions to his sons . He pulled his feet into his bed . He took his last breath and joined his ancestors in death .
Joseph threw himself on his father . He cried over him , and kissed him .
Then Joseph gave orders to embalm his father’s body .
It took forty days , which is the normal time for embalming . The Egyptians mourned for him seventy days .
When the time of mourning was over , Joseph said to the king’s officials : » Please take this message to the king :
» When my father was about to die , he made me promise him that I would bury him in the tomb that he had prepared in the land of Canaan . Please , let me go and bury my father . Then I will come back . «
The king replied : » By all means go and bury your father , as you promised you would . «
So Joseph went to bury his father . All the king’s officials , the senior men of his court , and all the leading men of Egypt went with Joseph .
His family , including his brothers , and the rest of his father’s family all went with him . Only their small children and their sheep , goats , and cattle stayed in the region of Goshen .
Men in chariots and men on horseback also went with him . It was a very large group .
They mourned loudly for a long time at the threshing place at Atad east of the Jordan . Joseph performed mourning ceremonies for seven days .
The citizens of Canaan saw those people mourning at Atad . They said : » What a solemn ceremony of mourning the Egyptians are holding ! « That is why the place was named Abel-mizraim .
Jacob’s sons did as he had commanded them .
They carried his body to Canaan and buried it in the cave at Machpelah east of Mamre . He was buried in the field Abraham bought from Ephron the Hittite for a burial ground .
After the funeral , Joseph , his brothers , and everyone else returned to Egypt .
After Jacob died , Joseph’s brothers said to each other : » What if Joseph still hates us and wants to get even with us for all the cruel things we did to him ? «
Thus they sent word to Joseph , saying : » Your father gave us orders before his death . He said ,
» ‘ You are to say to Joseph : » Let the wrongdoing of your brothers be overlooked , and the evil they did to you . If it is your pleasure , forgive the sin of the servants of your father’s God . « ’ « Upon hearing these words Joseph was overcome with weeping .
Then his brothers also came and immediately bowed down in front of him . » We are your slaves ! « they said .
Joseph replied to them : » Do not be afraid ! I cannot take God’s place .
» Even though you planned evil against me , God planned good to come out of it . This was to keep many people alive , as he is doing now .
» You have nothing to fear . I will take care of you and your children . « So he reassured them with kind words that touched their hearts .
Joseph continued to live in Egypt with his father’s family . He was a hundred and ten years old when he died .
Joseph lived long enough to see Ephraim’s children and grandchildren . He also lived to see the children of Manasseh’s son Machir . He welcomed them into his family .
Before Joseph died , he told his brothers : » I will not live much longer . God will take care of you . He will lead you out of Egypt to the land he promised Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob .
» Promise me that you will take my body with you when God leads you to that land . «
Joseph died in Egypt at the age of one hundred and ten . His body was embalmed and put in a coffin .
These are the names of the sons of Israel who came with their families and with Jacob to Egypt :
Reuben , Simeon , Levi , and Judah ;
Issachar , Zebulun , and Benjamin ;
Dan and Naphtali and Gad and Asher .
Joseph was already in Egypt . The total number of Jacob’s descendants was seventy .
Joseph , all his brothers , and that entire generation died .
The children of Israel had many children . They became so numerous and strong that the land was filled with them .
A new king , who knew nothing about Joseph , began to rule in Egypt .
He said to his people : » There are too many Israelites ! They are stronger than we are .
» We must outsmart them or they will increase in number . If war breaks out they will leave the country and join our enemies to fight against us . «
So the Egyptians put slave masters over them in order to oppress them through forced labor . They built Pithom and Rameses as supply storage cities for Pharaoh .
However the more the Israelites were oppressed , the more they increased in number and spread out . The Egyptians could not stand them any longer .
They forced the Israelites to work hard as slaves .
They made their lives bitter with backbreaking work in mortar and bricks and every kind of work in the fields . All the jobs the Egyptians gave them were brutally hard work .
The king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives . Shiphrah and Puah were among them .
He said : » When you help the Hebrew women give birth on the birth stool , if it is a son you shall put him to death . If it is a daughter , then she shall live . «
The midwives respected God and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them . They let the boys live .
So the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said : » Why have you let the boys live ? «
The midwives replied to Pharaoh : » Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women . They are vigorous and give birth before the midwife can get to them . «
God was good to the midwives , and the people multiplied , and became very mighty .
Because the midwives respected God , He established households for them .
Then Pharaoh commanded all his people : Every son who is born must be thrown into the Nile River . However , keep every daughter alive .
A man from Levi’s family married a Levite woman .
The woman became pregnant and bore a son . She saw how beautiful he was and hid him for three months .
When she could not hide him any longer , she took a basket made of papyrus reeds and coated it with tar and pitch . She put the baby in it and set it among the papyrus reeds near the bank of the Nile River .
The baby’s sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him .
The king’s daughter came to the river to bathe . Her servants walked along the bank . Suddenly she noticed the basket in the papyrus reeds and sent a slave woman to get it .
She opened it and saw a baby boy . He was crying , and she felt sorry for him . » This is one of the Hebrew babies , « she said .
His sister asked her : » Shall I go and call a Hebrew woman to nurse the baby for you ? «
» Please do , « she answered . So the girl went and brought the baby’s own mother .
Pharaoh’s daughter told her : » Take care of this child , and I will pay you . The baby’s mother carried him home and took care of him . «
When he was old enough , she took him to the king’s daughter , who adopted him . She named him Moses because she said : » I pulled him out of the water . «
After Moses had grown up , he went out to where his own people his brothers were hard at work . He saw an Egyptian beating one of them .
Moses looked around to see if anyone was watching . Then he killed the Egyptian and hid his body in the sand .
The next day when Moses went out , he saw two Hebrews fighting . So he went to the man who started the fight and asked : » Why are you beating up one of your own people ? «
The man replied : » Who made you a prince or a judge over us ? Are you intending to kill me as you killed the Egyptian ? « Moses was afraid and said : » Surely the matter has become known . «
When Pharaoh heard of this matter , he tried to kill Moses . But Moses fled from the presence of Pharaoh and settled in the land of Midian by a well .
The priest of Midian had seven daughters . They came to draw water and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock .
Then the shepherds came and drove them away . Moses stood up and helped them water their flock .
When they returned to Reuel their father , he said , » Why have you come back so soon today ? «
They said : » An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds . He drew water for us and watered the flock . «
He asked his daughters : » Where is he ? Why have you left the man ? Call him , that he may eat bread . «
Moses was content to live with the man . He gave Moses his daughter Zipporah .
She bore a son , and he called his name Gershom . For he said : » I have been a stranger in a strange land . «
Time went by and the king of Egypt died . The Israelites still groaned because they were slaves . So they cried out , and their cries for help went up to God .
God heard their groaning . He remembered his promise to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob .
God saw the Israelites being oppressed and was concerned about them .
One day Moses was taking care of the flock of his father-in-law Jethro , the priest of Midian . He led the flock across the desert to Sinai , the holy mountain .
There the angel of Jehovah appeared to him in a flame of fire coming from the middle of a bush . Moses saw that the bush was on fire but that it was not burning up .
» This is strange , « he thought . » Why is the bush not burning up ? I will go closer and see . «
Jehovah saw that Moses came closer . He called to him from the middle of the bush : » Moses ! Moses ! « Moses answered : » Yes , here I am . «
God said : » Do not come any closer . Take off your sandals , because you are standing on holy ground .
» I am the God of your ancestors , the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . « Moses covered his face , because he was afraid to look at God .
Jehovah said : » I have seen how my people are suffering as slaves in Egypt . I have heard them beg for my help because of the way they are being mistreated . I feel sorry for them .
» I have come down to rescue them from the Egyptians . I will bring my people out of Egypt into a country where there is good land , rich with milk and honey . I will give them the land where the Canaanites , Hittites , Amorites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites now live .
» My people have begged for my help . I have seen how cruel the Egyptians are to them .
» Now go to Pharaoh ! I am sending you to lead my people out of his country . «
But Moses said : » Who am I to go to Pharaoh and lead your people out of Egypt ? «
God said : » I will be with you ! This shall be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you : when you have brought the people out of Egypt , you shall worship God at this mountain . «
Then Moses said to God : » Behold , I am going to the sons of Israel . I will say to them : ‘ The God of your fathers has sent me to you . ’ ’ Now they may ask me : ‘ What is His name ? ’ ’ What shall I say to them ? ’ «
God then said to Moses : » I exist and I WILL BE WHO I WILL BE . « You shall say to the sons of Israel : » I WILL BE , has sent me to you . ’ « Hebrew : hayah , » I was , I am , I will be « gives evidence of God’s eternal existence
God , further said to Moses : » You shall say to the sons of Israel : ‘ JEHOVAH , the God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob , has sent me to you . ’ ’ JEHOVAH THIS IS MY NAME FOREVER ! This is my memorial-name to all generations .
Go and gather the elders of Israel together and say to them : JEHOVAH , the God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , Isaac and Jacob , has appeared to me . He said : » I am indeed concerned about you and what has been done to you in Egypt . «
» So I said : ‘ I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite , to a land flowing with milk and honey . « ’
» They will listen to what you say . You with the elders of Israel will approach the king of Egypt . You will say to him : ‘ Jehovah the God of the Hebrews , has met with us . So now , please , let us go a three days journey into the wilderness , that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God . ’
» I know that the king of Egypt will not permit you to go , except under compulsion .
» So I will stretch out my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders that I will do in it’s midst . After that he will let you go .
» I will grant this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians . When you go you will not go empty handed .
» But every woman shall ask of her neighbor and the woman who lives in her house , articles of silver and articles of gold , and clothing . You will put them on your sons and daughters . Thus you will plunder the Egyptians . «
Moses responded : » What if they will not believe me or listen to what I say ? For they may say : ‘ Jehovah has not appeared to you . ’ «
Jehovah asked him : » What is that in your hand ? « He answered : » A shepherd’s staff . «
Jehovah said : » Throw it on the ground . « When Moses threw it on the ground , it became a snake , and he ran away from it .
Jehovah said to Moses : » Reach down and pick it up by the tail . « So Moses reached down and caught it . Suddenly it became a walking stick again .
Jehovah said : » Do this to prove to the Israelites that Jehovah , the God of their ancestors , the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , has appeared to you . «
Jehovah spoke to Moses again : » Put your hand inside your robe . « Moses obeyed . When he took his hand out , it was diseased , covered with white spots , like snow .
Jehovah said : » Put your hand inside your robe again . « He did so , and when he took it out this time , it was healthy , just like the rest of his body .
Jehovah said : » If they will not believe you or be convinced by the first sign , then this one will convince them .
» If in spite of these two signs they still will not believe you , and if they refuse to listen to what you say , take some water from the Nile and pour it on the ground . The water will turn into blood . «
Moses said : » O Jehovah I am not a man of words . I have never been so , and am not now , even after what you have said to your servant . Talking is hard for me , and I am slow of tongue . «
Jehovah said to him : » Who has made man’s mouth ? Or who makes him mute or deaf , or seeing or blind ? Is it not I , Jehovah ?
» Now then go , and I , even I , will be with your mouth . I will teach you what you are to say . «
But Moses said : » Please , Jehovah , send the message by whomever you will . «
Then the anger of Jehovah burned against Moses , and He said : » Is there not your brother Aaron the Levite ? I know that he speaks fluently . He is coming out to meet you . When he sees you , he will be glad in his heart .
» You are to speak to him and put the words in his mouth . I will be with your mouth and his mouth . I will teach you what you are to do .
Moreover , he shall speak for you to the people . He will be as a mouth for you and you will be as God to him .
» Take your staff in your hand with which you shall perform the signs . «
Moses departed and returned to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him : » Please , let me go , that I may return to my brothers who are in Egypt , and see if they are still alive . « Jethro said to Moses : » Go in peace . «
Jehovah said to Moses in Midian : » Go back to Egypt , for all the men who were seeking your life are dead . «
So Moses took his wife and his sons and mounted them on a donkey and returned to the land of Egypt . Moses also took the staff of God in his hand .
Jehovah said to Moses : » When you go back to Egypt see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders that I have put in your power . I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go . «
» Say to Pharaoh : ‘ Thus says Jehovah , Israel is my son , my firstborn .
» ‘ So I said to you : ‘ Let My son go that he may serve me . But you have refused to let him go . Behold , I will kill your son , your firstborn . « ’ «
Now it came about at the lodging place on the way that Jehovah met him and sought to put him to death .
Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son’s foreskin and threw it at Moses’ feet . She said : » You are indeed a bridegroom of blood to me . «
So He let him alone . At that time she said : » You are a bridegroom of blood , because of the circumcision . «
Jehovah said to Aaron : » Go to meet Moses in the wilderness . « So he went and met him at the mountain of God and kissed him .
Moses told Aaron all the words Jehovah sent him to tell Moses , and all the signs that he had commanded him to do .
Then Moses and Aaron went to Egypt and assembled all the elders of the people of Israel .
Aaron told them everything Jehovah had said to Moses . He also did the miraculous signs for the people .
The people believed them . When they heard that Jehovah was concerned about the people of Israel and that he had seen their misery , they knelt , bowed low and worshiped .
Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh . They said : » Jehovah , the God of Israel , says : ‘ Let My people go that they may celebrate a feast to me in the wilderness . ’ «
But Pharaoh responded : » Who is Jehovah , that I should obey his voice to let Israel go ? I do not know Jehovah , and besides , I will not let Israel go . «
Then they said : » The God of the Hebrews met with us . Please , let us go on a three-day journey into the wilderness . Then we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God . Otherwise he will fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword . «
The king of Egypt replied : » Moses and Aaron , why do you distract the people from their work ? Get back to work ! «
Pharaoh added : » Look how many people there are in the land ! Do you want them to quit working ? «
Pharaoh gave these orders to the slave drivers and foremen :
» Do not give the people any more straw to make bricks as you have been doing . Let them gather their own straw .
» Insist that they make the same number of bricks they were making before . Making fewer bricks will not be acceptable . They are lazy ! That is why they are crying : Let us go offer sacrifices to our God .
» Make the work harder for these people so that they will be too busy to listen to lies . «
The slave drivers and the Israelite foremen went out and said to the Israelites : » The king has said that he will not supply you with any more straw .
» He says that you must go and get it for yourselves wherever you can find it . You must still make the same number of bricks . «
So the people went all over Egypt looking for straw .
The slave bosses were hard on them . They kept saying : » Each day you have to make as many bricks as you did when you were given straw . «
The bosses beat the men in charge of the slaves and said : » Why did you not force the slaves to make as many bricks yesterday and today as they did before ? «
Finally , the men in charge of the slaves went to the king and asked : » Why are you treating us like this ?
» No one brings us any straw . Yet we are still ordered to make the same number of bricks . We are beaten with whips , and your own people are to blame . «
The king replied : » You are lazy . You are just lazy ! That is why you keep asking me to let you go and sacrifice to Jehovah .
» Get back to work ! You will not be given straw , but you must still make the same number of bricks . «
The Israelite foremen realized they were in trouble when they were told : » Do not make fewer bricks each day than you are supposed to . «
Leaving the Pharaoh , they found Moses and Aaron waiting for them .
They said : » May Jehovah see what you have done and judge you ! You have made Pharaoh and his officials hate us . You have given them an excuse to kill us . «
Moses went back to Jehovah and asked : » Why have you brought this trouble on your people ? Why did you send me ?
» Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak for you , he has treated your people cruelly , and you have done nothing at all to rescue your people . «
Jehovah said to Moses : » Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh . I will show him my power . He will let my people go ! I will show him my power , and he will throw them out of his country . «
God spoke further to Moses and said to him : » I am Jehovah .
» I appeared to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , as God Almighty , but by my name , Jehovah , I did not make myself known to them .
» I also established my covenant with them , to give them the land of Canaan , the land in which they lived as foreigners .
» Furthermore I have heard the groaning of the sons of Israel . This is because the Egyptians are holding them in bondage . I have remembered my covenant .
» Tell the sons of Israel : ‘ I am Jehovah . I will bring you out from under the oppression of the Egyptians . I will free you from slavery ! I will rescue you with my powerful arm and with mighty acts of judgment . ’
» I will make you my people , and I will be your God . You will know that I am Jehovah your God . I brought you out from under the forced labor of the Egyptians .
» I will bring you to the land I solemnly swore to give to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . I will give it to you as your own possession . I am Jehovah ! ’ «
Moses reported this to the Israelites . But they would not listen to him . For they were so discouraged by their backbreaking work .
Then Jehovah told Moses :
» Demand that Pharaoh king of Egypt let the sons of Israel go . «
But Moses replied : » I am not a powerful speaker . If the sons of Israel will not listen to me , why should the king of Egypt ? «
Jehovah sent Aaron and Moses with a message for the sons of Israel and for the king . He also ordered Aaron and Moses to free the people from Egypt .
The following men were the heads of their father’s households : The sons of Reuben , Jacob’s oldest son , were Hanoch , Pallu , Hezron , and Carmi .
The sons of Simeon : Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman ; these are the families of Simeon .
These are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations : Gershon and Kohath and Merari . Levi lived one hundred and thirty-seven years .
The sons of Gershon : Libni and Shimei , according to their families .
The sons of Kohath : Amram and Izhar and Hebron and Uzziel . Kohath lived one hundred and thirty-three years .
The sons of Merari : Mahli and Mushi . These are the families of the Levites according to their generations .
Amram married his father’s sister Jochebed , and she bore him Aaron and Moses . Amram lived one hundred and thirty-seven years .
The sons of Izhar : Korah and Nepheg and Zichri .
The sons of Uzziel : Mishael and Elzaphan and Sithri .
Aaron married Elisheba , the daughter of Amminadab , the sister of Nahshon , and she bore him Nadab and Abihu , Eleazar and Ithamar .
The sons of Korah : Assir and Elkanah and Abiasaph ; these are the families of the Korahites .
Aaron’s son Eleazar married one of the daughters of Putiel , and she bore him Phinehas . These are the heads of the fathers’ households of the Levites according to their families .
It was the same Aaron and Moses to whom Jehovah said : » Bring out the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their hosts . «
They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing out the sons of Israel from Egypt . It was the same Moses and Aaron .
On the day when Jehovah spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt ,
Jehovah said to Moses : » I am Jehovah ! Speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak to you . «
But Moses protested to Jehovah : » I am unskilled in speech . How then will Pharaoh listen to me ? «
Jehovah said to Moses : » See , I make you as God to Pharaoh , and your brother Aaron shall be your prophet .
» You shall speak all that I command you . Your brother Aaron shall speak to Pharaoh that he let the sons of Israel go out of his land .
» I will harden Pharaoh’s heart that I may multiply my signs and wonders in the land of Egypt .
» Pharaoh will not listen to you . Then I will use my power to punish lay my hand upon Egypt severely . I will bring my people , the sons of Israel , out of Egypt in organized family groups .
» The Egyptians will know that I am Jehovah when I use my power against Egypt and bring the sons of Israel out of there . «
Moses and Aaron did as Jehovah commanded them .
Moses was eighty years old and Aaron was eighty-three when they talked to Pharaoh .
Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron :
» Pharaoh will say : ‘ Give me a sign to prove that God has sent you . ’ ’ Tell Aaron : ‘ Take your shepherd’s staff and throw it down in front of Pharaoh . It will become a large snake . ’
Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh . They did as Jehovah commanded . Aaron threw his staff down in front of Pharaoh and his officials . It became a large snake .
Then Pharaoh sent for his wise men and sorcerers . These Egyptian magicians did the same thing using their magic spells .
Each of them threw his staff down . They all became large snakes . But Aaron’s staff swallowed theirs .
Pharaoh continued to be stubborn . Just as Jehovah had predicted , he would not listen to them .
Jehovah said to Moses : » Pharaoh is being stubborn . He will not let my people go .
» In the morning meet Pharaoh when he is on his way to the Nile . Wait for him on the bank of the river . Take the staff that turned into a snake .
» Say to Pharaoh : ‘ Jehovah the God of the Hebrews sent me to tell you , Let my people go to worship me in the wilderness . So far you have not listened . ’ «
» Jehovah says : ‘ This is the way you will recognize that I am Jehovah : I will strike the Nile with this staff in my hand . The water will turn into blood .
‘ The fish in the Nile will die . The river will stink . The Egyptians will not be able to drink any water from the Nile . « ’ «
Jehovah then spoke to Moses : » Tell Aaron , Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt ; its rivers , canals , ponds , and all its reservoirs . They will turn into blood . There will be blood everywhere in Egypt , even in the buckets of wood and stone pitchers . «
Moses and Aaron did as Jehovah commanded . Aaron raised his staff and struck the Nile in front of Pharaoh and his officials . All the water in the river turned into blood .
The fish in the Nile died . The river smelled bad . The Egyptians could not drink any water from the river . There was blood everywhere in Egypt .
But the Egyptian magicians did the same thing using their magic spells . So Pharaoh continued to be stubborn . He would not listen to Moses and Aaron , just as Jehovah predicted .
Pharaoh turned and went back to his palace . This did not change his mind and heart .
All the Egyptians dug along the Nile for water to drink because they could not drink any of the water from the river .
Seven days passed after Jehovah struck the Nile .
Then Jehovah said to Moses : » Approach Pharaoh and say to him , ‘ Jehovah says : » Let My people go , that they may serve me .
» ‘ » But if you refuse to let them go , behold , I will afflict your whole territory with frogs .
» ‘ » The Nile will swarm with frogs . They will come up and go into your house and into your bedroom and on your bed . They will go into the houses of your servants and on your people , and into your ovens and into your kneading bowls .
» ‘ » The frogs will come up on you and your people and all your servants . « ’ «
Jehovah also said to Moses : » Say to Aaron , ‘ Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers , over the streams and over the pools . Make frogs come up on the land of Egypt . ’ «
» So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt . The frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt .
» But the magicians used their secret powers to do the same thing .
» The king sent for Moses and Aaron and told them : If you ask Jehovah to take these frogs away from me and my people , I will let your people go and offer sacrifices to him . «
Moses answered : » You choose the time when I am to pray for the frogs to stop bothering you , your officials , and your people , and for them to leave your houses and be found only in the river . «
The king replied : » Do it tomorrow ! « » As you wish : « Moses agreed . » Then everyone will discover that there is no god like Jehovah !
» The frogs will no longer be found anywhere , except in the Nile . «
Moses and Aaron left the palace . Moses begged Jehovah to do something about the frogs he had sent as punishment for the king .
Jehovah did as Moses asked . The frogs in the houses , the courtyards , and the fields died .
The Egyptians piled them up in large mounds , until the land began to stink with them .
The king saw that the frogs were dead . He became stubborn again and , just as Jehovah had said , the king would not listen to Moses and Aaron .
Jehovah said to Moses : » Tell Aaron , » Strike the ground with your stick . The dust will change into gnats in all of Egypt . ’ «
So Aaron struck the ground with his stick . The dust in Egypt was turned into gnats . They swarmed over the people and the animals .
The magicians tried to use their magic to make gnats appear , but they failed . There were gnats everywhere !
The magicians said to the king : » It is the finger of God ! « God has done this ! But the king was stubborn . Just as Jehovah predicted , the king would not listen to Moses and Aaron .
Jehovah said to Moses : » Early tomorrow morning , go and meet the king as he goes to the river . Tell him that Jehovah says : ‘ Let my people go , so that they can serve me .
» ‘ » I warn you that if you refuse , I will punish you by sending flies on you , your officials , and your people . The houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies . The ground will be covered with them .
» ‘ » At that same time I will cut off the land of Goshen where my people live . No swarms of flies shall be there . Then you will know that I am Jehovah in the midst of the earth .
» ‘ » I will put a dividing line between my people and your people . This sign will happen tomorrow . « ’ «
Jehovah did what he said . Dense swarms of flies came into Pharaoh’s palace and into the houses of his officials . All over Egypt the flies ruined everything .
Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron . He said : » Go , sacrifice to your God here in this country . «
Moses replied : » It is not right to do that . The sacrifices we offer to Jehovah our God are disgusting to Egyptians . If they see us offer sacrifices that they consider disgusting , will they not stone us to death ?
» We need to travel three days into the desert to offer sacrifices to Jehovah our God , as he told us to do . «
Pharaoh said : » I will let you go , but do not go far . You may offer sacrifices to Jehovah your God in the desert and pray for me . «
Moses answered : » As soon as I leave you , I will pray to Jehovah . Tomorrow the swarms of flies will go away from you , your officials , and your people . But you must stop tricking us by not letting the people go to offer sacrifices to Jehovah . «
Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to Jehovah .
Jehovah did what Moses asked . The swarms of flies left Pharaoh , his officials , and his people . Not a single fly was left .
Again Pharaoh was stubborn and did not let the people go .
Then Jehovah said to Moses : » Go to Pharaoh , and tell him , this is what Jehovah the God of the Hebrews says : Let my people go to serve me .
» If you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them in slavery ,
Jehovah will bring a terrible plague on your livestock , including your horses , donkeys , camels , cattle , sheep , and goats .
» ‘ » Jehovah will distinguish between Israel’s livestock and the livestock of the Egyptians . The animals belonging to the Israelites will not die . « ’ «
Jehovah set a definite time : » I , Jehovah , choose tomorrow as the time when I will do this . «
The next day Jehovah did as he had said . The Egyptian’s animals all died . Not one of the animals of the Israelites died .
The king asked what had happened . He was told that none of the animals of the Israelites had died . He was stubborn and would not let the people go .
Then Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron : » Take a few handfuls of ashes from a furnace . Moses is to throw them into the air in front of the king .
» They will spread out like fine dust over all the land of Egypt . They will produce boils that become open sores on the people and the animals . «
They got some ashes and stood before the king . Moses threw them into the air . They produced boils that became open sores on the people and the animals .
The magicians were not able to appear before Moses , because they were covered with boils , like all the other Egyptians .
Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh and he did not listen to Moses and Aaron . Everything happened just as Jehovah had told Moses .
Jehovah told Moses to get up early the next morning and say to the king : » God of the Hebrews commands you to let his people go , so they can serve him !
» If you do not , he will send his worst plagues to strike you , your officials , and everyone else in your country . Then you will find out that no one can oppose Jehovah .
» He could already have sent a terrible disease and wiped you from the face of the earth .
» I have allowed you to remain , in order to show you my power and in order to proclaim my name through all the earth .
» Still you exalt yourself against my people by not letting them go .
» At this time tomorrow , I will send a very heavy hail , such as has not been seen in Egypt from the day it was founded until now .
» Bring your livestock and whatever you have in the field to safety . Every man and beast that is found in the field and is not brought home will die from the hail . «
The ones among the servants of Pharaoh who respected the word of Jehovah made his servants and his livestock flee into the houses .
He who paid no regard to the word of Jehovah left his servants and his livestock in the field .
Jehovah said to Moses : » Stretch out your hand toward the sky . Hail will fall on all the land of Egypt , on man and on beast and on every plant of the field , throughout the land of Egypt . «
Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky . Then Jehovah sent thunder and hail , and fire ran down to the earth . Jehovah rained hail on the land of Egypt .
It hailed , and lightning flashed while it hailed . This was the worst storm in all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation .
All over Egypt the hail knocked down everything that was out in the open . It struck down people , animals , and every plant in the fields and destroyed every tree in the fields .
The region of Goshen , where the Israelites lived , was the only place where there was no hail .
The king sent for Moses and Aaron and said : » This time I have sinned . Jehovah is in the right . My people and I are in the wrong .
» Pray to Jehovah ! We have had enough of this thunder and hail ! I promise to let you go . You do not have to stay here any longer . «
Moses said to him : » As soon as I go out of the city , I will lift up my hands in prayer to Jehovah . The thunder will stop . There will be no more hail . Thus you may know that the earth belongs to Jehovah .
» But I know that you and your servants do not yet respect Jehovah God . «
The flax and the barley were ruined , because the barley was ripe , and the flax was budding .
But the wheat crops ripen later , and they were not damaged .
Moses left the royal palace and the city . He lifted his arms in prayer to Jehovah . The thunder , hail , and drenching rain stopped .
The king realized that the storm was over . He disobeyed once more . He and his officials were so stubborn
that he refused to let the Israelites go . This was exactly what Jehovah said would happen .
Jehovah told Moses : » Go back to the king . I have made him and his officials stubborn , so that I could work these signs .
» I did this because I want you to tell your children and your grandchildren about the mighty things and the signs I have done in Egypt . Then all of you will know that I am Jehovah . «
Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him : » Thus says Jehovah , the God of the Hebrews , ‘ How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me ? Let my people go , that they may serve me .
» ‘ If you refuse to let my people go , behold , tomorrow I will bring locusts into your territory .
» ‘ They shall cover the surface of the land . No one will be able to see the land . They will also eat the rest of what has escaped and is left to you from the hail . They will eat every tree that sprouts for you out of the field .
» ‘ Your houses shall be filled and the houses of all your servants and the houses of all the Egyptians . This is something neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen , from the day that they came upon the earth until this day . He turned and went out from Pharaoh . ’ «
Pharaoh’s servants said to him : » How long shall this man be a snare to us ? Let the men go so that they may serve Jehovah their God . Do you not yet know that Egypt is destroyed ? «
Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh . He said to them : » Go ! Serve Jehovah your God . Who are the ones that shall go ? «
Moses said : » We will go with our young and with our old , with our sons and with our daughters . We will go with our flocks and with our herds . We must hold a feast to Jehovah . «
He said to them : » May Jehovah be with you , as I send you and your little ones away . Watch out for evil is before you .
» Not so ! You men go now and serve Jehovah . It is you who desired it . « So they were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence .
Jehovah said to Moses : » Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts . Let them come up upon the land of Egypt and eat every herb of the land , all that the hail has left . «
Moses held his staff over the land of Egypt . Jehovah made a wind from the east blow over the land all that day and all that night . By morning the east wind had brought the locusts .
They invaded all of Egypt and landed all over the country in great swarms . Never before had there been so many locusts , nor would there ever be that many again .
They covered all the ground until it was black with them . They ate all the plants and all the fruit on the trees that the hail had left . Nothing green was left on any tree or plant anywhere in Egypt .
Pharaoh quickly called for Moses and Aaron and said : » I have sinned against Jehovah your God and against you .
» Please forgive my sin one more time . Pray to Jehovah your God to take this deadly plague away from me . «
Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to Jehovah .
Jehovah changed the wind to a very strong west wind . It picked up the locusts and blew them into the Red Sea . Not one locust was left anywhere in Egypt .
But Jehovah made the king stubborn . He did not let the Israelites go .
Jehovah then said to Moses : » Raise your hand toward the sky . Darkness thick enough to be felt will cover the land of Egypt . «
Moses raised his hand toward the sky . Total darkness fell throughout Egypt for three days .
The Egyptians could not see each other . No one left his house during that time . The Israelites , however , had light where they were living .
The king called Moses . He said : » You may go and worship Jehovah . Even your women and children may go with you . But your sheep , goats , and cattle must stay here . «
Moses answered : » Then you would have to provide us with animals for sacrifices and burnt offerings to offer to Jehovah our God .
» No , we will take our animals with us ! Not one will be left behind . We must select the animals with which to worship Jehovah our God . We will not know what animals to sacrifice to him until we get there . «
Jehovah made the king stubborn . He would not let them go .
He said to Moses : » Get out of my sight ! Do not let me ever see you again ! On the day I do , you will die ! «
» You have spoken it ! « Moses answered . » You will never see me again . «
Jehovah said to Moses : » I will send only one more punishment plague on the king of Egypt and his people . After that he will let you leave . In fact , he will drive all of you out of here .
» Speak to the people of Israel and tell all of them to ask their neighbors for gold and silver jewelry . «
Jehovah made the Egyptians respect the Israelites . Indeed , the officials and all the people considered Moses to be a very great man .
Moses approached the king . He said : » I have come to let you know what Jehovah is going to do . About midnight he will go through the land of Egypt ,
and wherever he goes , the first-born son in every family will die . Your own son will die . So will the son of the lowest slave woman . Even the first-born males of cattle will die .
» Everywhere in Egypt there will be loud crying . Nothing like this has ever happened before or will ever happen again .
» But against any of the sons of Israel a dog will not even bark , whether against man or beast . This is so you may understand how Jehovah makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel . «
All these your servants will come down to me and bow themselves before me . They will say : » Go out , you and all the people who follow you . Then I will go out . « He went out from Pharaoh in hot anger .
Then Jehovah said to Moses : » Pharaoh will not listen to you , so that my signs will be multiplied in the land of Egypt . «
Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh . Yet Jehovah hardened Pharaoh’s heart . He did not let the sons of Israel go out of his land .
Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt :
» This month shall be the beginning of months for you . It is to be the first month of the year to you .
» Tell the whole community of Israel : ‘ On the tenth day of this month each man must take a sheep for his family , one animal per household .
» ‘ A household may be too small to eat a whole animal . That household and the one next-door can share one animal . Choose your animal based on the number of people and what each person can eat .
» ‘ Your animal must be a one-year-old male that has no defects . You may choose a lamb or a young goat .
» ‘ Take care of it until the fourteenth day of this month . Then at dusk , all the assembled people from the community of Israel must slaughter their animals .
» ‘ Some of the blood must be put on the two doorposts and above the door of each house where the animals are to be eaten .
» ‘ That night the animals are to be roasted and eaten , together with bitter herbs greens and unleavened bread made without yeast .
» ‘ Do not eat the meat raw or boiled . The entire animal , including its head , legs , and insides , must be roasted .
» ‘ Eat what you want that night , and the next morning burn whatever is left .
» ‘ Eat it in this manner : with your loins girded , your sandals on your feet , and your staff in your hand . Eat it in haste . It is Jehovah’s Passover . ’ «
Jehovah said : » That night I will go through the land of Egypt . I will strike down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , both man and beast . I will execute judgments against all the gods of Egypt ! I am Jehovah !
» The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you live . When I see the blood I will pass over you . No plague will befall you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt .
» This day will be a memorial to you . You shall celebrate it as a feast to Jehovah . You are to celebrate it as a permanent ordinance throughout your generations .
» You will eat unleavened bread for seven days . The first day you shall remove leaven from your houses . Whoever eats anything leavened from the first day until the seventh day will be cut off from Israel .
» You shall have a holy assembly on the first day . There should be another holy assembly on the seventh day . No work at all will be done on them , except what must be eaten by every person that alone may be prepared by you .
» You shall also observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread . That was the day I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt . Observe this day throughout your generations as a long lasting ordinance .
» In the first month , on the fourteenth day of the month at evening , you shall eat unleavened bread , until the twenty-first day of the month at evening .
» There shall be no leaven found in your houses for seven days . Whoever eats what is leavened shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel , whether he is an alien or a native of the land .
» You shall not eat anything leavened . Eat unleavened bread in all your dwellings . «
Moses called all the elders of Israel and said : » Take lambs according to your families and slay the Passover lamb .
» Take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the basin . Apply some of the blood that is in the basin to the lintel and the two doorposts . No one shall go outside the door of his house until morning .
» Jehovah will pass through to strike the Egyptians . When he sees the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe , Jehovah will pass over the door and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to kill you .
» You shall observe this event as an ordinance for you and your children from generation to generation .
» When you enter the land Jehovah will give you , as he has promised , you shall observe this rite .
» When your children ask you : What does this rite mean to you ?
» You shall say : ‘ It is a Passover sacrifice to Jehovah who passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt when He killed the Egyptians , but spared our homes . The people bowed low and worshiped . ’ «
Then the sons of Israel did just as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron .
At midnight Jehovah killed every firstborn male in Egypt from the firstborn son of Pharaoh who ruled the land to the firstborn son of the prisoner in jail , and also every firstborn animal .
Pharaoh , all his officials , and all the other Egyptians got up during the night . There was loud crying throughout Egypt because in every house someone had died .
Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron during the night . He said : » You and the Israelites must leave my people at once . Go serve Jehovah just as you requested .
» Take your flocks and herds , too , as you asked . Just go ! And bless me , too ! «
The Egyptians begged the people to leave the country quickly . They said : » We will all be dead soon ! «
The people picked up their bread dough before it had risen . They carried it on their shoulders in bowls and wrapped up in their clothes .
The sons of Israel did what Moses told them . They asked the Egyptians for gold and silver jewelry and for clothes .
Jehovah made the Egyptians generous to the people . They gave them what they asked for . So the sons of Israel stripped Egypt of its wealth .
The Israelites left Rameses to go to Succoth . There were about six hundred thousand men on foot , plus all the women and children .
Many other people also went with them , along with large numbers of sheep , goats , and cattle .
With the dough they had brought from Egypt , they baked round , flat bread . The dough had not risen because they had been thrown out of Egypt and had no time to prepare food for the trip .
The Israelites had been living in Egypt for four hundred and thirty years .
After exactly four hundred and thirty years all of Jehovah’s people left Egypt in organized family groups .
It is a night to be observed for Jehovah for having brought them out from the land of Egypt . This night is for Jehovah and should be observed by all the sons of Israel throughout their generations .
Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron : » This is the ordinance of the Passover : no foreigner is to eat of it .
» After you have circumcised your purchased slave he may eat of it .
» No foreigner visiting you may eat it . No hired worker may eat it .
» The meal must be eaten inside one house . Never take any of the meat outside the house . Do not break any of the bones .
» The entire community of Israel must celebrate the Passover .
» The uncircumcised man may not eat it . If a foreigner has settled among you and wants to celebrate Passover to honor Jehovah , you must first circumcise all the males of his household . He is then to be treated like a native-born Israelite and may join in the festival .
» The same regulations apply to native-born Israelites and to foreigners who settle among you . «
All the Israelites obeyed . They did what Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron .
On that day Jehovah brought the Israelite tribes out of Egypt .
Jehovah said to Moses :
» Consecrate appoint sanctify all the first-born males to me . Every first-born male Israelite and every first-born male animal belongs to me ! «
Moses said to the people : » Remember this day in the month of Abib . It is the day Jehovah’s mighty power rescued you from slavery in Egypt . Do not eat anything made with yeast .
» You are going out this day in the month Abib .
» Jehovah shall bring you into the land of the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites . He swore to your fathers to give you this land flowing with milk and honey . You shall observe this rite in this month .
» You must eat unleavened bread seven days . The seventh day will be a feast to Jehovah .
» Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days . No leavened bread shall be seen with you or in all your borders .
» On that day tell your children : ‘ We do this because of what Jehovah did for us when we left Egypt . ’ «
» This festival will be like a mark on your hand . It will be a reminder on your forehead that the teachings of Jehovah are always to be a part of your conversation ! Jehovah used his mighty hand to bring you out of Egypt .
» You must follow these rules every year at this time .
» When Jehovah brings you to the land of the Canaanites and gives it to you , as he swore to you and your ancestors ,
sacrifice every firstborn male offspring to Jehovah . The firstborn male offspring of each of your animals belongs to Jehovah .
» It will cost you a sheep or a goat to buy any firstborn donkey back from Jehovah . You must break the donkey’s neck if you do not buy it back . You must also buy every firstborn son back from Jehovah .
» In the future when your children ask you , ‘ What does this mean ? ’ ’ tell them : ‘ Jehovah used his mighty hand to bring us out of slavery in Egypt . ’ ’ «
» Pharaoh was too stubborn to let us go . Because of this every firstborn male in Egypt-human and animal was killed . This is why we sacrifice every firstborn male to Jehovah and buy every firstborn son back from Jehovah .
» This festival will be like a mark on your hand and like a band on your forehead , because Jehovah used his mighty hand to bring us out of Egypt . «
» When the king of Egypt let the people go God did not take them on the road that goes up the coast to Philistia , although it was the shortest way . God thought : I do not want the people to change their minds and return to Egypt when they see that they are going to have to fight . «
He led them by way of the desert by the Red Sea . The Israelites were armed for battle .
Moses took the body of Joseph with him . Joseph made the Israelites solemnly promise to do so . Joseph said : When God rescues you , you must carry my body with you from this place .
The Israelites left Sukkoth and camped at Etham on the edge of the desert .
Jehovah went in front of them in a pillar of cloud to show them the way during the day . He went in front of them in a pillar of fire to give them light , so that they could travel at night .
The pillar of cloud was always in front of the people during the day , and the pillar of fire at night .
Jehovah said to Moses :
» Tell the Israelites to turn back and camp in front of Pi Hahiroth , between Migdol and the Red Sea , near Baal Zephon .
» The king will think that the Israelites are wandering around in the country and are closed in by the desert .
» I will make him stubborn . He will pursue you . My victory over the king and his army will bring me honor . Then the Egyptians will know that I am Jehovah ! « The Israelites did as they were told .
The king of Egypt was told that the people had escaped . He and his officials changed their minds and said : » What have we done ? We have let the Israelites escape , and we have lost them as our slaves ! «
The king got his war chariot and army ready .
He commanded his officers in charge of his six hundred best chariots and all his other chariots to start after the Israelites .
Jehovah made the king so stubborn that he went after them . The Israelites proudly went on their way .
The king’s horses and chariots and soldiers caught up with them while they were camping by the Red Sea near Pi-Hahiroth and Baal-Zephon .
The Israelites saw the king coming with his army . They were frightened and begged Jehovah for help .
They also complained to Moses : Was there not enough room in Egypt to bury us ? Is that why you brought us out here to die in the desert ? Why did you bring us out of Egypt ?
» Did we not say in Egypt : Leave us alone that we may serve the Egyptians ? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert . «
But Moses said to the people : » Do not fear ! Stand by and see the salvation of Jehovah . He will accomplish this for you today . The Egyptians whom you have seen today , you will never see them again forever .
» Jehovah will fight for you while you keep silent . «
Jehovah said to Moses : » Why are you crying out to me ? Tell the sons of Israel to go forward .
» As for you , lift up your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it . The sons of Israel shall go through the midst of the sea on dry land .
» I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them . I will be honored through Pharaoh and all his army , through his chariots and his horsemen .
» Then the Egyptians will know that I am Jehovah , when I am honored through Pharaoh , through his chariots and his horsemen . «
The angel of God , who had been going before the camp of Israel , moved and went behind them . The pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them .
So it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel . There was the cloud along with the darkness , yet it gave light at night . Thus the one did not come near the other all night .
Moses stretched out his hand over the sea . Jehovah swept the sea back by a strong east wind all night and turned the sea into dry land . The waters were divided .
The Israelites went through the middle of the sea on dry ground . The water stood like a wall on their right and on their left .
The Egyptians pursued them . Pharaoh’s horses , chariots , and cavalry followed them into the sea .
Just before dawn , Jehovah looked down from the column of fire and smoke and threw the Egyptian camp into a panic .
He made the wheels of their chariots come off . They could hardly move . Then the Egyptians shouted : » Let us get out of here ! Jehovah is fighting for Israel ! He is against us ! «
Jehovah then said to Moses : » Hold out your hand over the sea , and the water will flow back over the Egyptians and their chariots and drivers . «
Moses held out his hand over the sea . At daybreak the water returned to its normal level . The Egyptians tried to escape from the water . But Jehovah threw them into the sea .
The water returned and covered the chariots , the drivers , and all the Egyptian army that had followed the Israelites into the sea . None of them were left .
On the other hand , the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground , with walls of water on both sides .
That day Jehovah saved the people of Israel from the Egyptians . The Israelites saw them lying dead on the seashore .
The Israelites saw the great power with which Jehovah had defeated the Egyptians . So they stood in awe of Jehovah . They had faith in Jehovah and in his servant Moses .
Moses and the Israelites sang this song to Jehovah : » I will sing to Jehovah , because he has won a glorious victory . He has thrown the horses and their riders into the sea .
» Jehovah is my strong defender . He is the one who has saved me . He is my God , and I will praise him , my father’s God , and I will sing about his greatness .
» Jehovah is His name , and he is a warrior !
» He threw the chariots and army of Egypt’s king into the Red Sea , and he drowned the best of the king’s army .
» The depths have covered them . They sank to the bottom just like boulders .
» With the tremendous force of your right arm , Jehovah , you crushed your enemies .
» In the greatness of your excellence you overthrow those who rose up against you . You sent your wrath and consumed them like stubble .
» With a blast from your nostrils , the water piled up . The waves stood up like a dam . The deep water thickened in the middle of the sea .
» The enemy said : ‘ I will pursue them ! I will catch them ! I will divide the loot ! I will take all I want ! I will use my sword ! I will take all they have ! ’ «
» Your breath blew the sea over them . They sank like lead in the raging water .
» Who among the gods is like you Jehovah ? Who is like you , wonderful in holiness ? Who can work wonders and mighty acts like yours ?
» You stretched out your right hand , and the earth swallowed our enemies .
» Using your powerful love , you rescued redeemed the people .
» Nations learned of this and trembled . The Philistines shook with horror .
» The sheiks chiefs of Edom were dismayed . The leaders of Moab are griped with fear . The inhabitants of Canaan are filled with fear .
» Terror and dread fall upon them . By the greatness of your arm they are motionless as stone . Until your people pass over , O Jehovah , until the people pass over whom you have purchased .
» You will bring them and plant them on your own mountain , the place where you live , O Jehovah , the holy place that you built with your own hands , O Jehovah .
» Jehovah will rule as king forever and ever . «
When Pharaoh’s horses , chariots , and cavalry went into the sea , Jehovah made the water of the sea flow back over them . The Israelites had gone through the sea on dry ground .
The prophet Miriam , Aaron’s sister , took a tambourine in her hand . All the women , danced with tambourines , and followed her .
Miriam sang to them : » Sing to Jehovah . He has won a glorious victory . He has thrown horses and their riders into the sea . «
Moses led Israel away from the Red Sea into the desert of Shur . For three days they traveled in the desert without finding water .
When they came to Marah , they could not drink the water because it tasted bitter . That is why the place was called Marah Bitter Place .
The people complained about Moses . They asked : » What can we drink ? «
Moses cried out to Jehovah . Jehovah showed him a piece of wood . He threw it into the water , and the water became sweet . Jehovah presented laws and rules for them to live by . He tested them there .
He said : » If you will listen carefully to Jehovah your God and do what he considers right , if you pay attention to his commands and obey all his laws , I will never make you suffer any of the diseases I made the Egyptians suffer . I am Jehovah , who heals you . «
Then they went to Elim . There were twelve springs and seventy palm trees . They camped there by the water .
The whole congregation of Israelites moved from Elim to the desert of Sin , which is between Elim and Sinai . This was on the fifteenth day of the second month after they left Egypt .
The entire congregation complained about Moses and Aaron in the desert .
The Israelites said to them : » If only Jehovah had allowed us die in Egypt ! There we sat by our pots of meat and ate all the food we wanted ! You brought us out into this desert to let us all starve to death ! «
Jehovah said to Moses : » I am going to cause food to rain down from the sky for all of you . The people must go out every day and gather enough for that day . In this way I can test them to find out if they will follow my instructions .
» They are to bring in twice as much as usual and prepare it on the sixth day . «
Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites : » This evening you will know that it was Jehovah who brought you out of Egypt .
» In the morning you will see the glory of Jehovah’s presence . He hears your complaints against him . But what are we that you complain against us ? «
Moses said : » This will happen when Jehovah gives you meat to eat in the evening , and bread to eat in the morning . Jehovah hears your complaints against him . And what are we ? Your complaints are not against us but against Jehovah . «
Moses said to Aaron : » Say to all the congregation of the sons of Israel : ‘ Come near before Jehovah for he has heard your complaints . ’ «
Aaron was speaking to them , when everyone looked out toward the desert and saw the bright glory of Jehovah in a cloud .
Jehovah said to Moses :
» I have heard my people complain . I said to them : ‘ Each evening you will have meat and each morning they will have more than enough bread . ’ ’ Then you will know that I am Jehovah their God . ’ «
That evening many quails came and landed everywhere in the camp , and the next morning dew covered the ground .
After the dew had gone , the desert was covered with thin flakes that looked like frost .
When the children of Israel saw , they said to one another : » What is this ? « For they did not know what it was . Moses said to them : » This is the bread Jehovah has given you to eat . «
This is what Jehovah has commanded : » Each man should gather according to what he can eat . You shall take two quarts for each person in your tent . «
The sons of Israel did this . Some gathered much and some little .
They measured it . Those who gathered much did not have too much . Some who gathered less did not have too little . Each had gathered just what he needed .
Moses said : » No one is to keep any of it for tomorrow . «
Some of them did not listen to Moses and saved part of it . The next morning it was full of worms and smelled rotten . Moses was angry with them .
Every morning each one gathered as much as he needed . When the sun grew hot , what was left on the ground melted .
The sixth day they gathered twice as much food , four quarts for each person . All the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses about it .
Moses said : » Jehovah has commanded that tomorrow is a holy day of rest , dedicated to God . Bake today what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil . Whatever is left should be put aside and kept for tomorrow . «
They kept what was left until the next day as Moses commanded . It did not spoil or get worms in it .
Moses said : » Eat this today , because today is the Sabbath , a day of rest dedicated to Jehovah . You will not find any food outside the camp .
» You shall gather it for six days . But on the seventh day , the Sabbath , there shall be none . «
Some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather . They did not find any .
Jehovah spoke to Moses : » How long do you refuse to keep my commandments and my instructions ?
» Jehovah has given you the Sabbath . He gives you bread for two days on the sixth day . Remain every man in his place ! Let no man go out of his place on the seventh day . «
So the people rested on the seventh day .
The house of Israel called its name manna . It was like coriander seed , white in color . It tasted like wafers made with honey .
Moses said : » This is what Jehovah has commanded : ‘ Let two quarts of it be kept throughout your generations . Then they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness , when I brought you out of the land of Egypt . ’ «
Moses said to Aaron : » Take a jar , and put two quarts of manna in it . Place it before Jehovah , to be kept throughout your generations . «
Aaron placed it before the Testimony , to be kept just as Jehovah commanded Moses .
The children of Israel ate the manna forty years , until they came to an inhabited land . They ate the manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan .
The standard dry measure used in Moses’ day equaled twenty quarts .
The entire congregation of Israelites left the desert of Sin and traveled from place to place as Jehovah commanded them . They camped at Rephidim , but there was no water for the people to drink .
So they complained to Moses about this : » Give us water to drink ! « Moses said : » Why do you complain to me ? Why do you test Jehovah ? «
The people were thirsty for water . They complained to Moses and asked : » Why did you bring us out of Egypt ? Was it to make us , our children , and our livestock die of thirst ? «
Moses cried out to Jehovah : » What should I do with these people ? They are almost ready to stone me ! «
Jehovah said to Moses : » Go in front of the people . Take the elders of Israel with you . Take your rod with which you struck the river , in your hand , and go .
» Behold ! I will stand before you there upon the rock in Horeb . Strike the rock and water will come out of it . Then the people may drink . « Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel .
He called the name of the place Massah , and Meribah , because of the complaining of the children of Israel , and because they tested Jehovah , saying : » Is Jehovah among us or not ? «
The Amalekites fought Israel at Rephidim .
Moses said to Joshua : » Choose some of our men . Then fight the Amalekites . Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill . I will hold in my hand the staff God told me to take along . «
Joshua did as Moses told him . They fought the Amalekites , while Moses , Aaron , and Hur went to the top of the hill .
As long as Moses held up his hands , Israel would win , but as soon as he put his hands down , the Amalekites would start to win .
Finally , Moses was so tired that Aaron and Hur got a rock for him to sit on . They stood beside him and supported his arms in the same position until sunset .
That is how Joshua defeated the Amalekites .
After the fight Jehovah said to Moses : » Write an account of this victory and read it to Joshua . I want the Amalekites to be forgotten forever . «
Moses built an altar . He named it : » Jehovah Gives Me Victory . «
Then Moses explained : » This is because I depended on Jehovah . But in future generations , Jehovah will have to fight the Amalekites again . «
Jethro was the priest of Midian and the father-in-law of Moses . He heard what Jehovah God had done for Moses and his people , after rescuing them from Egypt .
Moses sent his wife Zipporah and her two sons to stay with Jethro . Jethro welcomed them .
Moses was still a foreigner in Midian when his first son was born . Moses said : » I will name him Gershom . «
When his second son was born , Moses said : » I will name him Eliezer , because the God my father worshiped has saved me from the king of Egypt . «
Jethro , Moses’ father-in-law brought Moses’ sons and wife to Moses in the desert . He was camped near the mountain of God .
Jethro sent word to Moses : » I am coming to visit you . I am bringing your wife and her two sons . «
Moses went out to meet his father-in-law . Moses bowed with his face touching the ground and kissed Jethro . They asked each other how they were . Then they entered the tent .
Moses told his father-in-law everything Jehovah had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel . He talked about all the hardships they had on the way , and how Jehovah saved them .
Jethro rejoiced over all the goodness Jehovah had done to Israel , in delivering them from the hand of the Egyptians .
Jethro said : » Blessed be Jehovah who delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of Pharaoh . He delivered the people from under the domination of the Egyptians .
» Now I know that Jehovah is greater than all the other gods . It was proven when they treated the people with contempt . «
Jethro , Moses’ father-in-law , took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God , and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat a meal with Moses’ father-in-law before God .
The next day Moses settled disputes among the people . He was busy from morning till night .
Jethro saw everything that Moses had to do . He asked : » What is all this that you are doing for the people ? Why are you doing this all alone ? There are people standing here from morning till night to consult you ? «
Moses answered : » They come here to find out what God wants them to do .
» They bring their complaints to me . I make decisions on the basis of God’s laws . «
Jethro replied : » That is not a good way to do it .
» You and your people will wear yourselves out . This is too much work for you . You cannot do it alone !
» Listen to the advice I give you . May God be with you ! You must be the people’s representative to God and bring their disagreements to him .
» You must instruct them in the laws and the teachings . Show them how to live and tell them what to do .
» You should choose capable men from all the people . Find men who respect God . These must be men you can trust who hate corruption . Put them in charge of groups of thousands , hundreds , fifties and tens .
» They must be the ones who usually settle disagreements among the people . They should bring all-important cases to you . But they should settle all minor cases themselves . Make it easier for yourself by letting them help you .
» If you do this , as God commands , you will not wear yourself out . All these people can go home with their disputes settled . «
Moses took Jethro’s advice
and chose capable men from among all the Israelites . He appointed them as leaders of thousands , hundreds , fifties , and tens .
They judged the people on a permanent basis . The difficult cases were taken to Moses but they decided the smaller disputes themselves .
Moses said good-bye to Jethro , and Jethro went back home .
The Israelites arrived at the desert of Sinai in the third month after they left the land of Egypt .
They traveled from Rephidim to the desert of Sinai . Israel camped in the wilderness at the foot of Mount Sinai .
Jehovah called Moses from the mountain . So Moses went up the mountain to God . Jehovah told him : » This is what you must say to the descendants of Jacob . Tell the Israelites :
‘ You have seen what I did to Egypt and how I carried you on the wings of eagles and brought you to me .
‘ If you will obey me and are faithful to the terms of my covenant , then out of all the nations you will be my own special possession , for all the earth is mine .
‘ You will be my kingdom of priests and my holy nation . These are the words you must speak to the children of Israel . ’ «
Moses went down the mountain and called for the elders of the people . He repeated to them all the words that Jehovah had commanded him .
All the people answered together : » We will do everything Jehovah has said . « So Moses brought their answer back to Jehovah .
Jehovah said to Moses : » I will come to you in a thick cloud . The people will hear me speaking with you and will believe you from now on . « Moses gave Jehovah the people’s answer .
Jehovah continued : » Go to the people and tell them to spend today and tomorrow purifying themselves for worship . They must wash their clothes .
» They should be ready in three days . I will descend to Mount Sinai , where all of them can see me .
» Warn the people that they are forbidden to touch any part of the mountain . Anyone who touches the mountain will be put to death ,
with stones or arrows , and no one must touch the body of a person killed in this way . Even an animal that touches this mountain must be put to death . You may go up the mountain only after a signal is given on the trumpet . «
Moses went down from the mountain to the people . He consecrated the people , and they washed their garments .
He said to the people : » Get ready for the third day . Do not go near a woman for sexual intercourse . «
On the morning of the third day there were thunder and lightning flashes and a thick cloud upon the mountain . A very loud trumpet sounded . It caused all the people in the camp to tremble .
Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God . They stood at the foot of the mountain .
Mount Sinai was all in smoke because Jehovah descended upon it in fire . Its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace . The whole mountain quaked violently !
The sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder . Moses spoke and God answered him with thunder .
Jehovah descended on the top of Mount Sinai . Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mountain . Moses climbed to the peak of Mount Sinai .
Jehovah spoke to Moses : » Go down and warn the people . They should not break through to gaze at Jehovah . Many of them would perish .
» Let the priests who come near to Jehovah consecrate purify themselves , or else Jehovah will destroy them . «
Moses said to Jehovah : » The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai for you warned us . You said : ‘ Put limits around the mountain and set it apart as holy . ’ «
Jehovah replied to him : » You and Aaron come up to me . But do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to Jehovah , or he will destroy some of them . «
Moses returned to the people and told them .
God spoke all these words :
» I am Jehovah your God , who brought you out of slavery in Egypt .
» Do not have any other god .
» Do not make your own carved idols or statues that represent any creature in the sky , on the earth , or in the water .
» Do not worship them or serve them . I , Jehovah your God , am a God demanding exclusive devotion . I do not tolerate rivals . I will not share your affection with any other god . I punish children for their parents’ sins to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me .
» I show mercy loving kindness to thousands of generations of those who love me and obey my commandments .
» Never use the name of Jehovah your God in a false and evil way . Jehovah will make sure that anyone who is false , evil , careless and vain with his name will be punished .
» Remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy .
» You have six days to do all your work .
» The seventh day is a Sabbath dedicated to Jehovah your God . Do not do any work , you or your son or your daughter , your male or your female servant or your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you .
» Jehovah made the heavens and the earth , the sea and all that is in them in six days . He rested on the seventh day . Therefore Jehovah blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy .
» Honor your father and your mother , that your days may be prolonged in the land Jehovah your God gives you .
» Do not murder .
» Do not commit adultery .
» Do not steal .
» Do not lie accuse anyone falsely .
» Do not covet desire another man’s house . Do not desire his wife , his slaves , his cattle , his donkeys , or anything else that he owns .
The people heard the thunder and the trumpet blast . They saw the lightning and the smoking mountain . They trembled with fear and stood at a distance .
They said to Moses : » If you speak to us , we will listen . However , we are afraid that if God speaks to us , we will die . «
Moses responded : » Do not be afraid . God has only come to test you and to inspire you to obey him , so that you will not sin . «
But the people continued to stand at a distance . Only Moses went near the dark cloud where God was .
Jehovah commanded Moses to tell the Israelites : » You have seen how I have spoken to you from heaven .
» Do not make for yourselves gods of silver or gold to be worshiped in addition to me .
» Make an altar of earth for me . Sacrifice your sheep and your cattle as offerings to be completely burned and as peace offerings . In every place that I set-aside for you to worship me , I will come to you and bless you .
» If you make an altar of stone for me , do not build it out of cut stones . This is because when you use a chisel on stones , you make them unfit for my use .
» Do not build an altar for me with steps leading up to it . If you do , you will expose yourselves as you go up the steps . «
» These are the ordinances you should set before them .
» When you buy a Hebrew slave he will be your slave for six years . In the seventh year he may leave as a free man without paying for his freedom .
» If he was single at the time you bought him he alone must be set free . If he was married at that time , both he and his wife must be given their freedom .
» If his master gives him a wife , and she bears him sons or daughters , the wife and her children will belong to her master . He shall go out alone .
» What if the slave loves his wife and children so much that he will not leave without them ?
» He must stand beside either the door or the doorpost at the place of worship . His owner will punch a small hole through one of his ears with a sharp metal rod . This makes him a slave for life .
» When a man sells his daughter into slavery , she will not go free the way male slaves do .
» If she does not please the master who has chosen her as a wife , he must let her be bought back by one of her close relatives . He has no right to sell her to foreigners , since he has treated her unfairly .
» If a man buys a female slave to give to his son , he should treat her like a daughter .
» If a man takes a second wife , he must continue to give his first wife the same amount of food and clothing and the same rights that she had before .
» If he fails to do any of these things , she should be given her freedom without cost .
» Death is the punishment for murder .
» If you did not intend to kill someone and I , Jehovah , let it happen anyway , you may run for safety to a place that I have set aside .
» If a man schemes and kills a man deliberately remove him from my altar and put him to death .

» Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death .
» When men quarrel and one hits the other with a rock or with his fist and injures him so that he has to stay in bed you must do this .
» If the injured man is able to stand up again and walk around outside with a cane , the one who hit him must not be punished . He must pay the injured man for the loss of his time and for all his medical expenses .
» If a slave owner takes a stick and beats his slave , whether male or female , and the slave dies on the spot , the owner is to be punished .
» If the slave lives a few days after the beating , you are not to be punished . After all , you have already lost the services of that slave who was your property .
» When a pregnant woman suffers a miscarriage as the result of an injury caused by someone who is fighting , if she is not badly hurt , the one who injured her must pay whatever fine her husband demands and the judges approve .
» The payment will be for life if she is seriously injured ,
eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot ,
» burn for burn , wound for wound , bruise for bruise .
» If a man strikes the eye of his male or female slave , and destroys it , he shall let him go free because of his eye .
» If he knocks out a tooth of his male or female slave , he shall let him go free because of his tooth .
» If an ox gores a man or a woman to death , the ox shall surely be stoned and its flesh shall not be eaten ; but the owner of the ox shall go unpunished .
» If an ox was previously in the habit of goring and its owner has been warned , yet he does not confine it and it kills a man or a woman , the ox shall be stoned and its owner also shall be put to death .
» If a ransom is demanded of him , then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatever is demanded of him .
» Whether it gores a son or a daughter , it shall be done to him according to the same rule .
» If the ox gores a male or female slave , the owner shall give his or her master thirty shekels of silver , and the ox shall be stoned .
» If a man opens a pit , or digs a pit and does not cover it over , and an ox or a donkey falls into it ,

» If one man’s ox hurts another’s so that it dies , then they shall sell the live ox and divide its price equally . They should divide the dead ox .
» If it is known that the ox was previously in the habit of goring , yet its owner has not confined it , he shall surely pay ox for ox , and the dead animal shall become his . «
» A man steals an ox or a sheep and slaughters it or sells it . He must pay five oxen for the ox and four sheep for the sheep .
» If the thief is caught while breaking in and is struck so that he dies , there will be no blood guiltiness on his account .
» But if it happens after sunrise , he is guilty of murder . A thief must make up for what he has stolen . If he is unable to do so , he should be sold as a slave to pay for what he stole .
» If the stolen animal is found alive in his possession , whether it is a bull , donkey , or a sheep , he must make up for the loss with double the amount .
» Someone lets his livestock graze in a field or a vineyard . They stray and graze in another person’s field . He must make up for what the damaged field was expected to produce . If he lets them ruin the whole field with their grazing , he must make up from his own field for the loss with the best from his field and vineyard .
» A fire starts and spreads into the underbrush so that it burns up stacked or standing grain or ruins a field . The person who started the fire must make up for the loss .
» Someone gives his neighbor silver or other valuables to keep for him . They are stolen from that person’s house . If the thief is caught , he must make up for the loss with double the amount .

» There is a dispute over the ownership of a bull , a donkey , a sheep , an article of clothing , and any other lost property which two people claim as their own . Both people must bring their case to God . The one whom God declares guilty must make up for his neighbor’s loss with double the amount .
» Someone gives his neighbor a donkey , a bull , a sheep , or any other kind of animal to keep for him , and it dies , is injured , or is captured in war , and there are no witnesses .
» The case between them must be settled by swearing an oath to Jehovah that the neighbor did not take the other person’s animal . The owner must accept the oath . The neighbor does not have to make up for the loss .
» However , if the animal was stolen from the neighbor , he must make up for the owner’s loss .
» If a wild animal killed the neighbor’s animal he must bring in the dead body of the wild animal as evidence . He does not have to make up for an animal that has been killed .
» Whenever someone borrows an animal from his neighbor , and it is injured or dies while the owner is not present , the borrower must make up for the loss .
» If the owner is with the animal , the borrower does not have to make up for the loss . If it is rented , the rental fee covers the loss .

and I will become angry and kill you in war . Your wives will become widows , and your children will be fatherless .
» When you lend money to any of my people who are poor , do not act like a moneylender and require him to pay interest .
» If you take someone’s cloak as a pledge that he will pay you , you must give it back to him before the sunsets ,
for it is the only covering he has to keep him warm . What else can he sleep in ? When he cries out to me for help , I will answer him because I am merciful .

Jehovah said to Moses : » You and Aaron , Nadab , Abihu , and seventy of Israel’s elders come up the mountain to me and worship at a distance .
» Moses alone may come near Jehovah . The others may not . The people must not come along with Moses . «
Moses told the people all Jehovah’s words and legal decisions . Then all the people answered with one voice : » We will do everything Jehovah told us to do . «
Moses wrote down all Jehovah’s words . Early the next morning he built an altar at the foot of the mountain . He erected twelve sacred stones for the twelve tribes of Israel .
Moses sent young men to burn sacrifices to Jehovah . They sacrificed some cattle as peace offerings .

He took the book of the covenant , in which Jehovah’s commandments were written , and read it aloud to the people . They said : » We will obey Jehovah . We will do everything that he has commanded . «
Moses took the blood from the bowls and sprinkled it on the people . Next , he told them : With this blood Jehovah makes his agreement with you .
Moses and Aaron , together with Nadab and Abihu and the seventy leaders , went up the mountain .
They saw the God of Israel . Under his feet was something that looked like a pavement made out of sapphire . It was as bright as the sky .

Jehovah again spoke to Moses :
» When you take a census of the people of Israel , each man is to pay me a price for his life . This to insure that no disaster will come on him while the census is being taken .
» Everyone included in the census must pay the required amount of money . It should be weighed according to the official standard . Everyone must pay this as an offering to me .
» Every man being counted in the census who is twenty years old or older is to pay me this amount .
» The rich man is not to pay more . The poor man is not to pay less , when they pay this amount for their lives .
» Collect this money from the people of Israel and spend it for the upkeep of the tent of meeting . This tax will be the payment for their lives . I will remember to protect them . «
Jehovah said to Moses :
» Make a copper basin with a bronze stand for washing . Put it between the tent of meeting and the altar , and fill it with water .
» Aaron and his sons will use it for washing their hands and feet .
» Before they go into the tent of meeting , they must wash so that they will not die . Before they come near the altar to serve as priests and burn an offering by fire to Jehovah .
« They must wash their hands and feet , so that they will not die . This is a long lasting rule that they and their descendants are to observe . «
Jehovah said to Moses :
» Take top quality spices : twelve pounds of liquid myrrh , six pounds of sweet-smelling cinnamon , six pounds of sweet-smelling cane ,
and twelve pounds of cassia , according to the official standard . Add one gallon of olive oil ,
and make sacred anointing oil , mixed like perfume .
» This is for dedicating the tent and chest ,
the table with its equipment , the lamp stand with its equipment , the incense altar with all its utensils ,
the altar for sacrifices , and the large bowl with its stand .
» You will make them so holy that anyone who even touches them will become holy when you dedicate them this way .
» Sprinkle Aaron and his sons with this oil when you ordain them as my priests .
» Say this to the people of Israel : ‘ This oil must always be used in the ordination service of a priest . It is holy because it is dedicated to Jehovah .
» So treat it as holy ! Do not use it for everyday purposes or mix any for yourselves .
» If you do , you will no longer belong to Jehovah’s people . ’ «
Jehovah said to Moses : » Take one part fragrant spices and two kinds of gum resin and aromatic mollusk shells , and mix them with one part pure frankincense .
» Have a perfumer make it into fragrant incense , seasoned with salt , pure and holy .
» Grind some of it into a fine powder . Put it in front of the ark containing the words of my covenant in the tent of meeting , where I will meet with you . You must treat it as most holy .
» Do not make any incense for yourselves using this formula . Treat it as holy to Jehovah .
» Anyone who prepares anything like it for his own enjoyment must be excluded from his people . «
Jehovah said to Moses :
» I have called Bezalel , son of Uri and grandson of Hur , from the tribe of Judah .
» I filled him with the Spirit of God my power . I gave him understanding , skill , and ability for every kind of artistic work .
» This is for planning skillful designs and working them in gold , silver , and copper .
» It is also for cutting jewels to be set and for carving wood and for every other kind of artistic work .
» I also appointed Oholiab , son of Ahisamach , from the tribe of Dan , to help him . I have given every craftsman the skill necessary to make what I have commanded you :

the table and the dishes , the pure gold lamp stand and all its utensils , the altar for incense ,
the altar for burnt offerings and all its accessories , the basin with its stand ,
the special clothes the holy clothes for the priest Aaron and the clothes for his sons when they serve as priests ,
the anointing oil , and the sweet incense for the holy place . They will make all these things as I commanded you . «
Jehovah also said to Moses :
» Speak to the people of Israel . Say : ‘ You must observe my Sabbaths . This is a sign between you and me throughout your generations that you may know that I am Jehovah , the one who sanctifies you .
» ‘ You are to observe the Sabbath . It is holy to you . Everyone who profanes it will absolutely be put to death . Whoever does any work on it will be removed from his people .
» ‘ Work may be done for six days . The seventh day there is a Sabbath of complete rest . It is holy to Jehovah . Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day will definitely be put to death .
» ‘ The Israelites must observe the Sabbath and celebrate the Sabbath throughout their generations as a long lasting covenant .
» ‘ It is a long lasting sign between the people of Israel and me for the reason that Jehovah made heaven and earth in six days . Then He ceased from work and was refreshed on the seventh day . ’ «
When God finished speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai , He gave him the two tablets of the testimony , tablets of stone , written by the finger of God .
The people saw that Moses delayed coming down from the mountain . They gathered around Aaron . They said to him : » We do not know what has happened to Moses , the man who led us out of Egypt . Make gods to lead us . «
Aaron replied : » Have your wives , sons , and daughters take off the gold earrings they are wearing . Bring them to me . «
The people took off their gold earrings and handed them to Aaron .
After he worked on the gold with a tool , he made it into a statue of a calf . Then they said : » Israel , this is your god , who brought you out of Egypt . «
Aaron built an altar in front of it when he saw what happened . Then he announced : » Tomorrow there will be a festival in Jehovah’s honor . «
Early the next day the people sacrificed burnt offerings and brought peace offerings . After that they sat down to a feast , which turned into an orgy .
Jehovah said to Moses : » Go down there . Your people whom you brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves .
» They have already turned from the way I commanded them to live . They made a statue of a calf for themselves . They have bowed down to it and offered sacrifices to it . They said : » Israel , here is your god who brought you out of Egypt . ’ «
Jehovah added : » I have seen these people . They have an iron sinew stiff necked people are impossible to deal with .
» Now let me alone . Let my anger burn against them . I am so angry with them I am going to destroy them . Then I will make you into a great nation . «
» But Moses pleaded with Jehovah his God . » Jehovah , « he said , » why are you so angry with your people ? These are your people whom you brought out of Egypt using your great power and mighty hand !
» Do not let the Egyptians say : ‘ He was planning all along to kill them in the mountains and wipe them off the face of the earth . That is why he brought them out of our land . ’ ’ Do not be so angry . Reconsider your decision to bring this disaster on your people .
» Remember your servants Abraham , Isaac , and Israel . You took an oath , swearing on yourself . You told them : ‘ I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky . I will give to your descendants all the land I spoke of . It will be their long lasting possession . ’ «
So Jehovah changed his mind and did not bring disaster on his people as he threatened .
Moses went back down the mountain . He carried the two stone tablets with the commandments written on both sides .
God made the tablets and engraved the commandments on them .
Joshua heard the people shouting and said to Moses : » I hear the sound of war in the camp . «
Moses replied : » That does not sound like a shout of victory or a cry of defeat ; it is the sound of singing . «
Moses came close enough to the camp at the foot of the mountain to see the bull-calf and to see the people dancing . He became furious ! He threw down the tablets he was carrying and broke them .
He took the bull-calf that they had made , melted it , ground it into fine powder , and mixed it with water . Then he made the people of Israel drink it .
Moses asked Aaron : » What did these people do to harm you ? Why did you make them sin in this terrible way ? «
Aaron said , » Do not be angry with me . You know the people as well as I do . They are determined to do evil .
» They said to me : ‘ That man Moses led us out of Egypt , but now we do not know what has happened to him . Make us a god to lead us . ’ «
» Then I asked them to bring me their gold earrings . They took them off and gave them to me . I threw the gold into a fire , and out came this bull . «
Moses saw that the people were naked . Aaron had made them naked to their shame among their enemies .
Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said : » Who is on Jehovah’s side ? Come to me . All the sons of Levi came to him . «
He said to them , » Jehovah , the God of Israel says : ‘ Each man put his sword by his side . Go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp . Kill each one his brother , and each one his neighbor , and each one his kindred . ’ «
The sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses . About three thousand men died that day .
Moses said : » Today you are ordained as Jehovah’s . God gave you a blessing today . Each of you fought with your own sons and brothers . «
The next day Moses said to the people : » You have committed a serious sin . Now I will go up the mountain to Jehovah . Maybe I will be able to make a payment for your sin and make atonement with Jehovah for your sin . «
So Moses went back to Jehovah and said : » These people have committed such a serious sin ! They made a god out of gold for themselves .
» Will you forgive their sin ? If not , please wipe me out of the book you have written . «
Jehovah answered Moses : » I will wipe out of my book whoever sins against me .
» Now , go and lead the people to the place I told you about . My angel will go ahead of you . But on the day when I punish , I will punish them for their sin . «
Jehovah killed people because they had Aaron make the calf .
Jehovah said to Moses : » You and the people you brought out of Egypt must leave this place . Go to the land I promised to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob with an oath , saying : ‘ I will give it to your descendants . ’ «
» I will send an angel ahead of you . I will force out the Canaanites , Amorites , Hittites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites .
» Go to that land flowing with milk and honey . I will not be with you , because you are impossible to deal with . I would probably destroy you on the way . «
The people heard this bad news and acted as if someone had died . No one wore any jewelry .
Jehovah said to Moses : » Tell the Israelites : You are impossible to deal with . If I were with you , I might destroy you at any time . Take off your jewelry and I will decide what to do with you . «
The Israelites no longer wore their jewelry after they left Mount Horeb .
Moses used to take a tent and set it up far outside the camp . He called it the tent of meeting . Anyone who was seeking Jehovah’s will used to go outside the camp to the tent of meeting .
Whenever Moses went out to the tent , all the people would rise and stand at the entrances to their tents and watch Moses until he went in .
After Moses entered , the pillar of cloud would come down and stay at the door of the Tent . Jehovah would speak to Moses from the cloud .
The people would bow down as soon they saw the pillar of cloud at the door of the Tent .
Jehovah would speak with Moses in person intimately face to face just as someone speaks with a friend . Moses would then return to the camp . But the young man who was his helper , Joshua son of Nun , stayed in the Tent .
Moses said to Jehovah : » It is true that you have told me to lead these people to that land , but you did not tell me whom you would send with me . You said that you know me well and are pleased with me .
If you are , tell me your plans , so that I may serve you and continue to please you . Remember also that you have chosen this nation to be your own . «
Jehovah replied : » I will go with you and give you peace . «
Moses said : » If you are not going with us , please do not make us leave this place .
» If you do go with us , everyone will know that you are pleased with your people and with me . That way , we will be different from the rest of the people on earth . «
Jehovah said to Moses : » I will do this thing of which you have spoken . You have found favor in my sight . I have known you by name .
Then Moses said : Please show me your glory ! «
Jehovah said : » I will make all my goodness pass in front of you . I will call out my name , JEHOVAH . I will be kind to anyone I want to . I will be merciful to anyone I want to . «
But he said : » You cannot see my face , because no one may see me and live . «
Then Jehovah said : » Look , there is a place near me . Stand by this rocky cliff .
» When my glory passes by , I will put you in a crevice in the cliff and cover you with my hand until I have passed by .
» Then I will take my hand away , and you will see my back , but my face must not be seen . «
Jehovah said to Moses : » Cut two more stone tablets like the first ones . I will write on them the words that were on the first tablets that you smashed .
» Be ready in the morning . Come up on Mount Sinai and present yourself to me there on top of the mountain .
» No man may come with you or even be seen anywhere on the mountain . Even the flocks and herds may not graze in front of this mountain . «
Moses cut two more stone tablets . Early the next morning he carried them up Mount Sinai , just as Jehovah commanded .
Jehovah came down in a cloud and stood with him as Moses called upon the name of Jehovah !
Jehovah then passed in front of him and called out : » I , Jehovah , am a God who is full of compassion and pity . I am not easily angered and show great love and faithfulness .
» I keep my promise for thousands of generations and forgive evil and sin . But I will not fail to punish children and grandchildren to the third and fourth generation for the sins of their fathers . «
Moses hurried to bow low toward the earth and worship .
He prayed : » Jehovah , if you really are pleased with me , I pray that you will go with us . It is true that these people are sinful and rebellious . However , please forgive our sin and let us be your people . «
Jehovah said : » Behold ! I offer a covenant promise to perform signs and miracles for you that have never been done in all the earth . Neighboring nations will stand in fear and know that I was the one who did these marvelous things .
» I will force out the Amorites , the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites . You must do what I command you today .
» Watch yourself that you make no covenant with the inhabitants of the land into which you are going . It will become a snare in your midst .
» Instead tear down their altars and smash their sacred pillars and cut down their Asherim .
» Do not worship any other god but Jehovah for his reputation is filled with zeal , and he is a God who demands exclusive devotion .
Otherwise you might make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land . They would commit spiritual immorality fornication with their gods and sacrifice to their gods . Someone might invite you to eat of his sacrifice .
» You might take some of his daughters for your sons , and his daughters might commit spiritual immorality fornication with their gods and cause your sons also to commit spiritual immorality with their gods .
» Do not make idol gods for yourself .
» Celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread . As I commanded you , you must eat unleavened bread for seven days at the appointed time in the month of Abib . This is because in that month you came out of Egypt .
» Every first male offspring is mine . The firstborn males of all your livestock , whether cattle , sheep , or goats are mine .
» It will cost you a sheep or a goat to buy back the firstborn donkey . If you do not buy it back , then you must break the donkey’s neck . You must buy back every firstborn of your sons . No one may come into my presence without an offering .
» You may work six days . On the seventh day you must not work . Even during the time of plowing or harvesting you must not work on this day .
» Celebrate the Festival of Weeks with the first grain from your wheat harvest . Celebrate the Festival of the Final Harvest at the end of the season .
» Three times a year all your men must come into the presence of the Sovereign Jehovah , the God of Israel .
» I will force nations out of your way and will expand your country’s borders . No one will want to take away your land while you are gone three times a year to Jehovah’s festivals .
» Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to me at the same time you offer anything containing yeast . No part of the sacrifice at the Passover festival should be left over in the morning .
» I am Jehovah your God ! You must bring the first part of your harvest to the place of worship . Do not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk . «
Jehovah told Moses : » Put these laws in writing , as part of my agreement covenant with Israel . «
Moses was there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights . He did not eat bread or drink water . He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant , the Ten Commandments Ten Words .
Moses came down from Mount Sinai . The two tablets of the testimony were in Moses’ hand as he came down from the mountain . Moses did not know that the skin of his face glowed because he spoke with God .
Aaron and all the Israelites looked at Moses and saw his face glowing . They were afraid to come near him .
Moses called to them . Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation came back to him . Then Moses spoke to them .
All the other Israelites came near him . He commanded them to do everything Jehovah told him on Mount Sinai .
Moses put a veil over his face when he finished speaking .
When Moses went into Jehovah’s presence to speak with him , he took off the veil until he came out . When he came out and told the Israelites what he had been commanded ,
they would see that Moses’ face was glowing . Moses would put the veil back on until he went in again to speak with Jehovah .
Moses assembled the whole Israelite congregation and said to them : » These are the things Jehovah commanded you to do :
» You may work for six days . The seventh day is a holy day of worship a Sabbath . It is a day when you do not work . It is dedicated to Jehovah . Whoever does any work on this day should be put to death .
» Do not light a fire in your homes on the Sabbath day . «
Moses spoke to all the people of Israel : » This is what Jehovah has commanded :
‘ Make an offering to Jehovah . Everyone who wishes to do so is to bring an offering of gold , silver , or copper .
‘ The offering could be of fine linen , blue , purple , and red wool ; cloth made of goats’ hair ;
rams’ skin dyed red , fine leather , acacia wood ;
oil for the lamps , spices ; balsam oil for the anointing oil and for the sweet incense .
The offering could also be carnelians and other jewels to be set in the High Priest’s ephod and in his breast piece .
‘ All the skilled workers among you are to come and make everything that Jehovah commanded :
the Tent , its covering and its outer covering , its hooks and its frames , its crossbars , its posts , and its bases ;
the Covenant Box , its poles , its lid , and the curtain to screen it off ;
the table , its poles , and all its equipment ; the bread offered to God ;
the lamp stand for the light and its equipment ; the lamps with their oil ;
the altar for burning incense and its poles ; the anointing oil ; the sweet incense ; the curtain for the entrance of the Tent ;
the altar on which to burn offerings , with its bronze grating attached , its poles , and all its equipment ; the washbasin and its base ;
the curtains for the enclosure , its posts and bases ; the curtain for the entrance of the enclosure ;
the Tent pegs and ropes for the Tent and the enclosure ;
and the garments the priests are to wear when they serve in the Holy Place---the sacred clothes for Aaron the priest and for his sons . ’ «
Then the whole congregation of the people of Israel left Moses .
Those who were willing and whose hearts moved them brought their contributions to Jehovah . The gifts were used to construct the tent of meeting , to pay other expenses , and to make the holy clothes .
All willing , men and women alike , brought all kinds of gold jewelry : pins , brooches , earrings , signet rings , and pendants . They offered these gifts of gold to Jehovah .
Those who had violet , purple , or bright red yarn , fine linen , goats’ hair , rams’ skins dyed red , or fine leather brought them .
Those who could give silver or copper brought it as their contribution to Jehovah . Those who had acacia wood that could be used in the construction brought it .
All the skilled women brought fine linen thread and thread of blue , purple , and red wool , which they made .
They also made thread of goats’ hair .
The leaders brought different kinds of jewels to be sewn on the special clothes and the breast piece for the high priest .
And the spice and the oil for the light , and the holy anointing oil and the sweet perfume balsam oil .
The people of Israel , every man and woman whose hearts were willing , gave their offerings freely to Jehovah . This was for the work that Jehovah gave Moses orders to have done .
Then Moses said to the sons of Israel : » Jehovah has called by name Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur of the tribe of Judah .
» He has filled him with the Spirit of God , in wisdom , in understanding and in knowledge and in all craftsmanship .
» He is a master artist familiar with gold , silver , and copper .
» He knows how to cut and set stones and how to work with wood . He is an expert in all trades .
» Jehovah also gave Bezalel and Oholiab , son of Ahisamach , from the tribe of Dan the ability to teach others .
» Jehovah made these men highly skilled in all trades . They can do the work of jewelers , carpenters , and designers . They know how to embroider violet , purple and bright red yarn on fine linen . They know how to weave yarn on a loom . They can do all kinds of trades . They are master artists .
Moses continued speaking : » Bezalel and Oholiab will do the work as Jehovah commanded . They will do this with the help of every other craftsman to whom Jehovah has given the necessary skills and talents . They will know how to do all the work for constructing the holy place . «
Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab and every craftsman to whom Jehovah gave these skills and who was willing to come and do the work .
Moses provided them with all the contributions the Israelites brought for the work of constructing the holy place . Plus , the people still kept bringing him voluntary freewill offerings every morning .
Then the skilled men who were doing the work went
to Moses . They said : » The people are bringing more than is needed for the work Jehovah commanded to be done . «
Moses sent a command throughout the camp , saying : » No one is to make any further contribution for the sacred Tent . « So the people did not bring any more .
What had already been brought was sufficient to finish all the work .
The most skilled men among those doing the work made the Tent of Jehovah’s presence . They made it out of ten pieces of fine linen woven with blue , purple , and red wool and embroidered with figures of winged creatures .
Each curtain was forty-two feet long and six feet wide . They were all the same size .
Five of the curtains were sewn together . The other five were also sewn together .
They made fifty violet loops along the edge of the end curtain in each set .
They placed the loops opposite sides of each other .
They also made fifty gold fasteners . They used them to link the two sets of curtains together so that the inner tent was a single unit .
Eleven curtains were made of goats’ hair to form an outer tent over the inner tent .
Each of the eleven curtains was forty-five feet long and six feet wide .
Five of the curtains were sewn together into one set , and the remaining six into another set .

There were three branches on each of its two sides , for a total of six branches .

A blossom was placed where each pair of branches came out from the lamp stand .
The lamp stand , including its branches and decorative flowers , was made from a single piece of hammered pure gold .
He made seven its seven lamps including the snuffers and fire trays out of pure gold .
The lamp stand and all the utensils were made out of seventy-five pounds of pure gold .

He also made all the equipment for the altar : the pans , the shovels , the bowls , the hooks , and the fire pans . All this equipment was made of copper .
A copper grating was also made . It was placed under the rim of the altar , so that it reached halfway up the altar .
A copper ring was attached beneath the ledge at the four corners to put the poles through .
After that he covered two acacia wood poles with copper and
put them through the rings for carrying the altar , which was shaped like an open box .
He made the laver basin of copper with its base of copper , from the mirrors of the serving women who served at the doorway of the tent of meeting .
He made the courtyard . The south side curtains of the courtyard were fine twisted linen , one hundred and fifty feet long .

This is the inventory of the tent , the Tent of Testimony . An inventory was ordered by Moses and carried out by the Levites under the direction of Ithamar , son of the priest Aaron .
Bezalel , son of Uri and grandson of Hur , from the tribe of Judah , made everything Jehovah commanded Moses .
Bezalel was a jeweler , carpenter , designer , and he knew how to embroider violet , purple , and bright red yarn on fine linen . His assistant was Oholiab , son of Ahisamach , from the tribe of Dan .
All the gold from the offerings presented to Jehovah used in building the holy place weighed over two thousand one hundred and ninety three pounds using the standard weight of the holy place .
The silver collected when the census of the community was taken weighed seven thousand five hundred and forty four pounds using the standard weight of the holy place .
This amounted to one-fifth of an ounce per person , for everyone counted who was at least twenty years old . There were six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty people .
He used seven thousand five hundred pounds of silver to cast the one hundred bases for the holy place and the canopy . That came to seventy-five pounds per base .
Bezalel used forty-four pounds of silver to make the hooks and bands for the posts and the coverings for the tops of the posts .
The offerings presented to Jehovah weighted five thousand three hundred and ten pounds .
He used this to make the bases for the entrance to the tent of meeting , the copper altar with its copper grate and all its accessories ,
the bases all around the courtyard , the bases for the entrance to the courtyard , all the pegs for the tent , and all the pegs for the surrounding courtyard .
From the violet , purple , and bright red yarn they made special clothes worn for official duties in the holy place . They also made the holy clothes for Aaron . They obeyed Jehovah’s instructions to Moses .
The ephod was made out of fine linen yarn and gold , violet , purple , and bright red yarn .
The gold was hammered into thin sheets and cut up . They twisted the gold into threads , which they creatively worked into each strand of the violet , purple , and bright red yarn , and throughout the fine linen .
From this they made two shoulder straps for the ephod and attached them to its sides , so that it could be fastened .
The finely woven belt , made of the same materials , was attached to the ephod so as to form one piece with it . This was as Jehovah had commanded Moses .
They prepared the carnelians and mounted them in gold settings . They were skillfully engraved with the names of the twelve sons of Jacob .
They placed them on the shoulder straps of the ephod to represent the twelve tribes of Israel . Again , this was just as Jehovah commanded Moses .
The breast piece was made of the same materials as the ephod and with similar embroidery .
It was square and folded double , nine inches long and nine inches wide .
They mounted four rows of precious stones on it . Ruby was mounted on the first row along with topaz , and garnet .
Included in the second row was an emerald , a sapphire , and a diamond .
The third row contained a turquoise , an agate , and an amethyst .
The fourth row contained a beryl , a carnelian , and jasper . These were mounted in gold settings .
Each of the twelve stones had engraved on it the name of one of the sons of Jacob , in order to represent the twelve tribes of Israel .
They made chains out of pure gold , twisted like ropes . These were for the breastplate .
Two gold settings and two gold rings were prepared and attached , the two rings to the top two corners of the breast piece .
They fastened the two gold ropes to the rings at the top corners of the breastplate .
They fastened the other ends of the ropes to the two settings on the shoulder straps of the ephod . The breastplate hung in front of it .
They made two gold rings and fastened them to the other two corners of the breast piece on the inside edge next to the ephod .
They made two more gold rings and fastened them to the bottom of the shoulder straps on the front of the ephod . This was close to the seam just above the belt of the ephod .
Finally they fastened the breast piece by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a violet cord . So the breast piece was attached just above the belt of the ephod and was held in place . They followed Jehovah’s instructions to Moses .
They made the robe that is worn with the ephod . It was woven entirely of violet yarn .
The opening in the center of the robe had a finished edge , somewhat like a leather collar , all around it to keep it from tearing .
On the hem of the robe they made pomegranates of violet , purple , and bright red yarn , and fine yarn .
Bells were made out of pure gold . They were fastened in between the pomegranates all around the hem of the robe .
A gold bell alternated with a pomegranate all around the hem of the robe that is worn by Aaron when he served as priest . They followed Jehovah’s instructions to Moses .
They wove inner robes out of fine linen for Aaron and his sons .
They also made the chief priest’s turban and the other beautiful turbans out of fine linen . They made the undergarments and belt out of fine linen yarn .
The belt was embroidered with violet , purple , and bright red yarn . They followed Jehovah’s instructions to Moses .
The flower-shaped medallion , the holy crown , was fashioned out of pure gold . The statement : HOLY TO JEHOVAH was engraved on it .
They fastened a violet cord to it and tied it on top of the turban . They followed Jehovah’s instructions to Moses .
So all the work on the inner tent of the tent of meeting was now done . The Israelites obeyed all Jehovah’s instructions to Moses .
They brought everything to Moses : the inner tent , the outer tent and all its furnishings , the fasteners , frames , crossbars , posts , sockets ,

The Israelites did all the work according to Jehovah’s instructions to Moses .
Moses inspected all the work . He saw that they had followed Jehovah’s instructions . So Moses blessed them .
Jehovah said to Moses :
» Set up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting on the first day of the first month of the year .
» Place the Ark containing the words of my covenant inside it , and hang the canopy over the ark .

» Place the altar for burning offerings in front of the Tabernacle .
» Set the washbasin between the Tabernacle and the altar and fill it with water .
» Put up the surrounding enclosure and hang the curtain at its entrance .
» Then dedicate the Tabernacle and all its equipment by anointing it with the sacred oil , and it will be holy .
» Dedicate the altar and all its equipment by anointing it , and it will be completely holy .
» Also dedicate the washbasin and its base in the same way .
» Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the Tabernacle , and have them take a ritual bath .
» Dress Aaron in the priestly garments and anoint him . Consecrate him so that he can serve me as priest .
» Bring his sons and put the shirts on them .
» Anoint them just as you anointed their father that they can serve me as priests . This anointing will make them priests for generations to come . «

He put the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing .
Moses , Aaron , and his sons used this water to wash their hands and feet .
They washed whenever they went into the tent of meeting or whenever they approached the altar . Moses obeyed Jehovah’s instructions .
He set up the courtyard around the tent and the altar and put up the screen at the entrance to the courtyard . At last Moses finished the work .
The column of smoke then covered the tent of meeting . The glory of Jehovah filled the tent .
Moses could not go into the tent of meeting because the smoke settled on it and the glory of Jehovah filled the tent .
In all their travels , when the column of smoke moved from the tent , the Israelites would break camp .
But if the column did not move , they would not break camp .
Jehovah’s column of smoke stayed over the tent during the day . There was fire in the smoke at night . This way all the Israelites could see the column throughout their travels .
Jehovah called to Moses . He spoke to him from the Tent of Meeting , He said :
» Tell the Israelites : ‘ When you bring an offering to Jehovah , bring your offering of animals from the herd or the flock .
» ‘ If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd , it should be a male without defect . He shall offer it at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting , that he may be accepted before Jehovah .
» ‘ He should lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering . It may then be accepted for him to make atonement with Jehovah on his behalf .
» ‘ Slaughter the bull in Jehovah’s presence . Aaron's sons , the priests , will offer the blood . They will throw it against all sides of the altar that is at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting .
» ‘ Skin the burnt offering , and cut it into pieces .
» ‘ The sons of the priest Aaron will start a fire on the altar and lay the wood on the fire .
» ‘ Aaron's sons , the priests , will also lay the pieces , the head , and the fat on top of the wood burning on the altar .
» ‘ Wash the internal organs and legs . The priest will then burn all of it on the altar . It is a burnt offering , an offering by fire , a soothing aroma to Jehovah .
» ‘ Should you are offer one of your sheep or goats ; it must be a male without any defects .
» ‘ Slaughter it on the north side of the altar . The priests should throw its blood on all four sides of the altar .
» ‘ After you cut it up , the officiating priest will lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire .
» ‘ Wash the internal organs and the hind legs . The priest will present the sacrifice to Jehovah and burn all of it on the altar . The odor of this food offering is pleasing to Jehovah .
» ‘ If you are offering a bird as a burnt offering , it must be a dove or a pigeon .
» ‘ A priest will take the bird to the copper altar . He will wring its neck and put its head on the fire . Then he will drain out its blood on one side of the altar ,
» ‘ Remove the bird's crop with its feathers , and throw them on the ash heap at the east side of the altar .
» ‘ Finally , he will take the bird by its wings , tear it partially open , and send it up in smoke with a smell that pleases Jehovah .
» ‘ When you present an offering of grain to Jehovah , you must first grind it into flour . You must put oil and incense on it .
» ‘ Give it to Aaron’s sons the priests . The priest will take a handful of the flour and oil and all of the incense and burn it on the altar as a memorial . It is all offered by fire to Jehovah . The odor of this food offering is pleasing to Jehovah .
» ‘ The rest of the grain offering will belong to Aaron and his sons . It is most holy and set apart from Jehovah’s offering by fire .
» ‘ If your grain offering has been baked in an oven , it must be rings of unleavened bread made of flour mixed with olive oil or wafers of unleavened bread brushed with oil .
» ‘ If your grain offering is prepared in a frying pan , it , too , will be unleavened bread made of flour mixed with oil .
» ‘ Break it into pieces and pour oil over it . It is a grain offering .
» ‘ When your grain offering is prepared in a skillet , it will be made of flour with oil .
» ‘ Bring Jehovah the grain offering prepared in any of these ways . Offer it to the priest who will bring it to the altar .
» ‘ To show that the whole offering belongs to me , the priest will lay part of it on the altar . He will send it up in smoke and fire with a smell that pleases Jehovah .
» ‘ The rest of the offering belongs to the priests . It is very holy , since it is taken from the food offered to Jehovah .
» ‘ Every grain offering you bring to Jehovah must be made without yeast . Do not use yeast or honey in food offered to Jehovah .
» ‘ Bring them to Jehovah as an offering of first fruits . Do not offer them on the altar as a soothing aroma .
» ‘ Season every grain offering with salt . Do not leave the salt of the covenant of your God out of your grain offering . All of your offerings must have salt .
» ‘ When you bring a grain offering of early-ripened things to Jehovah , you should bring fresh heads of grain roasted in the fire , grits of new growth , for the grain offering of your early-ripened things .
» ‘ Put oil and incense on it . It is a grain offering .
» ‘ The priest will burn the flour , oil , and all the incense as a reminder . It is an offering by fire to Jehovah .
» ‘ If your sacrifice is a fellowship offering of cattle in Jehovah’s presence , it must be a male or female animal that has no defects .
» ‘ Put your hand on the head of the animal and kill it at the entrance of the Tent of Jehovah’s presence . Then Aaron’s sons the priests must throw the blood against all four sides of the altar .
» ‘ Offer all of the fat on the animal's insides as a sacrifice of the peace offering made by fire to Jehovah .
» ‘ Also use the lower part of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat .
» ‘ Some of the priests will lay these pieces on the altar and send them up in smoke with a smell that pleases me , together with the sacrifice that is offered to Jehovah .
» ‘ If your sacrifice is a fellowship offering of sheep to Jehovah , you must bring a male or female animal that has no defects .

» ‘ Take the fat from the fellowship offering and offer it by fire to Jehovah . Remove all the fat from the tail and the fat that covers the internal organs .
» ‘ Remove the two kidneys with the fat on them along with the lobe of the liver .
» ‘ The priest must burn the offering on the altar . It is food , an offering by fire to Jehovah .
» ‘ When you offer a goat , offer it before Jehovah .
» ‘ Put your hand on its head and slaughter it in front of the Tent . The priests will throw its blood against all four sides of the altar .
» ‘ Offer all of the fat on the animal's insides .
» ‘ Also the two kidneys with the fat that is on them , which is on the loins , and the lobe of the liver , which he will remove with the kidneys .
» ‘ The priest will burn them on the altar . It is food , an offering by fire to Jehovah . It is a soothing aroma . All the fat belongs to Jehovah .
» ‘ This is a long lasting law for generations to come wherever you live . Never eat any fat or blood . ’ «
Jehovah commanded Moses
to tell the people of Israel : » If a person sins unintentionally and does not keep Jehovah’s commandments he would have to observe the following rules :
» If it is the High Priest who sins and brings guilt on the people , he should present a young bull without any defects and sacrifice it to Jehovah for his sin .
» The priest must lead the bull to the entrance of the sacred tent . He must lay his hand on its head and kill it there .
» He will take a bowl of the blood inside the tent ,
dip a finger in the blood , and sprinkle some of it seven times toward the sacred chest behind the curtain .
» In my presence , he will smear some of the blood on each of the four corners of the incense altar , before pouring out the rest at the foot of the copper altar near the entrance to the tent .
» He must remove from it all the fat of the bull of the sin offering : the fat that covers the entrails , and all the fat which is on the entrails ,
and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them , which is on the loins , and the lobe of the liver , which he shall remove with the kidneys
» It is to be removed from the bull of the sacrifice of peace offerings . The priest is to offer them up in smoke on the altar of burnt offering .
» But the hide of the bull and all its flesh with its head and its legs and its entrails and its refuse ,
» He is to bring the rest of the bull to a clean place outside the camp where the ashes are poured out . There he will burn it on wood with fire ; where the ashes are poured out it shall be burned .
» If the whole congregation of Israel commits error and the matter escapes the notice of the assembly , and they commit any of the things that Jehovah commands not to be done they become guilty .
» When the sin they have committed becomes known the assembly shall offer a bull of the herd . This is for a sin offering . Bring it before the Tent of Meeting .
» The elders of the congregation will place their hands on the bull's head in Jehovah’s presence . One of them will slaughter it in Jehovah’s presence .
» Then the anointed priest will bring some of the bull's blood into the Tent of Meeting .
» The priest will dip his finger in some of the blood and sprinkle it seven times in Jehovah’s presence in front of the veil .
» He will put some blood on the horns of the altar in Jehovah’s presence in the Tent of Meeting . He will pour the remaining blood at the bottom of the altar . This is for burnt offerings at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting .
» He will remove all the fat and burn it on the altar .
» He will do the same thing with this bull that he did with the bull used as the offering for sin . So the priest will pay compensation for the wrong and make peace with Jehovah for the people . They will be forgiven .
» He will take the bull outside the camp and burn it the same way he burned the first bull . It is an offering for sin for the community .
» When a ruler sins and becomes guilty of breaking one of Jehovah’s commands without intending to ,
as soon as the sin is called to his attention , the priest will bring as his offering a male goat without any defects .
» He will place his hand on the goat's head . He will slaughter it in Jehovah’s presence where he slaughters animals for burnt offerings . It is an offering for sin .
» The priest will then take some of the blood of the offering for sin with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar for burnt offerings . He will pour the rest of the blood at the bottom of the altar for burnt offerings .
» He will burn all the fat on the altar the same way the fat of the fellowship offering is burned . The priest will pay compensation for the wrong and make peace for what the leader did wrong . The leader will be forgiven .
» When a common person unintentionally does something wrong , even one thing forbidden by Jehovah’s commandments , he will be guilty .
» When he learns what he has done wrong , he must bring a female goat that has no defects as his offering for what he has done wrong .
» He will place his hand on the animal's head and slaughter it where animals for burnt offerings are slaughtered .
» The priest will take some of the blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar for burnt offerings . He will pour the rest of the blood out at the bottom of the altar .
» He will remove all the fat the same way it is removed from the peace offering . The priest will burn it on the altar for a soothing aroma to Jehovah . So the priest will make peace with Jehovah for that person . That person will be forgiven .
» If someone brings a lamb as his offering for sin , he must bring a female that has no defects .
» He will place his hand on the animal's head and slaughter it where he slaughters animals for burnt offerings .
» Then the priest will take some of the blood from the offering for sin with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar for burnt offerings . He will pour the rest of the blood at the bottom of the altar .
» He will remove all the fat the same way the fat of the lamb is removed from the peace offerings . Then the priest will burn it on the altar with the offering by fire to Jehovah . Then the priest will pay compensation for the wrong and make peace with Jehovah for what that person did wrong . That person will be forgiven .
Jehovah continued : » If you are a witness under oath who refuses to tell what you saw or what you know , you are sinning and will be punished .
» If you touch anything unclean such as an unclean dead body of a wild or tame animal or the body of an unclean , swarming creature and then ignore what you did , you are unclean and will be guilty .
» If you become unclean by touching human uncleanness of any kind and then ignore it knowing what you did you will be guilty .
» When you pledge a vow in haste about what you will or will not do , as some people do , and then ignore it ; although you know what you said , you will be guilty .
» So if you are guilty of any of these sins , you must confess it .
» Bring your guilt offering to Jehovah for the sin you committed . It must be a female sheep or goat as an offering for sin . Then the priest will pay compensation for the wrong and make peace with Jehovah for what you did wrong .
» If you cannot afford a sheep , you must bring two turtledoves or two pigeons to Jehovah as a guilt offering for the sin you committed . One will be an offering for sin . The other will be a burnt offering .
» Bring them to the priest . He will sacrifice the offering for sin first . He will break the bird's neck without pulling its head off .
» He will sprinkle some of the blood from the offering for sin on the side of the altar . The rest of the blood will be drained at the bottom of the altar . It is an offering for sin .
» Following the proper procedures he will sacrifice the second bird as a burnt offering . The priest will pay compensation and make peace with Jehovah for what you did wrong .
» If you cannot afford two turtledoves or two pigeons , bring eight cups of flour as an offering for the sin you committed . Never put olive oil on it or add incense to it . This is because it is an offering for sin .
» Bring it to the priest . The priest will take a handful of it . He will burn it as a reminder on top of the offering by fire to Jehovah on the altar . It is an offering for sin .
» The priest will pay compensation and make peace with Jehovah for your sin what you did wrong . You will be forgiven . The offering will belong to the priest like the grain offering . «
Jehovah spoke to Moses :
» If any of you fail to do your duty by unintentionally doing something wrong with any of Jehovah’s holy things , bring a guilt offering to Jehovah . It must be a ram that has no defects or its value in silver weighed according to the official standards of the holy place .
» You must make the payments you have failed to hand over and must pay an additional twenty percent . Give it to the priest . The priest will offer the animal as a sacrifice for your sin . You will be forgiven .
» If any of you sin unintentionally by breaking any of Jehovah’s commandments , you are guilty and must pay the penalty .
» Bring to the priest as a repayment offering a male sheep or goat without any defects . Its value is to be determined according to the official standard . The priest shall offer the sacrifice for the sin that you committed unintentionally . You will be forgiven .
» It is a repayment offering for the sin you committed against Jehovah . «
Jehovah gave the following regulations to Moses :
» If any of you sin against Jehovah by failing to do your duty , if you lie to your neighbor about something you were supposed to take care of or if you lie about something stolen or seized from your neighbor , you are sinning and will be guilty .
» If you find something that someone lost and lie about it under oath , or commit any other sin like this ,
you have sinned and are guilty . Return what you stole or seized , what you were supposed to take care of , the lost item you found ,
or whatever it was that you swore falsely about . Pay it back in full plus one-fifth more . Give it back to its owner on the day you bring your guilt offering .
» Then bring your guilt offering to Jehovah . Bring a ram that has no defects or its value in money . Bring it to the priest .
» The priest will pay compensation for your wrong and make peace with Jehovah . Then you will be forgiven for whatever you did that made you guilty . «
Jehovah continued to speak to Moses ,
» Command Aaron and his sons : ‘ These are the instructions for the burnt offering that stays on the altar overnight while the altar fire is kept burning .
» ‘ The priest must put on his linen clothes . This includes linen undergarments . Then he will remove the ashes left on the altar from the fire that consumed the burnt offering and will put them next to the altar .
» ‘ He will take off these clothes and put on some others . He will take the ashes to a clean place outside the camp .
» ‘ The fire must always be burning on the altar . It must never go out . The priest will burn wood on it every morning . He will lay the burnt offering on the fire and burn the fat of the fellowship offering .
» ‘ The fire must always be burning on the altar . It must never go out .
» ‘ This is the law of the grain offering : the sons of Aaron shall present it in the presence of Jehovah in front of the altar .
» ‘ One of them will lift up from it a handful of the fine flour of the grain offering . Using its oil and all the incense that is on the grain offering , and he will offer it up in smoke on the altar . It will be a soothing aroma and a memorial offering to Jehovah .
» ‘ Any thing left is for Aaron and his sons to eat . It will be eaten as unleavened cakes in a holy place . They must eat it in the court of the Tent of Meeting .
» ‘ It shall not be baked with leaven . I have given it as their share from my offerings by fire . It is most holy , like the sin offering and the guilt offering .
» ‘ Every male among the sons of Aaron may eat it . It is a long lasting ordinance throughout your generations , from the offerings by fire to Jehovah . Whoever touches them will become consecrated . ’ «
Jehovah continued to speak to Moses :
» This is the offering Aaron and his sons are to present to Jehovah on the day when he is anointed : a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a regular grain offering , half of it in the morning and half of it in the evening .
» Prepare it with oil on a griddle . Stir it well and bring it . Present the grain offering in baked pieces as a soothing aroma to Jehovah .
» The anointed priest who will be in his place among his sons will offer it . By a long lasting ordinance it shall be entirely offered up in smoke to Jehovah .
» Every grain offering made by a priest must be completely burned . It must not be eaten . «
Jehovah spoke to Moses :
» Tell Aaron and his sons : ‘ These are the instructions for the offering for sin . The offering for sin must be slaughtered in Jehovah’s presence . It is very holy .
» ‘ The priest who makes the offering for sin will eat it in a holy place , in the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting . This is in the same place where the burnt offering is slaughtered .
» ‘ Everything that touches its meat will be holy . If blood gets on someone's clothes , he must wash them in a holy place .

» ‘ These are the instructions for the guilt offering . It is very holy .
» ‘ It should be slaughtered in the same place where the burnt offering is slaughtered . A priest will throw the blood against all sides of the altar .
» ‘ He will offer all the fat , the fat from the tail , the fat covering the internal organs .
» ‘ That includes the two kidneys with the fat on them . He will also remove the lobe of the liver along with the kidneys .
The priest will burn them on the altar . It is a guilt offering by fire to Jehovah .
» ‘ Every male among the priests may eat it . It will be eaten in a holy place . It is very holy .
» ‘ The same instructions apply to the offering for sin and the guilt offering . Both offerings belong to the priest to pay compensation for wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah .
» ‘ The skin of the burnt offering belongs to the priest who sacrifices it .
» ‘ Every grain offering , whether baked in an oven or prepared in a skillet or a frying pan , belongs to the priest who offers it .
» ‘ Every grain offering , whether mixed with olive oil or dry , will be shared equally by all of Aaron's sons .
» ‘ These are the instructions for the fellowship offering that you must bring to Jehovah .
» ‘ If you offer it as a thank offering , you must also bring rings of unleavened bread mixed with oil , wafers of unleavened bread brushed with oil , and loaves made from flour mixed well with oil .
» ‘ In addition to these rings of bread , you must bring leavened bread with yeast along with your fellowship offering of thanksgiving .
» ‘ He will present one of every offering as a contribution to Jehovah . It will belong to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings .
» ‘ The flesh of the sacrifice of his thanksgiving peace offerings will be eaten on the day of his offering . He should not leave any of it over until morning .
» ‘ If the sacrifice of his offering is a votive or a freewill offering , it shall be eaten on the day that he offers his sacrifice as well as on the next day .
» ‘ Anything left over from the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned .
» ‘ If any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings is eaten on the third day , he who offers it will not be accepted . It will not be considered for his benefit . It will be an offensive thing , and the person who eats of it will bear his own iniquity .
» ‘ The flesh that touches anything unclean shall not be eaten . It should be burned with fire . As for other flesh , anyone who is clean may eat such flesh .
» ‘ The person who eats the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings that belong to Jehovah , in his uncleanness , that person will be cut off from his people .
» ‘ When someone touches anything unclean , whether human uncleanness , or an unclean animal , or any unclean detestable thing , and eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings which belong to Jehovah , that person shall be cut off from his people . ’ «
Jehovah continued to speak to Moses :
» Tell the Israelites : ‘ Never eat any fat from bulls , sheep , or goats .
» ‘ The fat from an animal that dies naturally or is killed by wild animals you may use for any other purpose . However , you must not eat it .
» ‘ Those who eat the fat from an animal they sacrificed by fire to Jehovah must be excluded from the people .
» ‘ Never eat the blood of any bird or animal no matter where you live .
» ‘ Those who eat any blood must be excluded from the people . ’ «
Jehovah spoke to Moses :
» Tell the Israelites : ‘ Anyone who offers Jehovah a fellowship offering must bring a part of that sacrifice as a gift to Jehovah .
» ‘ Bring the sacrifices by fire made to Jehovah . Bring the fat with the breast . Take the breast and present it to Jehovah .
» ‘ The priest will burn the fat on the altar . However , the breast will belong to Aaron and his sons .
» ‘ You will also give the priest the right thigh as a contribution .
» ‘ When any of Aaron's sons offer the blood and fat of the fellowship offering , the right thigh will belong to him as his share .
» ‘ I have taken the breast and thigh that was presented to me from the contribution offering from the Israelites . I have given them to the priest Aaron and his sons . This is a long lasting law for generations to come .
» ‘ This is the share for Aaron and his sons from the sacrifices by fire made to Jehovah . It was given to them on the day Moses ordained them to serve Jehovah as priests . ’ «
Jehovah commanded the Israelites to give it to them on the day he anointed them . This is a long lasting law for generations to come .
These are the instructions for the burnt offering , the grain offering , the offering for sin , the guilt offering , the ordination offering , and the fellowship offering .
On Mount Sinai Jehovah gave Moses commands about these offerings . At the same time he commanded the Israelites to bring their offerings to him in the Sinai Desert .
Jehovah continued to speak to Moses :
» Bring Aaron and his sons , the priests' clothes , the anointing oil , the bull that will be the offered for sin , the two rams , and the basket of unleavened bread .
» Gather the entire congregation at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting . «
Moses did as Jehovah commanded him . All the people gathered assembled at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting .
Moses announced to the congregation : » Jehovah has commanded that this is what you must do ! «
Moses had Aaron and his sons come forward . Then he washed them with water .
He clothed Aaron with the embroidered tunic and tied the sash around him . He also dressed him in the linen robe that is worn with the ephod . He fastened the ephod to it .
Then he placed the breastplate on him and he placed the Urim and Thummim .
He put the turban on Aaron’s head and fastened the gold medallion , the holy crown , to the front of the turban as Jehovah had commanded Moses .
Moses took the anointing oil to anoint the tent and everything in it and dedicate them .
He sprinkled the altar seven times . He anointed the altar ; it’s utensils , the washbasin and its pedestal . This made them holy .
He also poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron's head and anointed him to set him apart for his holy duties .
Next , Moses dressed the sons of Aaron . He put shirts on them ; put sashes around their waists , and tied caps on their heads , just as Jehovah commanded .
Moses brought the young bull for the sin offering . Aaron and his sons put their hands on its head .
Moses killed it and took some of the blood . Using his finger he put it on the projections at the corners of the altar , in order to dedicate it . He then poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar . In this way he dedicated it and purified it .
Moses took all the fat on the internal organs . He took the best part of the liver , and the kidneys with the fat on them , and burned it all on the altar .
Finally , he took the skin and the flesh of the bull , together with the food still in its stomach , and burned them outside the camp , just as Jehovah commanded .
Moses led out the ram for the sacrifice to please Jehovah . After Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head ,
Moses slaughtered the ram and splattered its blood against the four sides of the altar .
The ram was cut into pieces . Moses burned the head with the other pieces and the fat .
He washed the internal organs and the legs . Then Moses burned the whole ram on the altar as Jehovah commanded him . It was a burnt offering , a pleasant aroma , an offering by fire to Jehovah .
He brought the second ram for the ordination offering . Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the ram's head .
Moses slaughtered it . He took some of the blood , and put it on Aaron's right ear lobe , on his right thumb , and on the big toe of his right foot .
Moses also brought Aaron's sons forward . He put some of the blood on their right ear lobes , on their right thumbs , and on the big toes of their right feet . Moses threw the rest of the blood against all the sides of the altar .
He took the fat from the tail , all the fat on the internal organs , the lobe of the liver , the two kidneys with their fat , and the right thigh .
He took a loaf of unleavened bread , a ring of bread made with olive oil . He took a wafer from the basket of unleavened bread in Jehovah’s presence . He put them on the fat and the right thigh .
He placed all these things in the hands of Aaron and his sons . Moses presented all these things to Jehovah as an offering .
Then he took them from their hands and burned them on top of the burnt offering on the altar . These were ordination offerings , offerings by fire , a soothing aroma to Jehovah .
Moses also took the breast from the ram of the ordination offering and presented it to Jehovah . It was Moses' share , as Jehovah commanded .
Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was on the altar . He sprinkled it on Aaron and his clothes and on his sons and their clothes . In this way he dedicated Aaron , his clothes , his sons , and their clothes .
Moses told Aaron and his sons : » Cook the meat at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting . Take the meat and the bread in the basket of the ordination offering . Eat them there as I commanded when I said : ‘ Aaron and his sons will eat it . ’
» You must burn all meat or bread that is left over .
» You will not leave the entrance to the Tent of Meeting for seven days . Do not leave until the last day of your ordination is over . It will take seven days to ordain you .
» I did today what Jehovah commanded me to pay compensation for wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah for you .
» You will stay at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting day and night for seven days and keep the watch as Jehovah directs you . Then you will not die . This is what I was commanded . «
So Aaron and his sons did everything Jehovah commanded through Moses .
On the eighth day Moses summoned Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel .
He told Aaron : » Take a calf that has no defects for an offering for sin and a ram that has no defects as a burnt offering . Sacrifice them in Jehovah’s presence .
» Tell the Israelites : ‘ Take a male goat as an offering for sin , a calf and a lamb , each one-year-old and without defects , as a burnt offering ,
a bull and a ram as a fellowship offering , and a grain offering mixed with olive oil to sacrifice in Jehovah’s presence . Jehovah will appear to you today . ’ «
They took the things Moses commanded and brought them in front of the Tent of Meeting . The entire congregation stood in Jehovah’s presence .
Moses said : » Jehovah commanded you to offer these sacrifices so that you may see Jehovah’s glory . «
Moses told Aaron : » Come to the altar and sacrifice an offering for sin and a burnt offering to pay compensation for your sins and the sins of the people and make peace with Jehovah . Then make an offering for the people that they may pay compensation for their wrongdoing and to make peace with Jehovah just as Jehovah has commanded . «
Aaron came to the altar and slaughtered the calf as his own offering for sin .
Aaron's sons brought him the blood . He dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar . After that he poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar .
On the altar he burned the fat , kidneys , and lobe of the liver from the offering for sin as Jehovah commanded Moses .
He burned the meat and the skin outside the camp .
He slaughtered the animal for the burnt offering . Aaron's sons gave him the blood . He threw it against the altar on all sides .
They also gave him the burnt offering . It was cut in pieces and included the head . He burned it on the altar .
He washed the internal organs and the legs and laid them on top of the burnt offering on the altar .
He brought the people's offerings . He took the male goat for the people's offering for sin and slaughtered it . Then he sacrificed it to take away sins as he had done before .
He followed the proper procedures and brought forward the burnt offering and sacrificed it .
He also brought the grain offering . He took a handful of grain and burned it on the altar in addition to the morning burnt offering .
He slaughtered the bull and the ram for the people's fellowship offering . Aaron's sons gave him the blood . He threw it against the altar on all sides .
The fat from the bull and the ram , the fat from the tail , the layer of fat , the kidneys , and the lobe of the liver
they placed on the breasts . Aaron burned them all on the altar .
First he took the breasts and the right thighs and presented them to Jehovah just as Moses commanded .
Aaron raised his hands toward the people and blessed them . He sacrificed the offering for sin , the burnt offering , and the fellowship offering . Then he came down from the altar .
Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting . As soon as they came out , they blessed the people . Then Jehovah’s glory appeared to all the people .
Fire came out from Jehovah’s presence and consumed the burnt offering and the pieces of fat on the altar . As soon as all the people saw this , they shouted and bowed with their faces touching the ground .
Aaron's sons Nadab and Abihu each took an incense burner . They put burning coals and incense in it . Then in Jehovah’s presence they offered this unauthorized fire .
A fire flashed from Jehovah and burned them . They died in the presence of Jehovah .
Moses said to Aaron : » This is what Jehovah was speaking about when he said : ‘ All who serve me must respect my holiness . I will reveal my glory to my people . ’ « But Aaron remained silent .
Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan , the sons of Uzziel , Aaron's uncle . He said : » Come here and carry your cousins' bodies away from the sacred tent and put them outside the camp . «
So they came and took hold of the clothing on the corpses . They carried them outside the camp just as Moses had commanded .
Moses said to Aaron and to his sons Eleazar and Ithamar : Do not leave your hair uncombed or tear your clothes to show that you are in mourning . If you do you will die . For Jehovah will be angry with the whole community . But all other Israelites are allowed to mourn this death caused by the fire Jehovah sent .
» You are Jehovah’s chosen priests . You must not leave the sacred tent , or you will die . « Aaron and his two sons obeyed Moses .
Jehovah said to Aaron :
» Never drink beer or wine when you or your sons enter the sacred tent . If you do , you will die right there ! This is a long lasting law from generation to generation .
» You must learn the difference distinction between what is holy and what is not holy and between the clean and the unclean .
» You must also teach the people of Israel everything that I commanded Moses to say to them . «
Moses spoke to Aaron and his two remaining sons , Eleazar and Ithamar . He said : » Take the grain offering that is left over from the food offered to Jehovah . Bake unleavened bread with it and eat it beside the altar . This is because this offering is very holy .
» Eat it in a holy place . It is the part that belongs to you and your sons from the food offered to Jehovah . That is what Jehovah commanded me .
» You and your families may eat the breast and the hind leg that are presented as the special gift and the special contribution to Jehovah for the priests . You may eat them in any ritually clean place . These offerings have been given to you and your children as the part that belongs to you from the fellowship offerings of the people of Israel .
» They shall bring the hind leg and the breast at the time the fat is presented as a food offering to Jehovah . These parts belong to you and your children from generation to generation , just as Jehovah commanded . «
Moses asked about the goat for the sin offering and learned that it had already been burned . This made him angry with Eleazar and Ithamar . He demanded :
» Why did you not eat the sin offering in a sacred place ? It is very holy ! Jehovah gave it to you in order to take away the sin of the community .
» Since its blood was not brought into the sacred Tent , you should have eaten the sacrifice there , as I commanded . «
Aaron answered : » If I had eaten the sin offering today , would Jehovah have approved ? The people presented their sin offering to Jehovah today . They brought their burnt offering , but still these terrible things have happened to me . «
When Moses heard this , he was satisfied .
Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron :
» Tell the Israelites : ‘ Here are the kinds of land animals you may eat :
» ‘ You may eat all animals that have completely divided hoofs and that also chew their cud .
» ‘ You must not eat those that either chew their cud or have divided hoofs . These are the kinds you must never eat : You must never eat camels . Camels are unclean because they chew their cud but do not have divided hoofs .
» ‘ Never eat rock badgers . Rock badgers are unclean because they chew their cud but do not have divided hoofs .
» ‘ You must never eat rabbits . Rabbits are unclean because they chew their cud but do not have divided hoofs .

» ‘ Never eat the meat of these animals or touch their dead bodies . They are unclean for you .
» ‘ Here are the kinds of creatures that live in the water that you may eat . You may eat anything in the seas and streams that have fins and scales .

» ‘ They must remain disgusting to you . Never eat their meat . Consider their dead bodies repulsive .
» ‘ Every creature in the water without fins or scales is offensive to you .
» ‘ Here are the kinds of birds you must consider disgusting and must not eat . They are eagles , bearded vultures , black vultures ,

» ‘ However , you may eat winged insects that swarm if they use their legs to hop on the ground .
» ‘ You may eat any kind of locust , cricket , katydid , or grasshopper .
» ‘ Every kind of winged insect that walks across the ground like a four-legged animal is disgusting to you .
» ‘ Regarding the creatures mentioned above , this is how you would become unclean : When you touch their dead bodies you will be unclean until evening .
» ‘ When you carry any part of their dead bodies you must wash your clothes . You will be unclean until evening .
» ‘ All animals whose hoofs are not completely divided or that do not chew their cud are unclean for you . Whoever touches them is unclean .
» ‘ All four-legged animals that walk on their paws are unclean for you . Whoever touches their dead bodies will be unclean until evening .
» ‘ Those who carry the dead body of any of these animals must wash their clothes and will be unclean until evening . These animals are unclean for you .
» ‘ The following swarming creatures that move on the ground are unclean for you : the weasels , mole rats , mice , and all types of lizards ,
geckos , monitors , lizards , skinks , and chameleons .
» ‘ Of all the swarming creatures that move on the ground , these are unclean for you . He who touches their dead bodies will be unclean until evening .
» ‘ When the dead body of one of these creatures falls on something , that thing will be unclean . It may be a wooden article , clothing , leather , a sack , or anything used for any purpose . It should be put in water and will be unclean until evening . It will then be clean again .
» ‘ If any of these creatures falls into a piece of pottery , break the pottery because everything in it is unclean .
» ‘ If water from that pottery touches any food , the food is unclean . Any liquid that you drink from that pottery is unclean .
» ‘ Anything on which their dead bodies fall is unclean . If it is an oven or a stove , smash it . It is unclean and will remain unclean for you .
» ‘ A spring or a cistern holding water will remain clean . But anyone who touches their dead bodies will be unclean .
» ‘ If their dead bodies fall on seed that is to be planted , the seed is clean .

» ‘ Do not become disgusting by eating anything that swarms on the ground . Do not allow yourselves to become unclean because of them .
» ‘ The reason is because I am Jehovah your God . You must live holy lives . Consecrate yourselves and be holy because I am holy . Never become unclean by touching anything that swarms or crawls on the ground .
» ‘ I am Jehovah ! I brought you out of Egypt to be your God . Be holy because I am holy .
» ‘ This is the law about animals , birds , and every living creature that swims in the water and every creature that swarms on the ground .
» ‘ This law helps you distinguish between clean and unclean , the animals you may eat and those you may not eat . ’ «
Jehovah spoke to Moses :
» Tell the Israelites : ‘ When a woman gives birth to a boy , she will be unclean for seven days . This is the same number of days she is unclean for her monthly period .
» ‘ The boy must be circumcised when he is eight days old .
» ‘ She must stay at home for thirty-three days in order to be made clean from her bleeding . She must not touch anything holy or go into the holy place until the days needed to make her clean are over .
» ‘ When a woman gives birth to a girl , she will be unclean as in her monthly period . She will be unclean for two weeks . Then she must stay at home for sixty-six days in order to be made clean from her bleeding .
» ‘ When the days needed to make her clean are over , she must bring a one-year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a pigeon or a mourning dove as an offering for sin . She should bring them to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting .
» ‘ The priest will offer them in Jehovah’s presence to pay compensation for sin and make peace with Jehovah for her . Then she will be clean from her flow of blood . These are the instructions for the woman who gives birth to a boy or a girl .
» ‘ If she cannot afford a lamb , she must use two mourning doves or two pigeons . One will be the burnt offering and the other the offering for sin . So the priest will pay compensation for sin and make peace with Jehovah for her and she will be clean . ’ «
Jehovah gave Moses and Aaron these regulations :
» If any of you have a sore on your skin or a boil or an inflammation that could develop into a dreaded skin disease , you shall be brought to the priest .
» The priest will examine the sore . If the hairs in it have turned white and the sore appears to be deeper than the surrounding skin , it is a dreaded skin disease , and the priest will pronounce you unclean .
» If the sore is white and does not appear to be deeper than the skin around it and the hairs have not turned white , the priest will isolate you for seven days .
» The priest will examine you again on the seventh day . If in his opinion the sore looks the same and has not spread , he will isolate you for another seven days .

» In case any of you have been burned . If the raw flesh becomes white or reddish-white ,
the priest will examine it . If the hair on the affected area has turned white and the affected area looks deeper than the rest of the skin , an infectious skin disease has developed in the burn . The priest will pronounce you unclean . It is an infectious skin disease .

» When there is mildew on clothing , whether wool or linen ,
or on any woven piece of linen or wool cloth or on leather or anything made of leather ,
if it is greenish or reddish , it is a spreading mildew and must be shown to the priest .
» The priest shall examine it and put the object away for seven days .
» He will examine it again on the seventh day . If the mildew has spread , the object is unclean .
» The priest will burn it , because it is a spreading mildew . It must be destroyed by fire .
» If the priest finds that the mildew has not spread on the object ,
he will order that it be washed and put away for another seven days .
» He shall examine it again and if the mildew has not changed color , even though it has not spread , it is still unclean . You must burn the object , whether the rot is on the front or the back .

» Then if the mildew reappears , it is spreading again , and the owner must burn the object .
» If he washes the object and the spot disappears , he should wash it again . It will be ritually clean . «
This is the law about mildew on clothing . Whether it is wool or linen , or on linen or wool cloth or on anything made of leather ; this is how the decision is made as to whether it is ritually clean or unclean .
Jehovah gave Moses
the following regulations about the ritual purification of those of you cured of a dreaded skin disease : » On the day you are to be pronounced clean , you should be brought to the priest .
» The priest will take you outside the camp and examine you . If the disease is healed ,
the priest will order that two ritually clean birds be brought , along with a piece of cedar wood , a red cord , and a sprig of hyssop .
» The priest will order that one of the birds be killed over a clay bowl containing fresh spring water .
» He will take the other bird and dip it , together with the cedar wood , the red cord , and the hyssop , in the blood of the bird that was killed .
» He will sprinkle the blood seven times on the one of you who is to be purified from your skin disease . He will then pronounce you clean . He will let the live bird fly away over the open fields .
» You must wash your clothes , shave off all your hair , and take a bath . You will then be ritually clean . You may enter the camp . You must live outside your tent for seven days .
» On the seventh day you should again shave your head , your beard , your eyebrows , and all the rest of the hair on your body . You should wash your clothes and take a bath . Then you will be ritually clean .
» The eighth day bring two male lambs and one female lamb a year old that are without any defects . Also bring five pounds of flour mixed with olive oil , and half a pint of olive oil .
» The priest will take you and these offerings to the entrance of the Tent of Jehovah’s presence .
» Then the priest will take one of the male lambs and together with the half pint of oil he will offer it as a repayment offering . He will present them as a special gift to Jehovah for the priest .
» He will slaughter the lamb in the holy place where the animals for the sin offerings and the burnt offerings are slaughtered . He must do this because the repayment offering , like the sin offering , belongs to the priest and is very holy .
» The priest will take some of the blood from the guilt offering and put it on the right ear lobe , on the right thumb , and on the big toe of the right foot of the one to be cleansed .
» The priest will also take some of the olive oil and pour it into his own left hand .
» He will dip his right finger in the oil in his left hand , and with his finger sprinkle some of the oil seven times in Jehovah’s presence .
» The priest will put some of the oil that is still in his hand on the right ear lobe , on the right thumb , and on the big toe of the right foot of the one to be cleansed . These are the same places he had put the blood of the guilt offering .
» The priest will put the rest of the oil in his hand on the head of the one to be cleansed . So he will pay compensation for wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah for that person in Jehovah’s presence .
» The priest will also sacrifice the offering for sin to make peace with Jehovah for the one who is being cleansed from his impurity . After that , he will slaughter the burnt offering .
» He will sacrifice the burnt offering and the grain offering on the altar . So the priest will pay compensation for the wrong and make peace with Jehovah for that person . The person who had the skin disease will be clean .
» If the one to be cleansed is poor and cannot afford that much , he must take one male lamb , present it to pay compensation for the wrong and make peace with Jehovah for himself , and use it for his guilt offering . He will take only eight cups of flour mixed with olive oil as a grain offering , a quart of olive oil ,
and two mourning doves or two pigeons , whatever he can afford . The one will be an offering for sin and the other a burnt offering .
» The eighth day he will take them to the priest for his cleansing at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting in Jehovah’s presence .
» The priest will take the lamb for the guilt offering and the quart of olive oil and present them to Jehovah .
» He will slaughter the lamb as a guilt offering . The priest will take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the right ear lobe , on the right thumb , and on the big toe of the right foot of the one to be cleansed .
» The priest will pour some of the olive oil into his own left hand .
» In Jehovah’s presence he will sprinkle some of the oil with his right finger seven times .
» The priest will put some of the oil that is in his hand on the right ear lobe , on the right thumb , and on the big toe of the right foot of the one to be cleansed . These are the same places he had put the blood of the guilt offering .
» In Jehovah’s presence , the priest will pour the rest of the oil in his hand on the head of the one to be cleansed in order to make a payment for him .
» The one to be cleansed must take one of the mourning doves or pigeons , the one he can afford ,
and sacrifice it as an offering for sin . He will take the other and sacrifice it as a burnt offering together with the grain offering . So in Jehovah’s presence the priest will pay compensation for the wrong and make peace with Jehovah for the one who is being cleansed .
» These are the instructions for one who has an infectious skin disease but cannot afford what is needed for his cleansing . «
Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron :
» When you come to Canaan that I am going to give to you , mildew may appear in a house .
» The owner of that house must come and tell the priest that there is something that looks like mildew in his house .
» Before the priest examines the house , he will order everything taken out of it so that nothing in the house will become unclean . Then the priest will go inside to examine the house .
» He will examine the mildew area on the walls . If it is green and red in sunken areas that are deeper than the rest of the wall ,
the priest will go out to the door of the house and close up the house for seven days .
» The priest will go back and examine it again on the seventh day . If the mildew in the walls of the house has spread ,
he must order the stones that have the mildew to be torn out and thrown outside the city in an unclean place .
» He must have the entire inside of the house scraped . The plaster dust scraped off the walls must be dumped in an unclean place outside the city .
» The stones must be replaced , and the house must be plastered again .
» If the mildew breaks out again in the house after the stones have been removed and the house has been scraped and plastered ,
the priest will go and look . If it has spread , the house is unclean .
» It must be torn down , and its stones , its wood , and all its plaster must be carried out of the city to an unclean place .
» Whoever goes into the house during the time that he has quarantined it , becomes unclean until evening .
» Whoever lies down in the house must wash his clothes , and whoever eats in the house must wash his clothes .
» If the mildew has not reappeared after the house has been replastered , the priest will pronounce the house ritually clean . This is because the mildew has been completely removed .
» He shall take two birds , some cedar wood , a red cord , and a sprig of hyssop to purify the house .
» He should kill one of the birds over a clay bowl containing fresh spring water .
» Then he will take the cedar wood , the hyssop , the red cord , and the live bird and dip them in the blood of the bird that was killed and in the fresh water . He will sprinkle the house seven times .
» This is the way he will purify the house with the bird's blood , the fresh water , the live bird , the cedar wood , the hyssop , and the red cord .
» Then the priest will let the living bird fly from the city into the open country . He will pay compensation for wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah for the house . It will be clean . «
These are the instructions for any kind of mildew or fungus
that infects clothing or houses
and for skin diseases where there is a sore , a rash , or an irritated area .
These instructions for skin diseases and mildew help you distinguish between what is clean and unclean .
Again Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron :
» Tell the Israelites : ‘ When a man has a discharge from his body , his discharge is unclean .
» ‘ He is unclean because of the discharge from his body . Whether it is chronic or not makes no difference . He is still unclean .
» ‘ The man who has a discharge makes everything he lies on or sits on unclean .
» ‘ Those who touch his bed must wash their clothes and their bodies . They will be unclean until evening .
» ‘ Those who sit on anything he sat on must wash their clothes and their bodies . They will be unclean until evening .
» ‘ Those who touch a man who has a discharge must wash their clothes and their bodies . They will be unclean until evening .
» ‘ Should a man who has a discharge spit on anyone who is clean , the person he spits on must wash his clothes and his body . He will be unclean until evening .
» ‘ When a man who has a discharge sits on a saddle , it becomes unclean .
» ‘ Those who carry such things must wash their clothes and their bodies . They will be unclean until evening .
» ‘ If a man who has a discharge touches anyone without first rinsing his hands , the person he touched must wash his clothes and his body . He will be unclean until evening .
» ‘ When a man who has a discharge touches pottery , it must be broken . When he touches a wooden bucket it must be rinsed .
» ‘ When a man's discharge stops , he must wait seven days to be cleansed . He must wash his clothes and his body in fresh water . Then he will be clean .
» ‘ He must take two mourning doves or two pigeons and come into Jehovah’s presence at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting on the eighth day . He will give these birds to the priest .
» ‘ The priest will sacrifice one as an offering for sin and the other as a burnt offering . Thus in Jehovah’s presence , the priest will pay compensation for the wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah for the man who had a discharge .
» ‘ If a man has an emission of semen , he must bathe his whole body . He will be unclean until evening .
» ‘ Any clothes or any leather with semen on it must be washed . It will be unclean until evening .
» ‘ When a man has sexual intercourse with a woman and has an emission of semen , they must wash themselves . They will be unclean until evening .
» ‘ When a woman has her monthly period , she will be unclean for seven days . Those who touch her will be unclean until evening .
» ‘ Everything she lies on or sits on during her period will be unclean .
» ‘ Those who touch her bed must wash their clothes and their bodies . They will be unclean until evening .
» ‘ Those who touch anything she sits on must wash their clothes and their bodies . They will be unclean until evening .
» ‘ If her blood touches anything on the bed or anything she sits on , it will be unclean until evening .
» ‘ If a man has sexual intercourse with her while she has her period , he will be unclean for seven days . Any bed he lies on will become unclean .
» ‘ When a woman has a discharge of blood for many days other than her monthly period , she is unclean . If her period lasts longer than usual , she will be unclean as long as she has a discharge . It is similar to her period .
» ‘ As long as she has a discharge , any bed she lies on or anything she sits on is unclean . It is similar to her period .
» ‘ Those who touch these things are unclean and must wash their clothes and their bodies . They will be unclean until evening .
» ‘ When her discharge stops she must wait seven days . After that she will be clean .
» ‘ She must take two mourning doves or two pigeons on the eighth day and bring them to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting .
» ‘ The priest will offer one as an offering for sin and the other as a burnt offering . So in Jehovah’s presence the priest will pay compensation for wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah for the woman who had an unclean discharge . ’ «
» You must separate the Israelites from anything that keeps them from being presentable to me . Otherwise they will die . This is because they defile my tent , which is among them , and make it unclean . «
These are the instructions for any man , who has a discharge or an emission of semen that makes him unclean ,
for any woman who has her period , for any man or woman who has a discharge , or for any man who has sexual intercourse with a woman when she is unclean .
Jehovah spoke to Moses after Aaron's two sons came into Jehovah’s presence and died .
Jehovah said : » Tell your brother Aaron that he cannot go into the holy place whenever he wants to . If he goes up to the canopy and stands in front of the throne of mercy on the Ark , he will die . This is because I appear in the smoke above the throne of mercy .
» This is what Aaron must do in order to come into the holy place : He must take a bull as an offering for sin and a ram as a burnt offering .
» He must dress in a holy linen robe and wear linen undergarments . He must wear a linen belt and turban . These are holy clothes . He should wash his body and put them on .
» He will take two male goats from the congregation of Israel as an offering for sin and a ram as a burnt offering .
» Aaron must sacrifice the bull as his own offering for sin . By doing this , he will pay compensation for wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah for himself and his family .
» He must take the two male goats and bring them into Jehovah’s presence at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting .
» I will show Aaron which goat will be sacrificed to me and which one will be sent into the desert to the demon Azazel .
» After he offers the first goat as a sacrifice for sin ,
the other one must be presented to me alive , before he sends it into the desert to take away the sins of the people .
» He must offer the bull as a sacrifice to ask forgiveness for your own sins and for the sins of your family .
» He will take an incense burner full of burning coals from the altar in Jehovah’s presence , and two handfuls of finely ground , sweet-smelling incense . He will bring them up to the canopy .
» He must place the incense on the fire in Jehovah’s presence . The cloud of incense will cover the throne of mercy . This is over the words of God's promise , so that he will not die .
» He will take some of the bull's blood and sprinkle it with his finger on the east side of the throne of mercy . Then he will sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times in front of the throne of mercy .
» Aaron will slaughter the goat for the people's offering for sin . He will take the blood inside , go up to the canopy , and sprinkle it on the throne of mercy and in front of it , as he did with the bull's blood .
» He will pay compensation for the wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah for all the sins the Israelites committed against the holy place . These sins happened because the Israelites were unclean and because they committed rebellious acts . He will do the same for the Tent of Meeting that is among an unclean people .
» No one may be in the Tent of Meeting from the time Aaron enters the holy place to do this until he comes out . Aaron will pay compensation for wrongdoing and peace with Jehovah for his own sins , his family's sins , and the sins of the entire assembly of Israel .
» He will go out to the altar in Jehovah’s presence and pay compensation for the wrong and make peace with Jehovah for the sins committed . He will take some of the blood from the bull and some of the goat's blood and put it all around the horns of the altar .
» With his finger he will sprinkle some of the blood on it seven times . Because the Israelites made it unclean , he will cleanse it and declare it holy .
» When he finishes making peace with Jehovah at the holy place , the Tent of Meeting , and the altar , he will bring the living goat forward .
» Aaron will place both hands on its head . He will confess over it all the sins , all the rebellious acts , and all the things the Israelites did wrong . He will transfer them to the goat's head . A man will be appointed to release the goat in the desert .
» The goat will take all their sins away to a deserted place . The man must release the goat in the desert .
» Aaron will go to the Tent of Meeting . He will take off the linen clothes he put on to go into the holy place , and leave them there .
» He will wash his body in the holy place and put on his other clothes . Then he will come out and sacrifice the burnt offering for himself and for the people to make peace with Jehovah for his own sins and the sins of the people .
» He will burn the fat of the offering for sin on the altar .
» The man who released the goat to Azazel must wash his clothes and his body . Then he may return to the camp .
» The bull and the goat used for the sin offering , whose blood was brought into the Most Holy Place to take away sin , will be carried outside the camp and burned . Skin , meat , and intestines must all be burned .
» The one who burns them must wash his clothes and take a bath before he returns to camp .
» The following regulations are to be observed for a long lasting time to come . On the tenth day of the seventh month the Israelites and the foreigners living among them must fast and must not do any work .
» On that day the ritual is to be performed to purify them from all their sins , so that they will be ritually clean .
» That day is to be a very holy day , one on which they fast and do no work at all . These regulations are to be observed for a long lasting time to come .
» High Priest , properly ordained and consecrated to succeed his father , is to perform the ritual of purification . He must dress in priestly garments
and perform the ritual to purify the Most Holy Place , the rest of the Tent of Jehovah’s presence , the altar , the priests , and all the people of the community .
» These regulations are to be observed for a long lasting time to come . This ritual must be performed once a year to purify the people of Israel from all their sins . « So Moses did as Jehovah commanded .
Jehovah commanded Moses :
» Give Aaron and his sons and all the people of Israel the following regulations .
» Any Israelite who slaughters a bull , sheep , or goat inside or outside the camp
is guilty of bloodshed . He has shed blood and must be excluded from the people . Bring the animal to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting . Offer it to Jehovah in front of the Jehovah’s Tent .
» This means that the people of Israel must take the sacrifices they have been making in the open fields and bring them to Jehovah . They must bring them to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting . The people will sacrifice them as peace offerings to Jehovah .
» The priest will pour the blood against Jehovah’s altar at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting . He will burn the fat as a soothing aroma to Jehovah .
» The people must stop sacrificing to goat idols demons and chasing after them as though they were prostitutes . This is a long lasting law for the people and for future generations .
» Tell them : ‘ If Israelites or foreigners make burnt offerings or sacrifices ,

» That is why I have said to the people of Israel : ‘ Neither you nor foreigners should ever eat blood . ’ «
» If Israelites or foreigners hunt any animal or bird that may be eaten , they must pour out the animal's blood and cover it with dirt .

Jehovah gave Moses these instructions for Aaron's sons , the priests : » Touching a dead body will make you unclean . So do not go near a dead relative ,
except for your mother , father , son , daughter , brother ,
or an unmarried sister , who has no husband to take care of her .
» As the head of your people , you should never become unclean . That would make you unholy .
» You should never mourn by shaving bald spots on your heads , shaving the edges of your beards , or slashing your bodies .
» Be God's holy men . Do not dishonor the name of your God . Be holy because you bring sacrifices by fire to Jehovah . It is the food bread of your God .
» Never marry prostitutes , those who have lost their virginity , or divorced women because a priest is God's holy man .
» Be holy because you offer the food of your God . Be holy because I , Jehovah , am holy . I set you apart as holy .
» When a priest's daughter dishonors herself by becoming a prostitute , she dishonors her father . She must be burned .
» The priest who is anointed with oil and wears the chief priest's clothes is chief over his brothers . He must never mourn by leaving his hair uncombed or by tearing his clothes .
» He must not go near any dead bodies or become unclean , even for his father or mother .
» He must not leave the holy tent of his God . If he does , he will be dishonoring it , because he is dedicated with the anointing oil of his God . I am Jehovah .
» The anointed priest should marry a virgin .
» He must not marry a widow , a divorced woman , a woman who has lost her virginity , or a prostitute . He may only marry a virgin from his own people .
» He must not dishonor his children among his people because I , Jehovah , set him apart as holy . «
Jehovah spoke to Moses :
» Tell Aaron : ‘ If any of your descendants , now or in future generations , has a physical defect , he must never bring food to offer to God .
» ‘ No one who has a physical defect may ever come near the altar . That means anyone who is blind or lame , who has a disfigured face , a deformity ,
or a crippled hand or foot ,
who is a hunchback or dwarf , who has defective sight , skin diseases , or crushed testicles .
» ‘ If a descendant of the priest Aaron has a physical defect , he must never bring sacrifices by fire to Jehovah . He has a defect . He must never bring food to offer to God .
» ‘ He may eat the food of his God , what is holy and what is very holy .
» ‘ However , he must never come up to the canopy or to the altar , since he has a physical defect . He must never dishonor the holy places because I , Jehovah , set them apart as holy . ’ «
Thus Moses spoke to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites .
Jehovah continued to speak to Moses :
» Tell Aaron and his sons that they must respect the holy offerings that the Israelites set apart for me . In this way they will not dishonor my holy name . I am Jehovah . «
» Tell them : ‘ In future generations if any of your descendants , while unclean , comes near the holy offerings the Israelites set apart for Jehovah , that person must be excluded from my presence . I am Jehovah .
» ‘ None of the descendants of Aaron who has a dreaded skin disease or a discharge may eat any of the sacred offerings until he is ritually clean . Any priest is unclean if he touches anything that is unclean through contact with a corpse or if he has an emission of semen
or if he has touched an unclean animal or person .
» ‘ Any priest who becomes unclean remains unclean until evening . Even then he may not eat any of the sacred offerings until he has taken a bath .
» ‘ After the sunsets he is clean . Then he may eat the sacred offerings , which are his food .
» ‘ He must not eat the meat of any animal that has died a natural death or has been killed by wild animals . It will make him unclean . I am Jehovah .
» ‘ All priests must observe the regulations that I have given . Otherwise , they will become guilty and die , because they have disobeyed the sacred regulations . I am Jehovah and I make them holy .
» ‘ Only a member of a priestly family may eat any of the sacred offerings . No one else may eat them , not even someone staying with a priest or hired by him .
» ‘ A priest's slaves , bought with his own money or born in his home , may eat the food the priest receives .
» ‘ A priest's daughter who marries someone who is not a priest may not eat any of the sacred offerings .
» ‘ A widowed or divorced daughter who has no children and who has returned to live in her father's house as a dependent may eat the food her father receives as a priest . Only a member of a priestly family may eat any of it .
» ‘ If any people who are not members of a priestly family eat any of the sacred offerings without intending to , they must repay the priest its full value plus an additional twenty percent .
» ‘ The priests must not profane the sacred offerings
by letting any unauthorized people eat them . This would bring guilt and punishment on such people . I am Jehovah and I make the offerings holy . ’ «
Jehovah continued to speak to Moses :
» Speak to Aaron , his sons , and all the Israelites , and tell them : ‘ Israelites or foreigners may bring burnt offerings to Jehovah for anything they vowed or as freewill offerings .
» ‘ The offering must be a male that has no defects from your cattle , sheep , or goats in order to be accepted .
» ‘ Do not bring any animal with a physical defect . This is because it will not be acceptable for you .
» ‘ A person may bring Jehovah a peace offering to fulfill a vow or for a freewill offering . Whether it is from the cattle , sheep , or goats , it must be an animal that has no defects in order to be acceptable . It must never be an animal that has defects .
» ‘ Do not bring Jehovah an animal that is blind , has broken bones , cuts , warts , scabs , or ringworm . Never give Jehovah any of these in a sacrifice by fire on the altar .
» ‘ You may use a bull or a sheep with a deformity or one that is stunted in growth as a freewill offering . However , it will not be accepted for a vow .
» ‘ Do not bring Jehovah an animal that has bruised , crushed , torn out , or cut out testicles . Never do any of these things to an animal in your land .
» ‘ Never bring any kind of castrated animal received from a foreigner as a food offering for your God . A castrated animal will not be accepted on your behalf because castration is a physical defect . ’ «
Jehovah continued to speak to Moses .
He said : » When a calf , a lamb , or a goat is born , it must stay with its mother for seven days . It may be accepted as a sacrifice by fire to Jehovah from the eighth day on .
» Do not slaughter a cow or a sheep and its young the same day .
» When you sacrifice a thanksgiving offering to Jehovah do it in the proper way .
» Eat it the same day . Never leave any of it until morning . I am Jehovah .
» Carefully obey my commandments . Conform your life to them . I am Jehovah .
» Never dishonor my holy name . I will show my holiness among the Israelites . I am Jehovah , who sets you apart as holy .
» I brought you out of Egypt to be your God . I am Jehovah !
Jehovah spoke to Moses :
» Tell the Israelites : ‘ These are the appointed festivals with Jehovah . You must announce these as holy assemblies .
» ‘ You may work for six days . But the seventh day is a day of worship Sabbath , a day when you do not work , and a holy assembly . Do not do any work . It is Jehovah’s day of worship wherever you live .
» ‘ The following are Jehovah’s appointed festivals with holy assemblies . You must announce these at their appointed times .
» ‘ The Passover , celebrated to honor Jehovah , begins at sunset on the fourteenth day of the first month .
» ‘ The fifteenth day of the same month the Festival of Unleavened Bread begins . You must not eat any bread made with yeast for seven days .
» ‘ Gather to worship on the first of these days . Do none of your daily work .
» ‘ Bring a sacrifice to Jehovah for seven days . On the seventh day there will be a holy assembly . Do not do any regular work . ’ «
Jehovah spoke to Moses :
» Tell the Israelites : ‘ When you come to the land I am going to give you and you harvest grain , bring a bundle of the first grain you harvest to the priest .
» ‘ He will present it to Jehovah so that you will be accepted . He will present it on the day after Passover .
» ‘ On the day you present the bundle , you must sacrifice a one-year-old male lamb that has no defects as a burnt offering to Jehovah .
» ‘ Present a grain offering of four quarts of flour mixed with olive oil with it . This will be a sacrifice by fire made to Jehovah . It will be a soothing aroma . Use one quart of wine for the wine offering .
» ‘ Do not eat bread , roasted grain , or fresh grain until this same day . Then bring the offering to your God . It is a long lasting law for generations to come wherever you live .
» ‘ Count seven full weeks from the day after Passover , the day you bring the bundle of grain as an offering presented to Jehovah
until the day after the seventh week . This is a total of fifty days . Then bring a new grain offering to Jehovah .
» ‘ Bring two loaves of bread from your homes to present to Jehovah . Bake them with four quarts of flour . They are the first harvested grain for Jehovah .
» ‘ Using the bread the community is to present seven one-year-old lambs , one bull , and two rams , none of which may have any defects . They should be offered as a burnt offering to Jehovah , along with a grain offering and a wine offering . The odor of this offering is pleasing to Jehovah .
» ‘ Also offer one male goat as a sin offering and two one-year-old male lambs as a fellowship offering .
» ‘ The priest should present the bread with the two lambs as a special gift to Jehovah for the priests . These offerings are holy .
» ‘ Do none of your daily work . Gather for worship . Your descendants are to observe this regulation from generation to generation , no matter where they live .
» ‘ When you harvest your fields , do not cut the grain at the edges of the fields . Do not go back to cut the heads of grain that were left . Leave them for poor people and foreigners . Jehovah is your God . ’ «
Jehovah continued to speak to Moses :
» Observe a special day of rest on the first day of the seventh month . Gather together for worship when the trumpets sound .
» Present a food offering to Jehovah . Do not do your daily work . «
Jehovah spoke to Moses :
» The tenth day of this seventh month is a special day for the payment for sins . There will be a holy assembly . Humble yourselves , and bring Jehovah a sacrifice by fire .
» Do not do any work that day . It is a special day for the payment for sins . It is a time when you pay compensation for wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah your God .
» Those who do not humble themselves on that day will be excluded from the people .
» I will destroy those who do any work on that day .
» Do not do any work ! It is a long lasting law for generations to come wherever you live .
» It is a day of worship sabbath , a day when you do not work . Humble yourselves starting on the evening of the ninth day of the month . From that evening to the next , observe the day of worship . «
Jehovah spoke to Moses :
Inform the Israelites : ‘ The fifteenth day of this seventh month is the Festival of Booths to Jehovah . It will last seven days .
» ‘ There will be a holy assemble on the first day . Do not do any regular work .
» ‘ Bring a sacrifice by fire to Jehovah for seven consecutive days . On the eighth day there will be a holy assembly . Bring Jehovah a sacrifice by fire . This is the last festival of the year . Do not do any regular work .
» ‘ These are Jehovah’s appointed festivals . Announce them as holy assemblies for bringing sacrifices by fire to Jehovah . Bring burnt offerings , grain offerings , other sacrifices , and wine offerings-each one on its special day .
» ‘ This is in addition to Jehovah’s days of worship , your gifts , all your vows , and your freewill offerings to Jehovah .
» ‘ Celebrate Jehovah’s festival for seven days . This should begin on the fifteenth day of the seventh month ; at the time you gather what the land produces . The first and the eighth days will be worship festivals .
» ‘ Take the best fruits , palm branches , the branches of leafy trees and poplars on the first day , and celebrate in the presence of Jehovah your God for seven days .
» ‘ It is Jehovah’s festival . Celebrate it for seven days each year . This is a long lasting law for generations to come . Celebrate this festival in the seventh month .
» ‘ Live in booths for seven days . Everyone born in Israel must live in booths .
» ‘ This is how generations to come may learn how I made the people of Israel live in booths when I brought them out of Egypt . I am Jehovah your God ! ’ «
Moses told the Israelites about Jehovah’s appointed festivals .
Jehovah spoke to Moses :
» Command the Israelites to bring you pure , virgin olive oil for the lamp stand so that the lamps will not go out .
» Aaron must keep the lamps lit in the Tent of Meeting from evening until morning . This is outside the canopy where the words of my covenant are in Jehovah’s presence . It is a long lasting law for generations to come .
» Aaron must keep the lamps on the pure gold lamp stand lit in Jehovah’s presence .
» Take flour and bake twelve rings of bread . Each ring will contain four quarts of flour .
» Put them in two stacks of six each on the gold table in Jehovah’s presence .
» Place pure incense on top of each stack . The incense on the bread will be a reminder , an offering by fire to Jehovah .
» Every day of worship sabbath day a priest must arrange the bread in Jehovah’s presence . It is a long lasting reminder of my promise to the Israelites .
» The bread will belong to Aaron and his sons . They will eat it in a holy place . It is very holy , set apart from Jehovah’s offering by fire . This is a long lasting law . «
A man , whose mother was Shelomith daughter of Dibri , from the tribe of Dan in Israel and whose father was from Egypt , got into a quarrel with an Israelite in the camp .
The Israelite woman's son began cursing Jehovah’s name and treating it with contempt . So they brought him to Moses .
They held him in custody until Jehovah told them what to do .
Jehovah spoke to Moses :
» The man who cursed my name must be taken outside the camp . All who heard him curse my name must lay their hands on his head . Then the whole congregation must stone him to death .
» Inform the Israelites : ‘ Those who treat their God with contempt will be punished for their sin .
» ‘ However those who curse Jehovah’s name must be put to death . The whole congregation must stone them to death . It makes no difference whether they are Israelites or foreigners . Whoever curses abuses Jehovah’s name must die .
» ‘ Whoever kills another person must be put to death .
» ‘ Whoever kills an animal must replace it , life for life .
» ‘ Should any of you injure another person , whatever you have done shall be done to you .
» ‘ If you break a bone , one of your bones must be broken . If you put out an eye , one of your eyes must be put out . Should you knock out a tooth , one of your teeth shall be knocked out . Whatever injury you cause another person must be done to you in return .
» ‘ Whoever kills an animal shall replace it , but whoever kills a human being shall be put to death .
» ‘ This law applies to all of you . It applies to Israelites and to foreigners living among you . I am Jehovah your God . ’ «
When Moses had said this to the people of Israel , they took the man outside the camp and stoned him to death . The people of Israel did what Jehovah commanded Moses .
Jehovah spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai and commanded :
» Give the following regulations to the people of Israel : ‘ When you enter the land that Jehovah is giving you , honor Jehovah by not cultivating the land every seventh year .
» ‘ Plant your fields , prune your vineyards , and gather your crops for six years .
» ‘ But the seventh year is to be a sabbath year of complete rest for the land . It is a year dedicated to Jehovah . Do not plant your fields or prune your vineyards .
» ‘ Do not even harvest the grain that grows by itself without being planted . Do not gather the grapes from your unpruned vines . It is a year of complete rest for the land .
» ‘ Even though the land has not been cultivated during that year , it will provide food for you , your slaves , your hired men , the foreigners living with you ,
your domestic animals , and the wild animals in your fields . Everything that it produces may be eaten .
» ‘ Count seven times seven years seven sabbaths of years , a total of forty-nine years .
» ‘ Then , on the tenth day of the seventh month , the Day of Atonement , send someone to blow a trumpet throughout the whole land .
» ‘ In this way you will set the fiftieth year apart and proclaim freedom to all the inhabitants of the land . During this year all property that has been sold must be restored to the original owner or the descendants , and any who have been sold as slaves may return to their families .
» ‘ That fiftieth year will be your jubilee year . Do not plant or harvest what grows by itself or pick grapes from the vines in the land .
» ‘ The jubilee year will be holy to you . You will eat what the field itself produces .
» ‘ In this jubilee year every slave will be freed in order to return to his property .
» ‘ In the business of trading goods for money , do no wrong to one another .
» ‘ Corresponding to the number of years after the jubilee , you shall buy from your friend ; he is to sell to you according to the number of years of crops .
» ‘ In proportion to the extent of the years you shall increase its price , and in proportion to the fewness of the years you shall diminish its price , for it is a number of crops he is selling to you .
» ‘ You must not wrong one another . You shall respect your God . I am Jehovah your God .
» ‘ You must observe my statutes and keep my judgments , so as to carry them out . That way you may live securely on the land .
» ‘ The land will give you its products . You will eat all you want and live there securely .
» ‘ » You may ask : » What will we eat in the seventh year if we do not plant or bring in our crops ? « ’ «
» ‘ I will give you my blessing in the sixth year so that the land will produce enough for three years .
» ‘ You will plant again in the eighth year but live on what the land already produced . You will eat it , even in the ninth year , until the land produces more .
» ‘ No land may be permanently bought or sold . It all belongs to me ! It is not your land ! You only live there for a little while .
» ‘ When property is sold , the original owner must be given the first chance to buy it .
» ‘ If any of you Israelites become so poor that you are forced to sell your property , your closest relative must buy it back .
» ‘ If that relative has the money . Later , if you can afford to buy it ,
you must pay enough to make up for what the present owner will lose on it before the next Year of Celebration , when the property would become yours again .
» ‘ If he cannot earn enough to buy it back , what he sold stays in the hands of the buyer until the year of jubilee . In the jubilee it will be released , and he will own it again .
» ‘ If anyone sells a home in a walled city , for one year after selling it he has the right to buy it back . He may buy it back only within that time .
» ‘ If he does not buy it back during that year , the house in the city belongs to the buyer for generations to come . It will not be released in the jubilee .
» ‘ Houses in villages without walls are regarded as belonging to the fields of the land . They can be bought back . They will be released in the jubilee .
» ‘ The Levites always have the right to buy back their property in the cities they own .
» ‘ If any Levite buys back a house , in the jubilee the purchased house in the city will be released . This is because the houses in the Levite cities are their property among the Israelites .
» ‘ But a field that belongs to their cities must not be sold , because it is their property from generation to generation .
» ‘ If an Israelite becomes poor and cannot support himself , you should help him . He must live with you as a stranger without a permanent home .
» ‘ Do not collect interest or make any profit from him . Respect your God by respecting other Israelites' lives .
» ‘ Do not collect any interest on your money or on the food you give them .
» ‘ I am Jehovah your God . I brought you out of Egypt to give you Canaan and to be your God .
» ‘ If an Israelite becomes poor and sells himself to you , do not work him like a slave .
» ‘ He will be like a hired worker or a visitor to you . He may work with you until the year of jubilee .
» ‘ Then you will release him and his children to go back to their family and the property of their ancestors .
» ‘ They are my servants . I brought them out of Egypt . They must never be sold as slaves .
» ‘ Do not treat them harshly . Respect your God .
» ‘ You may have male and female slaves , but buy them from the nations around you .
» ‘ You may also buy the children of the foreigners who are living among you . Such children born in your land may become your property .
» ‘ You may leave them as an inheritance to your children , whom they must serve as long as they live . But you must not treat any Israelites harshly .
» ‘ Suppose a foreigner living with you becomes rich , while some Israelites become poor and sell themselves as slaves to that foreigner or to a member of that foreigner's family .
» ‘ He has the right to be set free by a relative , such as a brother .
» ‘ His uncle , his cousin , or some other relative could also buy him back . If he becomes rich , he could buy his own freedom .
» ‘ Then he and his buyer must take into account the number of years from the year he was bought until the year of jubilee . His sale price will be adjusted based on the number of years he was with his buyer . This is like the wages of a hired worker .

Jehovah spoke to Moses :
» Give the following regulations for the people of Israel : ‘ When any of you have been given to Jehovah in fulfillment of a special vow , you may be set free by the payment of the following sums of money ,
» ‘ This is according to the official standard : adult male , twenty to sixty years old : fifty pieces of silver , adult female : thirty pieces of silver , young male , five to twenty years old : twenty pieces of silver , young female : ten pieces of silver , infant male under five : five pieces of silver , infant female : three pieces of silver , male above sixty years of age : fifteen pieces of silver , female above sixty : ten pieces of silver .

For a man sixty years or over , give six ounces and for a woman give four ounces .
» ‘ The person who is too poor to pay the required amount must stand in front of the priest . The priest will determine the amount based on what the person can afford .
» ‘ If the vow is to give the kind of animal that people offer to Jehovah , it will be considered holy .
» ‘ Do not exchange or substitute animals , a good one for a bad one or a bad one for a good one . If you do exchange one animal for another , then both animals will be holy .
» ‘ If it is an unclean animal that cannot be brought to Jehovah as an offering , bring it in front of the priest .
» ‘ The priest will determine what its value is . The value will be whatever the priest decides .
» ‘ If you want to buy it back , you must pay its full value plus one-fifth more .
» ‘ If you give your house to Jehovah as something holy , the priest will determine what its value is . The value will be whatever the priest decides .
» ‘ If you want to buy it back , you must pay its full value plus one-fifth more .
» ‘ If a person gives part of a field to Jehovah as something holy , its value will be based on the seed planted on it . Ground planted with two quarts of barley will be worth twenty ounces of silver .
» ‘ If you give your field in the jubilee year , it will have its full value .
» ‘ Should you give the field after the jubilee year , the priest will estimate its value based on the number of years left until the next jubilee year .
» ‘ If you want to buy it back , you must pay its full value plus one-fifth more .
» ‘ If you do not buy it back and it is sold to someone else , it may not be redeemed .
» ‘ When the field is released in the jubilee year , it will be holy like a field claimed by Jehovah . It will become the property of the priest .
» ‘ You may give a field you bought , not one that was a part of your family property , to Jehovah as something holy .
» ‘ The priest must figure out the field's value until the jubilee year . You will pay its value on that day as something holy , belonging to Jehovah .
» ‘ In the jubilee year the field will go back to the person from whom it was bought , to whom it belongs as family property .
» ‘ All values will be set using the standard weight of the holy place .
» ‘ A firstborn animal already belongs to Jehovah because it was born first . Therefore , it cannot be set apart as holy . Whether it is a bull or a sheep , it belongs to Jehovah .
» ‘ If it is an unclean animal it must be bought back . The payment will be its full value plus one-fifth more . If it is not bought back , it must be sold at the value given it .
» ‘ However , everything dedicated to Jehovah for destruction , a person , an animal , or a field that belongs to you , must not be sold or bought back . Everything dedicated in that way is very holy . It belongs to Jehovah .
» ‘ People dedicated this way may not be bought back . They must be put to death .
» ‘ One-tenth of what comes from the land , whether grain or fruit , is holy and belongs to Jehovah .
» ‘ If you buy back any part of it , you must add one-fifth more to it .
» ‘ Every tenth head of cattle or sheep that you counted is holy and belongs to Jehovah .
» ‘ You must not look to see if it is good or bad or exchange it . If you do exchange it , both the first animal and its substitute will be holy . They may not be bought back . ’ «

» The Levites will camp all around the tent of God’s words . In this way Jehovah will not be angry with the congregation of Israel . So the Levites will be in charge of the tent of God’s words . «
The Israelites did everything as Jehovah commanded Moses .

As Jehovah had commanded Moses , the Levites were not registered along with the other Israelites .
The Israelites did everything as Jehovah had commanded Moses . They set up camp under their flags , and each person traveled with his own family and household .
This is the list of Aaron and Moses’ descendants when Jehovah spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai .
The names of Aaron’s sons are Nadab firstborn , Abihu , Eleazar , and Ithamar .
These are the names of Aaron’s sons , the anointed priests , who were ordained to serve as priests .
Nadab and Abihu died in Jehovah’s presence because they offered unauthorized fire in his presence in the Desert of Sinai . They had no children . So only Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests during the lifetime of their father Aaron .
Jehovah said to Moses :
» Bring the tribe of Levi , and have them stand in front of the priest Aaron to assist him .
» They will work for him and the whole community in front of the tent of meeting , doing what needs to be done for the inner tent .
» They will take care of all the furnishings in the tent of meeting and work for the Israelites , doing what needs to be done for the inner tent .
» Give the Levites to Aaron and his sons . The Levites will be the only Israelites given to them .
» Appoint Aaron and his sons to serve as priests . Anyone else who tries to do the priests’ duties must be put to death . «
Jehovah said to Moses :
» Out of all the Israelites , I have taken the Levites to be substitutes for every firstborn male offspring among them . The Levites are mine ,
because every firstborn is mine . The day I killed every firstborn male in Egypt , I set apart as holy every firstborn in Israel , whether human or animal . They will be mine . I am Jehovah . «
Jehovah said to Moses in the Desert of Sinai :
» Count the Levites by households and families . Count every male who is at least one month old . «

This clan was to camp on the north side of the Tent , with Zuriel son of Abihail as leader of the clan .
It was the duty of the Merarites to be in charge of the framework of the inner tent , the crossbars , posts , sockets , and all the equipment . They took care of these things .
They were responsible for the posts for the surrounding courtyard , the bases , pegs , and ropes .
Moses , Aaron , and his sons put up their tents on the east side in front of the tent of meeting . They were in charge of the holy place on behalf of the Israelites . Anyone else who tried to do the Levites’ duties had to be put to death .
The grand total of Levites that Moses and Aaron counted at Jehovah’s command , by families , every male who was at least one month old , was twenty-two thousand .
Jehovah said to Moses : » Register every firstborn male of the Israelites who is at least one month old , and make a list of their names .
» I am Jehovah . Take the Levites for me to be substitutes for all firstborn Israelites . Also take the animals of the Levites to be substitutes for all firstborn animals of the Israelites . «
Moses registered all the firstborn Israelites as Jehovah commanded him .
The total of all the firstborn males at least one month old was twenty-two thousand two hundred and seventy three . They were listed by name .
Jehovah said to Moses :
» Take the Levites to be substitutes for all the firstborn Israelites and the animals of the Levites to be substitutes for their animals . The Levites will be mine . I am Jehovah .

» It will cost you two ounces of silver per person , using the standard weight of the holy place , to buy them back .

Moses took this ransom money from the Israelites who outnumbered the Levites .
The silver Moses collected for the firstborn Israelites weighed thirty-four pounds using the standard weight of the holy place .
Then Moses did what Jehovah said and gave Aaron and his sons this ransom money as he had been commanded .
Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron :
» Take a census of the Levites who are descended from Kohath . List them by families and households .
» Register all the men between the ages of thirty and fifty who are qualified to work at the tent of meeting .
» This is the work the Kohathites will do in the tent of meeting : They will take care of the most holy things .
» When the camp is to move , Aaron and his sons will go in and take down the canopy that hangs over the Ark containing the words of God’s Covenant . First they will cover the Ark with the canopy .
» Over this they will put a covering of fine leather . On top of that they will spread a cloth made entirely of violet material . Then they will put the poles in place .
» They will spread a violet cloth over the table of the presence and put on it the plates , dishes , bowls , and pitchers for the wine offerings . The bread that is always in Jehovah’s presence will also be on it .
» They will spread a bright red cloth over everything on the table . They will then cover all this with fine leather . Then they will put the poles in place .
» They will use a violet cloth to cover the lamp stand , as well as the lamps , snuffers , trays , and all the containers for the olive oil used in the lamps .

» Eleazar , son of the priest Aaron , will be in charge of the oil for the lamps , the sweet-smelling incense , the daily grain offering , and the anointing oil . He is in charge of the whole tent and everything in it , the holy place and its contents . «
Jehovah continued to speak to Moses and Aaron :
» Do not let the Kohathite families from Levi’s tribe be destroyed .
» This is what you must do so that they will not die when they come near the most holy things : Aaron and his sons will go into the holy place and tell each man what he will do and what he will carry .
» However the Kohathites must not go in to look at the holy things , even for a moment , or they will die . «
Jehovah said to Moses :
» Take a census of the Gershonites . List them by households and families .
» Register all the men between the ages of thirty and fifty who are qualified to serve at the tent of meeting .
» This is what the Gershonite families will do and what they will carry :
» They will carry the sheets that are part of the inner tent and the tent of meeting . They will also carry the inner cover for the tent of meeting , the outer cover of fine leather that goes over it , the screen for the entrance to the tent of meeting ,
the curtains for the courtyard around the tent and the altar , the screen for the entrance to the courtyard , the ropes , and all the equipment used to set up the curtains . The Gershonites will do everything that needs to be done with these things .

» Command the Israelites to send outside the camp anyone who has a serious skin disease or a discharge or anyone who is unclean from touching a dead body .
» Send all of these unclean men and women outside the camp . They must not make this camp where I live among you unclean . «
Thus the Israelites did as Jehovah told Moses . They sent these unclean people outside the camp .
Jehovah said to Moses :
» Tell the Israelites : ‘ If you do something wrong to another person , you have been unfaithful to Jehovah . When you realize your guilt ,
you must confess your sin , pay in full for what you did wrong , add one-fifth to it , and give it to the person who was wronged .
» ‘ There may be no heir to whom the payment can be made . In that case , the payment for what you did wrong must be given to Jehovah for the priest to use . This payment is in addition to the ram that is used to pay compensation for the wrongdoing makes peace with Jehovah .
» ‘ Any contribution over and above the holy offerings that the Israelites bring to the priest belongs to the priest .
» ‘ Each person’s holy offerings will belong to that person . Everything given to the priest will belong to the priest . ’ «
Jehovah continued to speak to Moses :
» Speak to the Israelites and say : ‘ A man’s wife may have been unfaithful to him
and may have had sexual intercourse with another man without her husband’s knowledge . She may have kept it secret if there were no witnesses to accuse her and she was not caught in the act .
» ‘ A husband may have a fit of jealousy and suspect his wife , whether she was actually unfaithful or not .
» ‘ He must then take his wife to the priest along with eight cups of barley flour as an offering for her . He must not pour olive oil on the flour or put frankincense on it , since it is a grain offering brought because of the husband’s jealousy . It is an offering used for a confession , to remind someone of a sin that was committed .
» ‘ The priest will have the woman come forward and stand in Jehovah’s presence .
» ‘ The priest will then take holy water in a piece of pottery and put some dust from the floor of the tent into the water .
» ‘ The priest will bring the woman into Jehovah’s presence and loosen her hair . In her hands he will put the offering used for a confession , that is , the grain offering brought because of the husband’s jealousy . The priest will hold the bitter water that can bring a curse in his hands .
» ‘ The priest will say to her : ‘ If no other man has had sexual intercourse with you and you have not been unfaithful to your husband , you are not guilty . This bitter water that can bring a curse will not harm you .
» ‘ If you have indeed been unfaithful and have had sexual intercourse with another man ,
» ‘ Jehovah will make you an example for your people to see what happens when the curse of this oath comes true : Jehovah will make your uterus drop and your stomach swell . Then the priest will administer the oath and the curse by saying :
» ‘ May this water that can bring a curse go into your body and make your stomach swell and your uterus drop ! ’ « Then the woman will say : » Amen ! « » Amen ! «
» The priest will write these curses on a scroll and wash them off into the bitter water .
» He will have the woman drink the bitter water that can bring the curse . This water will go into her and become bitter .
» The priest will take the grain offering she was holding . He will present it to Jehovah , and bring it to the altar .
» The priest will take a handful of the grain offering as a memorial portion and burn it on the altar . Then he will have the woman drink the water .
» If she has become unclean by being unfaithful to her husband , the water that can bring the curse will go into her and become bitter . Her stomach will swell , her uterus will drop , and she will become cursed among her people .
» However if the woman is not unclean and is pure , she is not guilty and will be able to have children .
» These are the instructions for how to deal with jealousy . They tell you what to do when a woman is unfaithful to her husband and becomes unclean .
» They also tell you what to do when a husband has a fit of jealousy and is suspicious of his wife . He will make his wife stand in Jehovah’s presence . The priest will do everything these instructions tell him to do .
» The husband is not guilty of doing anything wrong . But the woman will suffer the consequences of her sin . «
Jehovah said to Moses :
» Tell the Israelites : ‘ A man or a woman may make a special vow to live as a Nazirite dedicated to Jehovah .
» ‘ Nazirites must never drink wine , liquor , vinegar made from wine or liquor , or any kind of grape juice . They must never eat fresh grapes or raisins .
» ‘ As long as they are Nazirites they must never eat anything that comes from a grapevine , not even grape seeds or skins .
» ‘ As long as they are under the Nazirite vow no razor may touch their heads . During the entire time that they are dedicated to Jehovah as Nazirites , they will be holy . They must let their hair grow long .
» ‘ While they are dedicated to Jehovah as Nazirites , they must never go near a dead body .
» ‘ Even if their own father , mother , brother , or sister dies , they must not make themselves unclean by going near them . Nazarites show their vow to God with their long hair .
» ‘ As long as they are Nazirites , they will be holy to Jehovah .
» ‘ Someone might suddenly drop dead next to a Nazirite and make the Nazirite’s hair unclean . Seven days later he must shave his head in order to be declared clean .
» ‘ The eighth day he must bring two mourning doves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting .
» ‘ The priest will sacrifice one as an offering for sin and the other one as a burnt offering . The priest will pay compensation for the wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah for the person who touched the dead body . That same day the person must dedicate his head again .
» ‘ Once again he will dedicate himself to Jehovah as a Nazirite for the same length of time as before . He must bring a one-year-old male lamb as an offering for guilt . The first time period will not count . He has to start over from when he became unclean .
» ‘ These are the instructions for Nazirites to complete their vows : They must come to the entrance of the tent of meeting .
» ‘ They are to bring these offerings to Jehovah : a one-year-old male lamb as a burnt offering , a one-year-old female lamb as an offering for sin , and a ram as a fellowship offering . All of these animals must have no defects .
» ‘ They must also bring a basket of unleavened bread containing some rings of bread made with olive oil and wafers of unleavened bread brushed with olive oil , along with other grain offerings and wine offerings .
» ‘ The priest will bring these offerings to Jehovah . He will make the offering for sin and the burnt offering .
» ‘ He will sacrifice the ram as a fellowship offering to Jehovah . He will offer the basket of unleavened bread along with it , and make the grain offerings and wine offerings .
» ‘ The Nazirites will shave their heads at the entrance to the tent of meeting . Then they will take the hair as proof that they had made this vow , and put it on the fire under the fellowship offering .
» ‘ The priest will take one of the shoulders from a boiled ram , one ring of unleavened bread from the basket , and one wafer of unleavened bread and hand them to the Nazirites after they have shaved off their hair .
» ‘ The priest will present them as an offering to Jehovah . They are holy and belong to the priest , along with the ram’s breast that is presented and the thigh that is given . After that , the Nazirites may drink wine . ’ «
» These are the instructions for those who have vowed to bring their offerings to Jehovah as Nazirites . They must bring these offerings in addition to anything else they can afford . They must fulfill the requirements of these instructions for Nazirites and finish whatever they vowed to do . «
Jehovah said to Moses :
» Tell Aaron and his sons : ‘ This is how you will bless the Israelites . Say to them :
» ‘ » Jehovah will bless you and watch over you . « ’ «
» ‘ » Jehovah will smile on you and be kind to you .
» ‘ » Jehovah will look on you with favor and give you peace !
» ‘ » Whenever they use my name to bless the Israelites , I will bless them . « ’ «
Moses finished setting up the tent . He anointed it and dedicated it and all the furnishings . He also anointed and dedicated the altar and all the utensils .
The leaders of Israel , the heads of the households , those tribal leaders who helped in the census came to give their offerings .
They brought these gifts to Jehovah : six freight wagons and twelve oxen , one wagon from every two leaders and one ox from each leader . They brought them in front of the tent .
Jehovah said to Moses :
» Accept these gifts from them to use in the work done for the tent of meeting . Give them to the Levites to use where they need them for their work . «
Moses took the wagons and the oxen and gave them to the Levites .
He gave two wagons and four oxen to the Gershonites for the work they had to do .
He gave four wagons and eight oxen to the Merarites for the work they had to do under the direction of Ithamar , son of the priest Aaron .
However Moses gave none of these gifts to the Kohathites , because they took care of the holy things . They had to carry the holy things on their own shoulders .
The leaders also brought offerings for the dedication of the altar when it was anointed . They presented their gifts in front of the altar .

When Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with Jehovah , he heard the voice speaking to him from above the throne of mercy on the Ark containing the words of God’s Covenant , from between the two cherubim . This is how Jehovah spoke with Moses .
Jehovah said to Moses :
» Speak to Aaron and tell him : ‘ When you set up the seven lamps on the lamp stand , they should illuminate the area in front of it . ’ «
So Aaron set up the lamps on the lamp stand to illuminate the area in front of it , as Jehovah commanded Moses .
This is how the lamp stand was made : The whole lamp stand , from top to bottom , was hammered out of gold . It was made exactly like the one Jehovah had shown Moses .
Jehovah said to Moses :
» Separate the Levites from the rest of the Israelites . Make them clean .
» This is what you must do to make them clean : Sprinkle them with water to take away their sins . Make them shave their whole bodies and wash their clothes . Then they will be clean .
» They must take a young bull and the grain offering of flour mixed with olive oil that is offered with it . You must take a second young bull as an offering for sin .
» Bring the Levites to the front of the tent of meeting . Assemble the whole congregation of Israel .
» Then bring the Levites into Jehovah’s presence , and the Israelites will place their hands on them .
» Aaron will present the Levites to Jehovah as an offering from the Israelites . Then they will be ready to do Jehovah’s work .
» The Levites will place their hands on the heads of the young bulls . Sacrifice one of them as an offering for sin and the other one as a burnt offering to Jehovah . These sacrifices will pay compensation for wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah for the Levites .
» Make the Levites stand in front of Aaron and his sons , and present them as an offering to Jehovah .
» In this way you will separate the Levites from the other Israelites . The Levites will be mine .
» Once you have made them clean and presented them as an offering , the Levites may come and do their work at the tent of meeting .
» They will be the only Israelites given to me . I have taken them to be mine as substitutes for every firstborn male offspring of the Israelites .
» When I killed all the first-born in Egypt , I consecrated as my own the oldest son of each Israelite family and the first-born of every animal .
» I am now taking the Levites instead of all the first-born of the Israelites .
» I assign the Levites to Aaron and his sons , as a gift from the Israelites . They are to work in the tent for the people of Israel and to protect the Israelites from the disaster that would strike them if they came too near the Holy Place . «
Moses , Aaron , and all the people of Israel dedicated the Levites , as Jehovah commanded Moses .
So the Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes . Aaron dedicated them as a special gift to Jehovah . He also performed the ritual of purification for them .
The people did everything Jehovah commanded Moses concerning the Levites . Thus the Levites were qualified to work in the tent under Aaron and his sons .
Jehovah said to Moses :
» From the age of twenty-five each Levite shall perform his duties in the tent of my presence ,
» They must retire from active service when they are fifty years old .
» They may assist the other Levites in their duties at the tent of meeting . But they may not do any regular work . This is how you will handle the Levites’ duties . «
Jehovah spoke to Moses in the Desert of Sinai in the first month of the second year after the Israelites left Egypt . He said :
» The Israelites should celebrate the Passover at the same time every year .
» You must celebrate it on the fourteenth day of this month at dusk . Follow all the rules and regulations for the celebration of the Passover . «
So Moses told the Israelites to celebrate the Passover .
They celebrated it on the fourteenth day of the first month at dusk while they were in the Desert of Sinai . The Israelites did everything as Jehovah commanded Moses .
There were some men who had become unclean from touching a dead body . They could not celebrate the Passover that day . They went to Moses and Aaron .
They said : » We are unclean because we touched a dead body . Why are we prevented from making our offerings to Jehovah at the same time the rest of the Israelites bring their offerings ? «
Moses answered : » Wait here until I find out what Jehovah commands you to do . «
Jehovah said to Moses , » Tell the Israelites :
» ‘ Should you or any of your descendants be unclean from touching a dead body or away on a long trip . You may still celebrate the Passover .
» ‘ You will celebrate it on the fourteenth day of the second month at dusk . Eat the Passover animal along with unleavened bread and bitter herbs .
» ‘ Never leave any of the meat until morning or break any of the animal’s bones . Follow all the rules for the Passover when you celebrate it .
» ‘ If you are clean and not on a trip and yet do not bother to celebrate the Passover , you must be excluded from the people . You did not bring your offering to Jehovah at the right time . You must suffer the consequences for your sin .
» ‘ Foreigners living with you may want to celebrate Jehovah’s Passover . They must follow these same rules and regulations . The same rules will apply to foreigners and native-born Israelites . ’ «
That day the tent of the words of God’s Covenant was set up . The column of smoke covered it . The smoke over the tent glowed like fire from evening until morning .
The smoke always glowed this way . At night the smoke that covered the tent glowed like fire .
When the smoke moved from the tent the Israelites would break camp . Wherever it stopped the Israelites would set up camp .
The Israelites would break camp or set up camp at Jehovah’s command . They stayed at the place where the column of smoke stayed over the tent .
When the smoke stayed over the tent for a long time , the Israelites obeyed Jehovah’s command and did not break camp .
The same thing happened when the smoke stayed only a few days over the tent : At Jehovah’s command they would set up camp , and at his command they would break camp .
Sometimes the column of smoke stayed only from evening until morning . They broke camp when the smoke moved in the morning . Day or night , when the smoke moved , they broke camp .
Whether it was two days , a month , or a year , as long as the column of smoke stayed over the tent , the Israelites stayed in the same place . But when the smoke moved , they would break camp and move .
At Jehovah’s command they set up camp , and at his command they broke camp . They obeyed the command Jehovah gave through Moses .
Jehovah said to Moses :
» Make two trumpets of hammered silver to use for calling the people together and for breaking camp .
» When long blasts are sounded on both trumpets , the whole community is to gather around you at the entrance to the tent of my presence .
» When only one trumpet is sounded , then only the leaders of the clans are to gather around you .
» When short blasts are sounded , the tribes camped on the east will move out .
» When short blasts are sounded a second time , the tribes on the south will move out . So short blasts are to be sounded to break camp ,
» Long blasts are to be sounded to call the congregation together .
» Aaron’s sons the priests are to blow the trumpets . The following rule is to be observed for all time to come .
» When there is war in your land and you defend yourselves against an enemy attack , sound the signal for battle on these trumpets . I , Jehovah your God , will help you and save you from your enemies .
» Joyful occasions such as your New Moon Festivals and your other religious festivals , you are to blow the trumpets when you present your burnt offerings and your fellowship offerings . Then I will help you . I AM JEHOVAH YOUR GOD ! «
The cloud over the tent of Jehovah’s presence lifted the twentieth day of the second month in the second year after the people left Egypt .
At last the Israelites started on their journey out of the Sinai Desert . The cloud came to rest in the wilderness of Paran .
Jehovah gave the command through Moses for them to march .
They were in the same order each time they moved . Those under the banner of the division led by the tribe of Judah started out first , company by company , with Nahshon son of Amminadab in command .
Nethanel son of Zuar was in command of the tribe of Issachar .
Eliab son of Helon was in command of the tribe of Zebulun .
Then the tent would be taken down . The clans of Gershon and Merari carried it .
Next , the banner of the division led by the tribe of Reuben would start out , company by company . Elizur son of Shedeur was in command .
Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was in command of the tribe of Simeon ,
and Eliasaph son of Deuel was in command of the tribe of Gad .
The Levite clan of Kohath started the march . They carried the sacred objects . By the time they arrived at the next camp , the tent had been set up again .
Next , the banner of the division led by the tribe of Ephraim would start out , company by company , with Elishama son of Ammihud in command .
Gamaliel son of Pedahzur commanded the tribe of Manasseh .
Abidan son of Gideoni commanded the tribe of Benjamin .
Finally , the banner of the division led by the tribe of Dan , serving as the rear guard of all the divisions , started out , company by company . Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai was in command .
Pagiel son of Ochran commanded the tribe of Asher .
Ahira son of Enan commanded the tribe of Naphtali .
This was the order of march , company by company , when the Israelites broke camp and set out .
Moses said to his brother-in-law Hobab son of Jethro the Midianite : We are about to start out for the place Jehovah said he would give us . He promised to make Israel prosperous , so come with us , and we will share our prosperity with you .
Hobab answered : » No , I am going back to my native land . «
« Please do not leave us , « Moses said . » You know where we can camp in the desert . You can be our guide .
» If you come with us , we will share with you all the blessings that Jehovah gives us . «
The people left Sinai , the holy mountain . They traveled three days . Jehovah’s Ark of the Covenant always went ahead of them to find a place for them to camp .
They moved camp to camp with the cloud of Jehovah over them by day .
When the Ark of the Covenant started out , Moses would say : » ARISE , JEHOVAH ; scatter your enemies and put to flight those who hate you ! «
And when it stopped , he would say : » RETURN , O JEHOVAH , to the countless thousands of Israel ! «
The people complained out loud to Jehovah about their troubles . Jehovah heard them and he became angry . Fire from Jehovah burned among them . It destroyed some people on the outskirts of the camp .
The people cried out to Moses . Moses prayed to Jehovah ! And the fire died down .
That place was called Taberah Fire because fire from Jehovah burned among them there .
Some foreigners among the Israelites had a strong craving for other kinds of food . Even the Israelites cried again and said : » If only we had meat to eat !
» Remember all the free fish we ate in Egypt and the cucumbers , watermelons , leeks , onions , and garlic we had ?
» Now we have lost our appetite ! Everywhere we look there is nothing but manna ! «
Manna was small like coriander seeds and looked like resin .
The people would gather it and then grind it in a hand mill or crush it in a mortar . They would cook it in a pot or make round loaves of bread out of it . It tasted like rich sweet pastry made with oil .
When dew fell on the camp at night , manna fell with it .
Moses heard people from every family cry at the entrance to their tents . Jehovah became very angry . Moses did not like it either .
So he asked : » Jehovah , why have you brought me this trouble ? How have I displeased you that you put the burden of all these people on me ?
» Am I their mother ? Did I give birth to them ? Are you really asking me to carry them in my arms , as a nurse carries a baby , all the way to the land you promised their ancestors with an oath ?
» Where can I get meat for all these people ? They continually cry for me to give them meat to eat .
» I am not able to take care of all these people by myself . This is too much work for me !
» If you treat me like this have pity on me and kill me . That way I will not have to endure my shame any longer . «
Jehovah replied to Moses : » Assemble seventy respected men who are recognized as elders of the people . Bring them to me at the tent of my presence , and tell them to stand there beside you .
» I will come down and speak with you there . I will take some of the spirit I have given and give it to them . Then they can help you bear the responsibility for these people . You will not have to bear it alone .
» Tell the people : ‘ Purify yourselves for tomorrow . You will have meat to eat ! Jehovah has heard you whining and saying that you wished you had some meat and that you were better off in Egypt . Jehovah will now give you meat , and you will have to eat it .
» ‘ You will have to eat it not just for one or two days , or five , or ten , or even twenty days .
» ‘ You will eat it for a whole month , until it comes out of your nose , until you are sick of it . This will happen because you have rejected Jehovah who is here among you and have complained to him that you should not have left Egypt . ’ «
Moses said to Jehovah : » Here I am leading six hundred thousand people , and you say that you will give them enough meat for a month ? «
» Could enough cattle and sheep even be killed to satisfy them ? Are all the fish in the sea enough for them ?
» Is there a limit to my power ? « Jehovah answered . » You will soon see whether what I have said will happen or not ! «
Thus Moses went out and told the people what Jehovah said . He assembled seventy of the leaders and placed them around the tent .
Jehovah came down in the cloud and spoke to him . He took some of the spirit he had given to Moses and gave it to the seventy elders . When the Spirit came on them , they began to shout like prophets , but not for long .
Two of the seventy elders , Eldad and Medad , stayed in the camp and did not go out to the tent . There in the camp the Spirit came on them , and they too began to shout like prophets .
A young man ran out to tell Moses what Eldad and Medad were doing .
Joshua son of Nun , who had been Moses’ helper since he was a young man , spoke up and said to Moses : » Stop them , sir ! «
Moses asked him : » Do you think you need to stand up for me ? I wish all Jehovah’s people were prophets and that Jehovah would put his Spirit on them ! «
Then Moses and the elders of Israel went back to the camp .
Jehovah sent a wind from the sea that brought quails and dropped them all around the camp . There were quails on the ground about three feet deep as far as you could walk in a day in any direction .
All that day and night and all the next day the people went out and gathered the quails . No one gathered less than sixty bushels . Then they spread the quails out all around the camp .
While the meat was still in their mouths , before they had even had a chance to chew it , Jehovah became angry with the people and struck them with a severe plague .
That place was called Kibroth Hattaavah Graves of Those Who Craved Meat because they buried the people who had a strong craving for meat there .
From Kibroth Hattaavah the people moved to Hazeroth , where they stayed .
Miriam and Aaron criticized Moses because he was married to a Cushite woman from Sudan .
They asked : » Did Jehovah speak only through Moses ? Did he not also speak through us ? Jehovah heard their complaint .
Moses was a very humble meek man . He was more humble than anyone else on earth .
Suddenly , Jehovah said to Moses , Aaron , and Miriam : » All three of you come to the tent of meeting . « So all three of them went to the tent .
Then Jehovah came down in the column of smoke and stood at the entrance to the tent . He called to Aaron and Miriam . They both came forward .
He said : » Listen to my words : ‘ When there are prophets of Jehovah among you , I make myself known to them in visions or speak to them in dreams .
» ‘ But this is not the way I treat my servant Moses . He is the most faithful person in my household .
» ‘ I speak with him face to face . I speak plainly and not in riddles . He even sees the form of Jehovah . Why were you not afraid to criticize my servant Moses ? ’ «
Jehovah was angry with them , so he left .
After the smoke left the tent , Miriam was covered with an infectious skin disease . She was as white as snow . Aaron turned to her and saw she was covered with the disease .
He said to Moses : » Please , do not make us suffer this punishment for our foolish sin .
» Do not let her become like something born dead with half its flesh eaten away . «
Therefore Moses cried out to Jehovah : » O God , heal her ! «
Jehovah answered : » If her father had spit in her face , she would have to bear her disgrace for seven days . So let her be shut out of the camp for a week , and after that she can be brought back in . «
Miriam was shut out of the camp for seven days . The people did not move on until she was brought back in .
Then they left Hazeroth and set up camp in the wilderness of Paran .
Jehovah said to Moses :
» Choose one of the leaders from each of the twelve tribes and send them as spies to explore the land of Canaan , which I am giving to the Israelites . «
According to Jehovah’s command , Moses sent these men from the Desert of Paran . All of them were leaders of the Israelites .
These are their names : Shammua , son of Zaccur , from the tribe of Reuben ,
Shaphat , son of Hori , from the tribe of Simeon ;
Caleb , son of Jephunneh , from the tribe of Judah ;
Igal , son of Joseph , from the tribe of Issachar ;
Hoshea , son of Nun , from the tribe of Ephraim ;
Palti , son of Raphu , from the tribe of Benjamin ;
Gaddiel , son of Sodi , from the tribe of Zebulun ;
Gaddi , son of Susi , from the tribe of Joseph , that is , the tribe of Manasseh ;
Ammiel , son of Gemalli , from the tribe of Dan ;
Sethur , son of Michael , from the tribe of Asher ;
Nahbi , son of Vophsi , from the tribe of Naphtali ;
and Geuel , son of Machi , from the tribe of Gad .
These are the names of the men Moses sent to explore the land . But Moses gave Hoshea , son of Nun , the name Joshua .
When Moses sent them to explore Canaan , he told them : » Go through the Negev and then into the mountain region .
» See what the land is like and whether the people there are strong or weak , few or many .
» Is the land they live in good or bad ? Do their cities have walls around them or not ?
» Is the soil rich or poor ? Does the land have trees or not ? Do your best to bring back some fruit from the land . « It was the season when grapes were beginning to ripen .
So they spied on the land from the wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob , at Lebo-hamath .
When they went to the Negev , they came to Hebron where Ahiman , Sheshai and Talmai , the descendants of Anak were . Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt .
At Eshcol Valley they cut off a branch with only one bunch of grapes on it . They carried it on a pole between two of them . They also brought some pomegranates and figs .
So they called that valley Eshcol Bunch of Grapes because of the bunch of grapes the Israelites cut off there .
Forty days later they returned from exploring the land .
They returned to Moses , Aaron , and the whole congregation of Israel at Kadesh in the Desert of Paran . They gave their report and showed them the fruit from the land .
This is their report to Moses : » We went to the land where you sent us . It really is a land flowing with milk and honey . Here is some of its fruit .
» The people who live there are strong . The cities have walls and are very large . We even saw the descendants of Anak there .
» The Amalekites live in the Negev . The Hittites , Jebusites , and Amorites live in the mountain region . The Canaanites live along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea and all along the Jordan River . «
Caleb told the people to be quiet and listen to Moses . Caleb said : » Let us go now and take possession of the land . We should be more than able to conquer it . «
The men who had gone with him said : » We cannot attack those people ! They are too strong for us !
» They spread lies among the Israelites about the land they had explored . They said : The land we explored is one that devours those who live there . All the people we saw there are very tall .
» We saw Nephilim there . The descendants of Anak are Nephilim . We felt as small as grasshoppers . That is no doubt how we must have looked to them . «
All the Israelite congregation raised their voices and cried out loud all that night .
They complained to Moses and Aaron : » If only we had died in Egypt or in this desert !
» Why is Jehovah bringing us to this land ? Is it just to have us die in battle ? Our wives and children will be taken as prisoners of war ! Would it not be better for us to go back to Egypt ? «
They said to each other : » Let us choose a leader and go back to Egypt . «
Immediately , Moses and Aaron bowed with their faces touching the ground in front of the whole congregation of Israel assembled there .
At the same time , two of those who had explored the land , Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh , tore their clothes in despair .
They said to the entire congregation of Israel : » The land we explored is very good .
» If Jehovah is pleased with us , he will take us there and give us that rich and fertile land .
» Do not rebel against Jehovah . Do not be afraid of the people who live there . We will conquer them easily . Jehovah is with us and has defeated the gods who protected them . Do not be afraid . «
The whole congregation threatened to stone them to death . Then suddenly the people saw the dazzling light of Jehovah’s presence glory splendor appear over the tent .
Jehovah said to Moses : » How much longer will these people reject me ? How much longer will they refuse to trust in me , even though I have performed many miracles among them ?
» I will send an epidemic and destroy them . I will make you the father of a nation that is larger and more powerful than they are ! «
Moses said to Jehovah : » You brought these people out of Egypt by your power . When the Egyptians hear what you have done to your people ,
they will tell it to the people who live in this land . These people have already heard that you , Jehovah , are with us , that you appear in plain sight when your cloud stops over us , and that you go before us in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night .
» But if you kill all these people at the same time the nations who have heard these reports about you will say ,
» Jehovah was not able to bring these people into the land he promised them , so he slaughtered them in the desert .
» Jehovah , let your power be as great as when you said ,
» Jehovah is patient , forever loving ; He forgives wrongdoing and disobedience . He never lets the guilty go unpunished . In fact he punishes children for their parents’ sins to the third and fourth generation .
» By your great love , please forgive these people’s sins , as you have forgiven them from the time they left Egypt until now . «
Jehovah said : » I forgive them , as you have asked .
» But as I live and as the glory of Jehovah fills the whole earth , I solemnly swear that
none of the people who saw my glory and the miraculous signs I did in Egypt and in the desert will see the land I promised their ancestors . They have tested me now ten times and refused to obey me .
» None of those who treat me with contempt will see it !
» My servant Caleb has a different attitude and has wholeheartedly followed me , I will bring him to the land he already explored . His descendants will possess it .
» The Amalekites and Canaanites are living in the valleys . Tomorrow you must turn around , go back into the desert . Follow the road that goes to the Red Sea . «
Then Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron :
» How long must I put up with this wicked congregation that keeps complaining about me ? I have heard the complaints the Israelites are making about me .
» Therefore tell them : ‘ As I live , declares Jehovah , I solemnly swear I will do everything to you that you said I would do .
» ‘ Your bodies will drop dead in this desert . All of you who are at least twenty years old , who were registered and listed , and who complained about me will die .
» ‘ I raised my hand and swore an oath to give you this land to live in . But none of you will enter it except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun .
» ‘ You said your children would be taken as prisoners of war . Instead , I will bring them into the land you rejected , and they will enjoy it .
» ‘ But your bodies will drop dead in this desert .
» ‘ Your children will be shepherds in the desert for forty years . They will suffer for your unfaithfulness until the last of your bodies lies dead in the desert .
» ‘ You explored the land for forty days . So for forty years , one year for each day , you will suffer for your sins and know what it means for me to be against you . ’
» ‘ I , Jehovah , have spoken . I swear I will do these things to all the people in this whole wicked congregation . For they have joined forces against me . They will meet their end in this desert . Here they will die ! ’ «
The men Moses sent to explore the land died in front of Jehovah from a plague .
They died because they had returned and made the whole community complain about Moses . They spread lies about the land .
Of all the men who went to explore the land , only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh survived .
Moses told these things to all the Israelites . The people mourned bitterly , as if someone had died .
Early the next morning they headed into the mountains . They said : » We have sinned . Now we will go to the place Jehovah promised . «
Moses asked : » Why are you disobeying Jehovah’s command ? Your plan will not work !
» Do not go ! Your enemies will defeat you because Jehovah is not with you .
» The Amalekites and Canaanites are there . You will die in battle . Now that you have turned away from Jehovah , he will not be with you . «
But they headed into the mountains anyway . The Ark of the Jehovah’s promise and Moses stayed in the camp .
The Amalekites and Canaanites who lived there came down from those mountains , attacked the Israelites , and defeated them at Hormah .
Jehovah said to Moses :
Speak to the Israelites and tell them : » Once you are settled in the land I am giving you ,
you must bring offerings by fire to Jehovah . They may be burnt offerings or any other kind of sacrifice . They may be offered to fulfill a vow , as a freewill offering , or as one of your festival offerings . They may be cattle , sheep , or goats . These are offerings that are a soothing pleasant restful aroma to Jehovah .
» Whoever presents the offering must also give Jehovah a grain offering of eight cups of flour mixed with one quart of oil .
» With each sheep or goat for the burnt offering or any other sacrifice , also give an offering of one quart of wine .
» With a ram , give a grain offering of sixteen cups of flour mixed with one and one quarter quarts of oil
and an offering of one and one quarter quarts of wine . Offer them as a soothing aroma to Jehovah .
» When you sacrifice a young bull as a burnt offering to Jehovah or make any other kind of sacrifice to keep a vow or as a fellowship offering .
» Offer with the young bull a grain offering of twenty-four cups of flour mixed with two quarts of oil .
» Also give an offering of two quarts of wine . It is an offering by fire , a soothing aroma to Jehovah .
» Do this for each bull , each ram , and each sheep or goat .
» Do it for each animal , however many you sacrifice .
» All native-born Israelites must do it this way when they bring an offering by fire , a soothing aroma to Jehovah .
» Make a food offering , an odor that pleases Jehovah . If foreigners live among you , whether on a temporary or a permanent basis , they are to observe the same regulations .
» For all time to come , the same rules are binding on you and on the foreigners who live among you . You and they are alike in Jehovah’s sight .
» The same laws and regulations apply to you and to them . «
Jehovah gave Moses
the following regulations for the people of Israel . They are to observe them in the land he was going to give them .
» When any food produced there is eaten , some of it is to be set aside as a special contribution to Jehovah .
» When you bake bread , the first loaf of the first bread made from the new grain is to be presented as a special contribution to Jehovah . This is to be presented in the same way as the special contribution you make from the grain you thresh .
» For all time to come , this special gift is to be given to Jehovah from the bread you bake .
» Suppose someone unintentionally fails to keep some of these regulations Jehovah gave Moses .
» Also suppose that in the future the congregation fails to do everything Jehovah commanded through Moses .
» If the mistake was made because of the ignorance of the congregation , they are to offer a bull as a burnt offering , an odor that pleases Jehovah . Use the proper grain offering and wine offering . In addition , they are to offer a male goat as a sin offering .
» The priest will perform the ritual of purification for the congregation . They will be forgiven since the mistake was unintentional and they brought their sin offering as a food offering to Jehovah
» The whole congregation of Israel and the foreigners living among them will be forgiven , because everyone was involved in the mistake .
» If any of you sin unintentionally , you should offer a one-year-old female goat as a sin offering .
» The priest shall perform the ritual of purification at the altar to purify you from your sin . You will be forgiven .
» The same regulation applies to all who unintentionally commit a sin , whether they are native Israelites or resident foreigners .
» Any who sin deliberately , natives or foreigners , are guilty of treating Jehovah with contempt . They shall be put to death .
» They have rejected what Jehovah said and have deliberately broken one of his commandments . They are responsible for their own death . «
One time , while the Israelites were still in the wilderness , a man was found gathering firewood on the Sabbath .
He was taken to Moses , Aaron , and the whole congregation .
They held him in custody until they decided what to do with him .
Jehovah said to Moses : » This man must be put to death . The whole congregation must take him outside the camp and stone him . «
So the whole congregation took him outside the camp and stoned him to death , as Jehovah commanded Moses .
Jehovah said to Moses :
Speak to the Israelites and tell them : » For generations to come they must wear tassels on the corners of their clothes . Each tassel should have violet threads .
» When you look at the threads in the tassel , you will remember all Jehovah’s commandments and obey them . Then you will not do whatever you want and go after whatever you see , as if you were chasing after prostitutes .
» You will remember to obey all my commandments . You will be holy to your God .
» I am Jehovah your God , who brought you out of Egypt to be your God . I am Jehovah your God ! «
Korah son of Izhar , Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab , and On son of Peleth dared to challenge Moses . Korah was a descendant of Kohath and Levi . Dathan , Abiram , and On were descendants of Reuben .
These four men were joined by two hundred and fifty Israelite men , well known leaders of the congregation . The assembly chose them .
They came together to confront Moses and Aaron . They said : » You have gone far enough ! Everyone in the whole congregation is holy . Jehovah is among them . Why do you set yourselves above Jehovah’s assembly ? «
When Moses heard this , he bowed with his face touching the ground .
Then he said to Korah and all his followers : » In the morning Jehovah will show who belongs to him , who is holy . He will have that person come near him . Only the person Jehovah chooses will be allowed to come near him .
» Korah , you and all your followers must do this tomorrow : Take incense burners ,
» Put burning coals and incense in them in Jehovah’s presence . Jehovah will choose the man who is holy . You have gone far enough ! «
Moses also said to Korah : » Listen , you sons of Levi !
» Is it not enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the congregation of Israel ? Jehovah has brought you near to do the work for his tent and stand in front of the community to serve them .
» He brought you and all the other Levites near . But now you demand to be priests .
» You and all your followers have joined forces against Jehovah ! Who is Aaron that you should complain about him ? «
Then Moses sent for Dathan and Abiram , sons of Eliab . But they said : » We will not come !
» Is it not enough that you brought us out of a land flowing with milk and honey only to kill us in the desert ? Do you also have to order us around ?
» You have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey or given us any fields and vineyards to own . Do you think you can still pull the wool over our eyes ? We will not come . «
Moses became angry and said to Jehovah : » Do not accept their offering . I have not taken anything from them , not even a donkey . And I have not mistreated any of them . «
Moses said to Korah : » Tomorrow you and all your followers must come into Jehovah’s presence . Aaron will also be there with you .
» Each man will take his incense burner and put incense in it . They will offer all two hundred and fifty incense burners to Jehovah . Then you and Aaron offer your incense burners . «
So each man took his incense burner . He put burning coals and incense in it and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the tent of meeting .
Korah assembled all his followers who opposed Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the tent of meeting . The glory of Jehovah appeared to the entire group .
Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron :
» Move away from these men . I will destroy them instantly . «
Immediately , they bowed with their faces touching the ground and said : » O God , you are the God who gives the breath of life to everyone ! If one man sins , will you be angry with the entire congregation ? «
Then Jehovah said to Moses :
» Tell the congregation : ‘ Move away from the tents of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram . ’ «
Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram , and the elders of Israel followed him .
He said to the congregation : » Move away from the tents of these wicked men . Do not touch anything that belongs to them , or you ’ ll be swept away because of all their sins . «
So they moved away from the tents of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram . Dathan and Abiram came out and were standing at the entrances to their tents with their wives and children .
Moses said : » This is how you will know that Jehovah sent me to do all these things and that it wasn ’ t my idea :
» If these men die a natural death like all other people Jehovah has not sent me .
» But if Jehovah does something totally new , if the ground opens up , swallows them and everything that belongs to them , and they go down alive to their graves ; then you will know that these men have treated Jehovah with contempt . «
When he finished speaking , the ground under them split ,
and the earth opened up to swallow them , their families , the followers of Korah , and all their property .
They went down alive to their graves with everything that belonged to them . The ground covered them . They disappeared from the assembly .
All the Israelites around them ran away when they heard their screams . They thought the ground would swallow them , also .
Fire came from Jehovah and consumed the two hundred and fifty men who were offering incense .
Then Jehovah said to Moses :
» Tell Eleazar , son of the priest Aaron , to take the incense burners out of the fire and scatter the coals and incense somewhere else . This is because the incense burners have become holy .
» The incense burners of these men who sinned and lost their lives are holy , because they were offered to Jehovah . Hammer them into thin metal sheets to cover the altar . This will be a sign to the Israelites . «
The priest Eleazar took the copper incense burners that had been brought by those who had been burned to death . The incense burners were then hammered into thin metal sheets to cover the altar .
He followed Jehovah’s command given through Moses . The copper-covered altar will remind Israel that no one but a descendant of Aaron may come near to burn incense to Jehovah . Everyone else will die like Korah and his followers .
The next day the whole congregation of Israel complained to Moses and Aaron . They said : » You have killed Jehovah’s people . «
The congregation came together to confront Moses and Aaron . When they turned toward the tent of meeting , they saw the smoke covering it , and the glory of Jehovah appeared .
Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of the tent of meeting .
Jehovah said to Moses :
» Get away from these people , and let me destroy them in an instant ! Immediately , they bowed with their faces touching the ground . «
Moses said to Aaron : » Take your incense burner , put burning coals from the altar and incense in it , and go quickly into the congregation to make peace with Jehovah for the people . Jehovah shows his anger ! A plague has started . «
Aaron took his incense burner , as Moses told him . He ran into the middle of the assembly , because the plague had already begun among the people . He put incense on the incense burner to make peace with Jehovah for the people .
He stood between those who had died and those who were still alive . The plague stopped .
Fourteen thousand seven hundred died from the plague in addition to those who died because of Korah .
By the time Aaron came back to Moses at the entrance to the tent of meeting , the plague had stopped .
Jehovah said to Moses :
» Speak to the Israelites and get twelve staffs from them . Get one from the leader of each of their tribes . Write each man’s name on his staff .
» Write Aaron’s name on the staff for Levi because there must be one staff for the head of each tribe .
» Put them in the tent of meeting where I meet with you , in front of the testimony of my promise .
» The staff from the man I choose will begin to grow . In this way I will silence the frequent complaints the Israelites make against you and Aaron . «
Thus Moses spoke to the Israelites . Their leaders gave him twelve staffs , one from the leader of each of their tribes . Aaron’s staff was among them .
Moses put the staffs in Jehovah’s presence in the tent of the testimony .
The next day Moses went into the tent . He found that Aaron’s staff for the tribe of Levi had not only begun to grow , but it had also blossomed and produced ripe almonds .
Moses brought out the staffs from Jehovah’s presence and showed them to all the Israelites . They looked at them , and each man took his staff .
Jehovah said to Moses : » Put Aaron’s staff in front of the testimony . Keep it there as a sign to warn any other rebels . Then you will stop their complaints about me , and they will not die . «
Moses did exactly what Jehovah commanded him to do .
The Israelites said to Moses : Now we are going to die ! We will perish ! We are all lost !
Anyone who comes near Jehovah’s tent will die ! Are we all going to die ?
Jehovah said to Aaron : » You , your sons , and your family will be responsible for any sins against the holy place . You and your sons will also be responsible for any sins you commit when you work as priests .
» Bring the other Levites from your ancestor’s tribe to join you and help you and your sons serve in front of the tent of the words of my promise .
» They are to fulfill their duties to you and their responsibilities for the tent . However they must not have any contact with sacred objects in the Holy Place or with the altar . If they do , both they and you will be put to death .
» They are to work with you and fulfill their responsibilities for all the service in the tent . No unqualified person may work with you .
» You and your sons alone must fulfill the responsibilities for the Holy Place and the altar . That way my anger will not again break out against the people of Israel .
» I chose the other Levites from among the Israelites to help you . They are a gift given to Jehovah to do the necessary work at the tent of meeting .
» Only you and your sons may do the work of priests , everything done at the altar and under the canopy . This is my gift to you : You may serve me as priests . Anyone else who comes near the holy place to do this work must die . «
Jehovah said to Aaron : » I have placed you in charge of all the contributions given to me . I have given you and your descendants all the holy gifts from the Israelites as your share . These contributions will be yours from generation to generation .
» That part of the most holy offerings that is not burned belongs to you . It may come from a grain offering , an offering for sin , or a guilt offering . Whatever is brought to me , as a most holy offering will belong to you and your sons .
» Eat it in a most holy place . Any male may eat it . You must consider it holy .
» The contributions that come as gifts taken from the offerings presented by the Israelites are also yours . I give these to you , your sons , and your daughters . They will be yours from generation to generation . Anyone in your household who is clean may eat them .
» I also give you the first of the produce they give Jehovah . It is the best of all the olive oil and the best of the new wine and fresh grain .
» The first of all produce harvested in their land that they bring to Jehovah are yours . Anyone in your household who is clean may eat it .
» Anything in Israel that is claimed by Jehovah is yours .
» Every firstborn male , human or animal that is brought to Jehovah is yours . But you must buy back every firstborn son and the firstborn male of any unclean animal .
» When they are one month old , you must buy them back at the fixed price of two ounces of silver using the standard weight of the holy place .
» You must never buy back a firstborn bull , sheep , or goat . They are holy . Throw the blood from these animals against the altar . Burn the fat as an offering by fire , a soothing aroma to Jehovah .
» The meat is yours , like the breast and the right thigh that are presented .
» I have given you , your sons , and your daughters all the holy contributions which the Israelites offer to Jehovah . These contributions will be yours from generation to generation . It is an everlasting promise of salt in Jehovah’s presence for you and your descendants . «
Jehovah said to Aaron : » You will have no land or property of your own as the other Israelites will have . I am your possession and your property among the Israelites .
» I have given the Levites one-tenth of every Israelite’s income . This is in return for the work they do at the tent of meeting .
» The other Israelites must never again come near the tent of meeting . Otherwise , they will suffer the consequences of their sin and die .
» Only the Levites will do the work at the tent of meeting . They are responsible for their own sins . This is a long lasting law for future generations . They will own no property , as the other Israelites will .
» Instead , I will give the Levites what the Israelites contribute to Jehovah , one-tenth of the Israelites’ income . This is why I said about them : They will own no property as the other Israelites do . «
Jehovah said to Moses :
» Speak to the Levites and say to them : ‘ You will take one-tenth of the Israelites’ income that I am giving you as your property . When you do , you must contribute one-tenth of that income as your contribution to Jehovah .
» ‘ Your contribution will be considered to be grain from the threshing floor or juice from the winepress .
» ‘ You will also contribute one-tenth of your income to Jehovah out of all that you receive from the Israelites’ income . You will give Jehovah’s contribution to the priest Aaron .
» ‘ Out of all the gifts you receive , you must contribute the best and holiest parts to Jehovah . ’
» Also tell them : ‘ When you contribute the best part , your contribution will be considered to be produce from the threshing floor or winepress .
» ‘ You and your households may eat it anywhere . This is because it is the wages you receive for your work at the tent of meeting .
» ‘ When you contribute the best part , you will not suffer the consequences of any sin . You will not be dishonoring the holy offerings given by the Israelites , and you will not die . ’ «
Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron :
» This is a requirement of the law Jehovah has commanded : ‘ Tell the Israelites to bring you a red cow that is perfect , with no defects . Also , it must never have worn a yoke .
» ‘ Give it to Eleazar the priest . It must be taken outside the camp and slaughtered in his presence .
» ‘ Eleazar the priest will take some of the blood with his finger and sprinkle it seven times toward the front of the tent of meeting .
» ‘ Then the entire cow , the skin , meat , blood , and excrement , will be burned while he watches .
» ‘ The priest will take some cedar wood , a hyssop sprig , and some red yarn and throw them onto the burning cow .
» ‘ The priest must then wash his clothes and his body . After that , he may go into the camp . But he will be unclean until evening .
» ‘ The person who burned the calf must also wash his clothes and his body . He will be unclean until evening .
» ‘ A man who is clean will collect the ashes from the cow and put them in a clean place outside the camp . They will be kept by the congregation of Israel and used in the water that takes away uncleanness . The cow is an offering for sin .
» ‘ The one who collected the ashes must wash his clothes . He remains unclean until evening . This regulation is valid for all time to come , both for the Israelites and for the foreigners living among them .
» ‘ Those who touch a corpse are ritually unclean for seven days .
» ‘ They must purify themselves with the water for purification on the third day and on the seventh day . Then they will be clean . But if they do not purify themselves on both the third and the seventh day , they will not be clean .
» ‘ Those who touch a corpse and do not purify themselves remain unclean . This is because the water for purification has not been thrown over them . They defile Jehovah’s tent , and they will no longer be considered God’s people .
» ‘ Here are your instructions for when a person dies in a tent : Everyone who goes into the tent and everyone who is in the tent will be unclean for seven days .
» ‘ Every container without a lid fastened on it is unclean .
» ‘ Whoever is outdoors and touches someone who was killed or has died naturally or anyone who touches a human bone or a grave will be unclean for seven days .
» ‘ Do this for people who become unclean from touching a dead body . Put some of the ashes from the red cow that was burned as an offering for sin into a container . Then pour fresh water on them .
» ‘ A person who is clean will take a sprig of hyssop , dip it in the water , and sprinkle the tent , all the furnishings , and all the people who were in the tent with the dead body . He must also sprinkle any person who has touched a human bone or a grave and any person who has touched someone who has been killed or who has died naturally .
» ‘ A person who is clean will sprinkle these types of unclean people on the third day and the seventh day . On the seventh day the clean person will finish taking away their sins . Then they must wash their clothes and bodies . In the evening they will be clean .
» ‘ If the person who becomes unclean does not have his sin taken away , that person must be excluded from the assembly . He has made the holy place of Jehovah unclean . The water to take away uncleanness was not sprinkled on him . He is unclean .
» ‘ This will be a long lasting law for them . He who sprinkles the water to take away uncleanness must wash his clothes . He who touches this water will be unclean until evening .
» ‘ Anything that an unclean person touches becomes unclean . The person who touches it will be unclean until evening . ’ «
In the first month the whole congregation of Israel came into the Desert of Zin , and they stayed at Kadesh . Miriam died and was buried there .
The congregation was without water . So they gathered to confront Moses and Aaron .
The people complained to Moses . They said : » If only we had died when the other Israelites died in Jehovah’s presence !
» Did you bring Jehovah’s assembly into this desert just to have us all die and our animals ?
» Why did you make us leave Egypt and bring us into this terrible place ? This is no place to plant crops . Even figs , grapes , and pomegranates will not grow here . And there is no water to drink ! «
Moses and Aaron went from the assembly to the entrance of the tent of meeting . They bowed with their faces touching the ground . The glory of Jehovah appeared to them .
Jehovah said to Moses :
» Take your staff and you and your brother Aaron gather the congregation . Right before their eyes , tell the rock to give up its water . In this way you will give the congregation water from the rock for them and their animals to drink . «
Moses took his staff out of the tent in Jehovah’s presence as he had been commanded .
Moses and Aaron assembled the congregation in front of the rock and said to them : » Listen , you rebels , must we bring water out of this rock for you ? «
Moses raised his hand and hit the rock twice with the staff . Water came pouring out ! All the people and their animals drank .
Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron : » You did not trust me ! You did not show the Israelites how holy I am ! So you will not bring this congregation into the land I am giving them . «
This was the oasis of Meribah Complaining , where the Israelites complained about Jehovah and where he showed them he was holy .
Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom . He said : » This is what your brother Israel says : ‘ You know all the hardships we have had .
» ‘ Our ancestors went to Egypt . We lived there for many years . The Egyptians mistreated our ancestors and us .
» ‘ We cried to Jehovah for help . He heard our cry and sent an angel , who led us out of Egypt . Now we are at Kadesh , a town at the border of your territory .
» ‘ Please permit us to pass through your land . We , including our cattle , will not leave the road or go into your fields or vineyards . We will not drink from your wells . We will stay on the main king’s road until we are out of your territory . ’ «
But the Edomites answered : » We refuse to let you pass through our country ! If you try , we will march out and attack you . «
The people of Israel said : » We will stay on the main road . If we , or our animals , drink any of your water we will pay for it . All we want is to pass through . «
The Edomites repeated : » We refuse ! « Then they marched out with a powerful army to attack the people of Israel .
The Edomites would not let the Israelites pass through their territory . So the Israelites turned and went another way .
The whole congregation of Israel left Kadesh and arrived at Mount Hor ,
on the border of Edom . There Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron :
» Aaron is not going to enter the land I promised to give to Israel . He is going to die , because the two of you rebelled against my command at Meribah .
» Take Aaron and his son Eleazar to Mount Hor .
» Remove Aaron’s priestly robes and put them on Eleazar . Aaron is going to die there . «
Moses did what Jehovah commanded . They went up Mount Hor in the sight of the entire congregation .
Moses removed Aaron’s priestly robes and put them on Eleazar . There on the top of the mountain Aaron died , and Moses and Eleazar came back down .
The entire congregation learned that Aaron had died . They all mourned for him for thirty days .
The Canaanite king of Arad in the southern part of Canaan heard that the Israelites were coming by way of Atharim . So he attacked them and captured some of them .
Then the Israelites made a vow to Jehovah : » If you will let us conquer these people , we will unconditionally dedicate them and their cities to you and will destroy them . «
Jehovah heard them and helped them conquer the Canaanites . The Israelites completely destroyed them and their cities , and named the place Hormah .
They moved from Mount Hor following the road that goes to the Red Sea . That way they could go around Edom . The people became impatient on the trip
and criticized God and Moses . They said : » Why did you make us leave Egypt only to let us die in the desert ? There is no bread or water , and we cannot stand this awful food ! «
Jehovah sent poisonous snakes among the people . They bit the people , and many of the Israelites died .
The people came to Moses and said : » We sinned when we criticized Jehovah and you . Pray to Jehovah so that he will take the snakes away from us . So Moses prayed for the people . «
Jehovah said to Moses : » Make a snake and put it on a pole . Anyone who is bitten can look at it and live . «
Moses made a copper snake and put it on a pole . People looked at the copper snake after they were bitten and lived .
The Israelites moved and set up camp at Oboth .
After leaving that place , they camped at the ruins of Abarim in the wilderness east of Moabite territory .
Then they camped in Zered Valley .
They moved again and camped on the north side of the Arnon River , in the desert that extends into Amorite territory . The Arnon was the border between the Moabites and the Amorites .
That is why The Book of Jehovah’s Battles speaks of the town of Waheb in the area of Suphah , and the valleys ; the Arnon River ,
and the slope of the valleys that extend to the town of Ar and toward the border of Moab .
From there they went on to a place called Wells , where Jehovah said to Moses : Bring the people together , and I will give them water .
The people of Israel sang this song : » Wells , produce your water ; And we will greet it with a song .
» The well dug by princes and by leaders of the people , dug with a royal scepter and with their walking sticks . They moved from the wilderness to Mattanah ,
and from there they went on to Nahaliel , and from Nahaliel to Bamoth ,
and from Bamoth to the valley in the territory of the Moabites , below the top of Mount Pisgah , looking out over the desert .
» The people of Israel sent messengers to the Amorite king Sihon to say :
» Let us go through your country . We will not go through any of your fields or vineyards or drink any of the water from your wells . We will stay on the king’s highway until we have passed through your territory . «
Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory . Sihon gathered all his troops and came out into the desert to attack Israel . When Sihon’s troops came to Jahaz , they fought against Israel .
Israel defeated them in battle and took possession of their land from the Arnon Valley to the Jabbok River . They stopped at the border of the Ammon because it was fortified .
The Israelites settled in the Amorite towns . They settled in the capital city of Heshbon with its surrounding villages .
King Sihon ruled from Heshbon after defeating the Moabites and taking over their land north of the Arnon River gorge .
That is why the Amorites had written this poem about Heshbon : » Come and rebuild Heshbon , King Sihon’s capital city !
» His armies marched out like fiery flames , burning down the town of Ar and destroying the hills along the Arnon River .
» You Moabites are done for ! Your god Chemosh deserted your people . They were captured , taken away by King Sihon the Amorite .
» We completely defeated Moab . The towns of Heshbon and Dibon , of Nophah and Medeba are ruined and gone . «
After the Israelites settled in the Amorite territory ,
Moses sent some men to explore the town of Jazer . Some time later , the Israelites captured the villages surrounding it and forced out the Amorites who lived there .
They turned around and went by the way of Bashan . Og the king of Bashan went out with all his people for battle at Edrei .
Jehovah said to Moses : » Do not fear him for I have given him into your hand , and all his people and his land . You will do to him as you did to Sihon , king of the Amorites , who lived at Heshbon . «
The Israelites defeated him , his sons , and all his troops , leaving no survivors . They took possession of his land .
The Israelites moved and set up camp across from Jericho . They were on the plains of Moab east of the Jordan River .
Balak , son of Zippor , saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites .
The Moabites were very afraid because there were so many Israelites . Also , the Moabites did not like these people .
So the Moabites said to the leaders of Midian : » All those people will eventually eat up everything around us the same way cattle eat up the grass in a field . At that time Balak , son of Zippor , was king of Moab . «
He sent messengers to summon Balaam , son of Beor , who was at Pethor , on the Euphrates River , in the land where his people lived . Balak’s message was : » A nation has just come here from Egypt . They have spread out all over the countryside and are setting up their camp here in front of me .
» They outnumber us , so please come and put a curse on them for me . Then maybe we will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land . I know that when you pronounce a blessing , people are blessed , and when you pronounce a curse , they are placed under a curse . «
The elders of Moab and Midian left . They took money with them to pay for Balaam’s services . They came to Balaam and told him what Balak had said .
» Spend the night here , « Balaam said to them , » and I will report to you what Jehovah tells me . « So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam .
God came to Balaam and asked : » Who are these men with you ? «
Balaam answered : » Balak , son of King Zippor of Moab , sent them with this message :
» Some people came from Egypt and are spreading out all over the countryside . Now come and curse them for me . Maybe I will be able to fight them and force them out . «
God said to Balaam : » Do not go with them ! Do not curse these people . They are blessed ! «
When Balaam got up in the morning , he said to Balak’s princes : » Go back to your own country . Jehovah has refused to let me go with you . «
The Moabite princes went back to Balak and said : » Balaam refused to come with us . «
Balak sent a larger group of more highly respected princes .
When they came to Balaam they said to him : » This is what Balak son of Zippor says : ‘ Do not let anything keep you from coming to me .
» ‘ I will make sure you are richly rewarded . I will do whatever you ask . Please , come and curse execrate these people for me . ’ «
Balaam answered Balak’s servants : » Even if Balak gave me his palace filled with silver and gold , I could not disobey the command of Jehovah my God no matter whether the request was important or not .
» Now , please stay here tonight , as the others did , and I will find out what else Jehovah may have to tell me . «
That night God came to Balaam and said : » If these men have come to summon you , go with them , but do only what I tell you . «
Balaam got up in the morning and saddled his donkey and left with the Moabite princes .
God became angry that he was going . So the angel of Jehovah stood in the road to stop him . Balaam was riding on his donkey , accompanied by his two servants .
The donkey saw the angel of Jehovah standing in the road with his sword drawn . The donkey turned off the road into a field . Balaam hit the donkey to get it back on the road .
Where the road went through the vineyards , it was narrow , with stonewalls on both sides . Now the angel of Jehovah stood there .
The donkey saw the angel and it moved over against the wall and crushed Balaam’s foot against it . Again Balaam beat the donkey .
Once more the angel moved ahead . He stood in a narrow place where there was no room at all to pass on either side .
This time , when the donkey saw the angel , it lay down . Balaam lost his temper and began to beat the donkey with his stick .
Jehovah gave the donkey the power of speech . The donkey said to Balaam : » What have I done to you ? Why have you beaten me these three times ? «
Balaam answered : » It is because you have made a fool of me ! If I had a sword , I would kill you . «
The donkey replied : » Am I not the same donkey on which you have ridden all your life ? Have I ever treated you like this before ? « » No , « he answered .
Then Jehovah let Balaam see the angel standing there with his sword . Balaam threw himself face down on the ground .
The angel demanded : » Why have you beaten your donkey three times like this ? I have come to bar your way , because you should not be making this journey .
» But your donkey saw me and turned aside three times . If it had not , I would have killed you and spared the donkey . «
Balaam replied : » I have sinned . I did not know that you were standing in the road to oppose me . Now if you think it is wrong for me to go on I will return home . «
But the angel said : » Go on with these men , but say only what I tell you to say . « Thus Balaam went on with them .
Balak heard that Balaam was coming . He went to meet him at Ar , a city on the Arnon River at the border of Moab .
Balak said to him : » Why did you not come when I sent for you the first time ? Did you think I was not able to reward you enough ? «
Balaam answered : » I am here now . But now , what power do I have ? I can say only what God tells me to say . «
Balaam went with Balak to the town of Huzoth .
Balak slaughtered cattle and sheep and gave some of the meat to Balaam and the leaders who were with him .
The next morning Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth Baal , from where Balaam could see a part of the people of Israel .
He said to Balak : » Build seven altars here for me . Then bring me seven bulls and seven rams . «
Balak did as he was told . He and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar .
Then Balaam said to Balak : » Stand here by your burnt offering . I will go to see whether or not Jehovah will meet me . I will tell you what he reveals to me . « So he went alone to the top of a hill .
God met him and Balaam said to God : » I have built the seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each . «
Jehovah told Balaam : » Go back to Balak and give him my message . «
He went back to Balak and found him standing beside his burnt offering with all the princes of Moab .
Balaam delivered this message : » Balak brought me from Aram . The king of Moab summoned me from the eastern mountains . Come and curse Jacob for me , « he said . ‘ Come and condemn Israel .
» ‘ How can I curse those whom God has not cursed ? How can I condemn those whom Jehovah has not condemned ?
» ‘ I see them from the top of rocky cliffs . I look at them from the hills . I see a nation that lives by itself ! These are people who do not consider themselves to be like other nations .
» ‘ The descendants of Jacob are like specks of dust . Who can count them or number even one-fourth of the people of Israel ? Let me die the death of innocent people . Let my end be like theirs . ’ «
Balak responded to Balaam : » What have you done to me ? I brought you here to curse my enemies , but all you have done is bless them ! «
Balaam answered : » I must say what Jehovah tells me to say . «
Balak said : » Please come with me to another place , where you can see the Israelites . You will see only some of them , not all of them . Curse them for me from there . «
So he took him to the Field of Zophim on top of Mount Pisgah . He built seven altars there . He offered a bull and a ram on each altar .
Then Balaam said to Balak : » Stay here beside your burnt offering while I meet with God over there . «
Jehovah met Balaam and told him what to say . He sent him back to Balak to give him his message .
So he returned and found Balak still standing by his burnt offering . He was with the leaders of Moab . Balak asked what Jehovah said .
Balaam uttered this prophecy : » Come , Balak son of Zippor , and listen to what I have to say .
» God is a not man that he should lie . He is not a son of man who changes his mind . Does he ever promise and not fulfill ? Does he ever speak and not act ?
» I have been instructed to bless . And when God blesses , I cannot call it back .
» He has not observed wickedness in Jacob . Nor has he seen trouble in Israel ! Jehovah his God is with him and the shout of a king is among them .
» God brings them out of Egypt . He is for them like the horns of the wild bull .
» For there is omen spell against Jacob , Nor is there any divination against Israel . At the proper time it will be said to Jacob and Israel : What God has done !
» Behold , the nation of Israel ! It is like a mighty lion : It will rise and not lie down again until it has torn and devoured it’s pray . It will drink the blood of those it has killed . «
Balak said to Balaam : » You refuse to curse malign the people of Israel , but at least do not bless them ! «
Balaam answered : » Did I not tell you that I must do everything Jehovah tells me ? «
Balak replied : » Come with me . I will take you to another place . Perhaps God will be willing to let you curse them for me from there . «
So he took Balaam to the top of Mount Peor overlooking the desert .
Balaam said to him : » Build seven altars for me here and bring me seven bulls and seven rams . «
Balak did as he was told . He offered a bull and a ram on each altar .
Balaam knew that Jehovah wanted him to bless the people of Israel . So he did not go to look for omens , as he had done before . He turned toward the desert .
There he saw the people of Israel camped tribe by tribe . The Spirit of God took control of him .
He uttered this prophecy : The message of Balaam son of Beor . These are the words of the man who can see clearly .
The oracle of him who hears the words of God and who sees the vision of the Almighty . Falling down , yet having his eyes open .
How good are your tents , O Jacob , Your dwellings , O Israel !
» They are like valleys that stretch out , like gardens beside the river , like aloes planted by Jehovah , like cedars beside the waters .
» Water will flow from his buckets and his seed will be by many waters . His king shall be higher than Agag . And his kingdom shall be exalted .
» God brings him out of Egypt . He is for him like the horns of the wild bull . He will devour the nations who are his adversaries . He will crush their bones in pieces and shatter them with his arrows .
» He bows down and he lies down like a lion . Like a lion , who dares rouse him ? Blessed is everyone who blesses you ! Cursed is everyone who curses you ! «
Balak’s anger burned against Balaam . He struck his hands together and Balak said to Balaam : I called you to curse my enemies ! But you have persisted in blessing them three times !
Therefore , run away to your place now . I said : » I will honor you greatly , but Jehovah has held you back from honor . «
Balaam replied to Balak : » Did I not tell the messengers whom you sent to me :
» Even if Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold , I could not do anything contrary to the command of Jehovah either good or bad , of my own accord . What Jehovah speaks , that I will speak !
» Now I am going to my people . Come along and I will advise you what this people will do to your people in the days to come . «
He began his discourse by saying : » The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor . The oracle of the man , whose eye is opened ,
» The oracle of him who hears the words of God , knows the knowledge of the Most High , and sees the vision of the Almighty . Falling down , yet having his eyes uncovered .
» I see him , but not now ! I behold him , but not near ! A star shall come forth from Jacob . A scepter shall rise from Israel and shall crush through the forehead of Moab . It will tear down all the sons of Sheth .
» Edom shall be a possession . Seir , its enemies , also will be a possession . This while Israel performs valiantly .
» One from Jacob will have dominion and will destroy the remnant from the city . «
He looked at Amalek and continued his discourse . He said : Amalek was the first of the nations but he will end in destruction .
And he looked at the Kenite and continued his discourse . He said : » Your dwelling place is enduring and your nest is set in the cliff .
» Nevertheless Kain will be consumed ! How long will Asshur keep you captive ? «
He again offered his discourse and said : » Alas , who can live except God ordain it ?
» Ships will come from the coast of Kittim . They will afflict Asshur and will afflict Eber . They will also come to destruction . «
Balaam got up and went back home . Balak also went his way .
While Israel remained at Shittim , the people indulged in sexual immorality with the Moabite women .
The Moabites invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods . The people ate and bowed down to their gods .
So Israel joined itself to Baal of Peor . Jehovah was angry against Israel .
Jehovah said to Moses : » Take all the leaders of the people and execute them in broad daylight before Jehovah so that the fierce anger of Jehovah may turn away from Israel . «
Moses said to the judges of Israel : » Each of you put to death those men who have joined in worshiping Baal of Peor . «
One of the Israelite men brought a Midianite woman to his brothers . He did this right in front of Moses and the entire congregation of Israel while they were crying at the entrance to the tent of meeting .
Phinehas , son of Eleazar and grandson of the priest Aaron , saw this . He left the assembly and grabbed a spear in his hand .
He went into the tent after the Israelite man . He drove the spear through the man and into the woman’s body . Because of this , the plague that the Israelites were experiencing stopped .
Twenty-four thousand people died from that plague .
Jehovah continued speaking to Moses :
Jehovah said to Moses : » Phinehas , son of Eleazar and grandson of the priest Aaron , turned my fury away from the Israelites . Since he stood up for me , I did not have to stand up for myself and destroy them .
» Tell Phinehas that I now make a promise of peace to him .
» My promise is that he and his descendants will be priests for a very long time because he stood up for his God . He made peace with Jehovah for the Israelites . «
The name of the Israelite man who was killed with the Midianite woman was Zimri , son of Salu . Salu was the leader of a family from Simeon .
The name of the Midianite woman who was killed was Cozbi , daughter of Zur . Zur was the head of a family from the Midianite tribes .
Jehovah said to Moses :
» Treat the Midianites as your enemies , and kill them !
» This is because they treated you as enemies . They plotted to trick you in the incident that took place at Peor . They used their sister Cozbi , daughter of a Midianite leader , who was killed on the day of the plague caused by the incident at Peor . «
After the plague Jehovah said to Moses and Eleazar son of the priest Aaron :
» Take a census of the entire congregation of Israel by households . List those who are at least twenty years old and eligible for military duty . «
Moses and the priest Eleazar spoke to the Israelites on the plains of Moab near the Jordan River across from Jericho . They said :
» Take a census of those at least twenty years old , as Jehovah commanded Moses . « These are the Israelites who came from Egypt :

Jehovah said to Moses :
» Use the list of names from the census to divide the land these people will possess .
» Give more land to larger tribes and less land to smaller ones . Use the totals from the census in giving land to each tribe .
» The land must also be divided by drawing lots . The tribes will receive their land based on the names of their ancestors .
» Whether the tribes are large or small , the land must be divided by drawing lots . «
The families descended from Levi were listed as the family of Gershon , the family of Kohath , and the family of Merari .
These were the families of Levi : the Libnite family , the Hebronite family , the Mahlite family , the Mushite family , and the Korahite family . Kohath was the ancestor of Amram .
The name of Amram’s wife was Jochebed , a descendant of Levi , who was born in Egypt . She gave birth to Amram’s children : Aaron , Moses , and their sister Miriam .
Aaron was the father of Nadab , Abihu , Eleazar , and Ithamar .
Nadab and Abihu died because they offered unauthorized fire in Jehovah’s presence .
The total number of all the Levite males at least one month old was twenty-three thousand . They were not counted along with the other Israelites , because they were given no land of their own .
Moses and the priest Eleazar added up the total number of Israelites on the plains of Moab near the Jordan River across from Jericho .
Not a single one of the Israelites Moses and the priest Aaron had counted in the Desert of Sinai were there .
Jehovah said : » They must all die in the desert wilderness . « The only ones left were Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun .
Zelophehad , son of Hepher , grandson of Gilead , descendant of Machir , whose father was Manasseh , belonged to the families of Manasseh , son of Joseph . Their names were Mahlah , Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .
They came to Moses and stood in front of him , the priest Eleazar , the leaders , and the entire congregation at the entrance to the tent of meeting . They said :
» Our father died in the desert . He was not a part of Korah’s followers who joined forces against Jehovah . He died for his own sin and left no sons .
» Why should our father’s name be allowed to die out in his family because he had no son ? Give us property among our father’s relatives . «
So Moses brought their case to Jehovah .
Jehovah said to him :
» Zelophehad’s daughters are right . You must give them property of their own among their father’s relatives . Turn their father’s property over to them .
» Tell the Israelites : ‘ If a man dies and leaves no sons , turn his property over to his daughters .
» ‘ If he has no daughters give his property to his brothers .
» ‘ If he has no brothers give his property to his uncles on his father’s side of the family .
» ‘ If he has no uncles , give his property to the nearest relative in his family . That relative will take possession of it . This will be a rule for the Israelites , as Jehovah commanded Moses . ’ «
Jehovah said to Moses : » Go up into the Abarim Mountains , and take a look at the land I will give the Israelites .
» After you see it , you , too , will join your ancestors in death , as your brother Aaron did .
» You both rebelled against my command in the Desert of Zin . You did not show the people how holy I am when they were complaining at the oasis . » This was the oasis of Meribah at Kadesh in the Desert of Zin .
Moses prayed :
» O Jehovah our God , source of all life , appoint , I pray , a man who can lead the people
and can command them in battle . Do not allow your congregation to be like sheep without a shepherd . «
Jehovah said to Moses : » Take Joshua son of Nun , a capable man , and place your hands on his head .
» Have him stand in front of Eleazar the priest and the entire congregation , and there before them all proclaim him as your successor .
» Give him some of your authority , so that the whole congregation of Israel will obey him .
» He will depend on Eleazar the priest , who will learn my will by using the Urim and Thummim . In this way Eleazar will direct Joshua and the whole congregation of Israel in all their affairs . «
Moses did as Jehovah commanded him . He had Joshua stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole congregation .
Moses put his hands on Joshua’s head and proclaimed him as his successor , just as Jehovah proclaimed .
Jehovah commanded Moses :
» Instruct the Israelites to present to God at the appointed time the required food offerings that are pleasing to him .
» ‘ These are the food offerings that are to be presented to Jehovah : for the daily burnt offering , two one-year-old male lambs without any defects .
» ‘ Offer the first lamb in the morning , and the second in the evening ,
each with a grain offering of two pounds of flour , mixed with two pints of the best olive oil .
» ‘ This is the daily offering that is completely burned . It was first offered at Mount Sinai as a food offering , an odor pleasing to Jehovah .
» ‘ As the wine offering with the first lamb , pour out at the altar two pints of wine .
» ‘ Offer the second lamb in the evening in the same way as the morning offering , together with its wine offering . It also is a food offering , an odor pleasing to Jehovah .
» ‘ On the Sabbath day offer two one-year-old male lambs without any defects , four pounds of flour mixed with olive oil as a grain offering , and the wine offering .

» ‘ With each bull there will be a grain offering of twenty-four cups of flour mixed with olive oil , with each ram a grain offering of sixteen cups of flour mixed with olive oil .
» ‘ With each one-year-old lamb a grain offering of eight cups of flour mixed with olive oil . This is a burnt offering , a soothing aroma , an offering by fire to Jehovah .
» ‘ The wine offering that goes with each bull will be two quarts of wine , with each ram one and one half quarts of wine , and with each lamb one quart of wine . This will be the monthly burnt offering for every month of the year .

» ‘ In addition to them bring grain offerings of flour mixed with olive oil . Bring twenty-four cups for each bull , sixteen cups for each ram ,
and eight cups for each of the seven lambs .

» ‘ Bring all these offerings on each of the seven days . They are food . They are offerings by fire , a soothing aroma to Jehovah . They will be offered in addition to the daily burnt offering and the wine offering that goes with it .
» ‘ On the seventh day you must have a holy assembly . You must not do any regular work .
» ‘ During the Festival of Weeks , you must have a holy assembly . On that day you must not do any regular work . Bring Jehovah your new grain offering , the first produce harvested from your fields .
» ‘ Offer a burnt offering as an odor pleasing to Jehovah : two young bulls , one ram , and seven one-year-old male lambs , all without any defects .
» ‘ Offer the proper grain offering of flour mixed with olive oil : six pounds with each bull , four pounds with the ram ,
and two pounds with each lamb .
» ‘ Offer one male goat as a sin offering . In this way perform the ritual of purification for the people .
» ‘ Offer these and the wine offering in addition to the daily burnt offering and grain offering .
» ‘ Gather for worship on the first day of the seventh month . Do not work . Trumpets will be blown on that day .
» ‘ Present a burnt offering to Jehovah . It is an odor pleasing to him : one young bull , one ram , and seven one-year-old male lambs , all without any defects .
» ‘ Offer the proper grain offering of flour mixed with olive oil : six pounds of flour with the bull , four pounds with the ram ,

Moses told the Israelites everything Jehovah had commanded him .
Moses said to the heads of the tribes of Israel : This is what Jehovah has commanded about vows :
» If a man makes a vow to Jehovah that he will do something or swears an oath that he will not do something , he must not break his word . He must do everything he said he would do .
» A young girl , who still lives in her father’s house , might make a vow to Jehovah that she will do something or swear an oath that she will not do something .
» She must do everything that she vowed or promised unless her father raises an objection when he hears about it .
» If her father forbids her to fulfill the vow when he hears about it , she is not required to keep it . Jehovah will forgive her , because her father refused to let her keep it .
» If an unmarried woman makes a vow , whether deliberately or carelessly , or promises to abstain from something , and then marries ,
she must do everything that she vowed or promised unless her husband raises an objection when he hears about it .
» If her husband forbids her to fulfill the vow when he hears about it , she is not required to keep it . Jehovah will forgive her .
» A widow or a divorced woman must keep every vow she makes and every promise to abstain from something .
» If a married woman makes a vow or promises to abstain from something ,
her husband may hear about it but may say nothing and not object . Then her vow or oath must be kept .
» But if her husband cancels it when he hears about it , nothing she said in her vow or oath has to be kept . Her husband has canceled it . Jehovah will free her from this vow or oath .
» A husband decides whether or not his wife has to keep any vow to do something or any oath to do without something .
» If he says nothing to her about it day after day , this means he decided that she must keep her vow or oath . She must keep it because he said nothing to her when he heard about it .
» If he cancels it later , he will suffer the consequences . «
These are the laws Jehovah gave Moses for husbands and wives , and for fathers with young daughters still living at home .
Jehovah said to Moses :
» Get even with the Midianites for what they did to the Israelites . After that you will join your ancestors in death . «
Moses said to the people : » Your men must get ready to go to war against the Midianites . Jehovah will use them to get even with Midian .
» Send one thousand men from each of the tribes of Israel . «
Thus one thousand men from each tribe were supplied from the divisions of Israel , twelve thousand men ready for war .
Moses sent them off to war . There were one thousand men from each tribe along with Phinehas , son of the priest Eleazar . Phinehas took with him the holy articles and the trumpets for the fanfare .
They went to war against Midian , as Jehovah commanded Moses , and killed every man .
Included in those killed were the five kings of Midian-Evi , Rekem , Zur , Hur , and Reba . They also killed Balaam , son of Beor , in battle .
The Israelites took the Midianite women and children as prisoners of war . They also took all their animals , their livestock , and their valuables as loot .
They burned the cities where the Midianites lived and all their settlements .
They took everything as loot including all the people and animals ,
and brought the prisoners of war , the loot , and everything to Moses , the priest Eleazar , and the congregation of Israel at the camp on the plains of Moab near the Jordan River across from Jericho .
Moses , the priest Eleazar , and all the leaders of the congregation went outside the camp to meet them .
Moses was angry with the officers of the army , the commanders of the companies and battalions , who were returning from battle .
Moses asked them : » Have you spared all the women ?
» Look , these women caused the Israelites , through the counsel of Balaam , to trespass against Jehovah in the matter of Peor . Thus the congregation of Jehovah experienced the plague .
» So kill all the Midianite boys and every Midianite woman who has gone to bed with a man .
» But keep alive for yourselves every girl who has never gone to bed with a man .
» Everyone who killed a person or touched a dead body must stay outside the camp seven days . You and your prisoners of war must use the ritual water on the third and seventh days in order to take away your sin .
» You must do the same for all the clothes and everything made of leather , goats’ hair , or wood . «
Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone into battle : » This is what Jehovah’s Law told Moses to do :
» Only the gold and the silver , the copper , the iron , the tin and the lead ,
everything that can stand the fire , you shall pass through the fire , and it will be clean . It must be purified with water for impurity . Anything that cannot stand the fire you shall pass through the water .
» You must wash your clothes on the seventh day and be clean . After that you may enter the camp . «
Jehovah spoke to Moses :
» You and Eleazar the priest and the heads of the families of the congregation take a count of the booty that was captured , both of man and of animal .
» Divide the booty between the warriors who went out to battle and the entire congregation .
» Levy a tax for Jehovah from the men of war who went out to battle , one in five hundred of the persons and of the cattle and of the donkeys and of the sheep .
» Take it from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest , as an offering to Jehovah .
» From the sons of Israel’s half , you shall take one drawn out of every fifty of the persons , of the cattle , of the donkeys and of the sheep , from all the animals , and give them to the Levites who keep charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah . «
Moses and Eleazar the priest did just as Jehovah commanded Moses .
The booty that remained from the spoil the men of war had plundered was six hundred and seventy-five thousand sheep ,
and seventy-two thousand cattle ,
and sixty-one thousand donkeys ,
and of human beings , of the women who had not known man intimately , all the persons were thirty-two thousand .
The half , the portion of those who went out to war , was as follows : the number of sheep was three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred .
Jehovah’s levy of the sheep was six hundred and seventy-five .
There were thirty-six thousand cattle , from which Jehovah’s levy was seventy-two .
There were thirty thousand five hundred donkeys , from which Jehovah’s levy was sixty-one .
There were sixteen thousand human beings , from whom Jehovah’s levy was thirty-two persons .
Moses gave the levy that was Jehovah’s offering to Eleazar the priest , just as Jehovah had commanded Moses .
And from the Israelites half , which Moses separated from the men who had gone to war .
The congregation’s half was three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep ,
and thirty-six thousand cattle ,
and thirty thousand five hundred donkeys ,
and the human beings were sixteen thousand .
Moses took one drawn out of every fifty , both of man and of animals from the Israelite’s half . He gave them to the Levites , who kept charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah , just as Jehovah commanded Moses .
Then the officers who were over the thousands of the army , the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds , approached Moses .
They said to Moses : » Your servants have taken a census of men of war who are in our charge , and no man of us is missing .
» So we brought as an offering to Jehovah what each man found , articles of gold , armlets and ankle bracelets , signet rings , earrings and necklaces , to make atonement for ourselves before Jehovah . «
Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them , all kinds of molded articles .
All the gold of the offering they gave to Jehovah , from the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds , was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels .
Each of the men of war had taken booty .
So Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and brought it to the tent of meeting as a memorial for the Israelites before Jehovah .
The sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad had a large number of livestock . They saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead was indeed a place suitable for livestock .
They approached Moses , the priest Eleazar , and the leaders of the congregation and said :
» Ataroth , Dibon , Jazer , Nimrah , Heshbon , Elealeh , Sebam , Nebo , and Beon ,
the land Jehovah won for the congregation of Israel , is a good place for livestock . Gentlemen , we have livestock . «
» Please give us this land as our property . Do not make us cross the Jordan River . «
Moses asked the tribes of Gad and Reuben : Are you going to stay here while the rest of the Israelites go to war ?
That might discourage them from entering the land Jehovah has given them .
That is what your ancestors did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to look at the land .
They went as far as the Eshcol Valley . They saw the land . But then they discouraged the rest of the Israelites from entering the land Jehovah had given them .
That day Jehovah became angry and swore this oath :
» None of the people twenty years old or older , who came from Egypt , will see the land I promised Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob with an oath . This is because they did not wholeheartedly follow me .
» Only Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun will get to see the land . This is because they wholeheartedly followed Jehovah .
» Jehovah’s anger blazed against the Israelites . Therefore he made them wander in the desert for forty years until the whole generation of those who had done evil in Jehovah’s presence was gone .
» You are just like your parents ! You are a bunch of sinners trying to make Jehovah angry at Israel again .
» If you turn away from him he will abandon all these people in the desert . You would be responsible for their destruction . «
The tribes of Gad and Reuben came to Moses and said : » Allow us to build stone fences for our livestock and cities for our families here .
» Then we will be ready to march in battle formation ahead of the other Israelites until we have brought them to their land . Meanwhile our families will live in walled cities . They will be safe from the other people who live here .
» We will not return to our homes until every Israelite has received his own land .
» We will not take possession of any land on the other side of the Jordan River , to the west and beyond . We already have our land here , east of the Jordan . «
Moses answered : » If you really mean what you say , then here in the presence of Jehovah get ready to go into battle .
» All your fighting men are to cross the Jordan and under Jehovah’s command they are to attack our enemies until Jehovah defeats them
and takes possession of the land . You may return after that , because you will have fulfilled your obligation to Jehovah and to the other Israelites . Then Jehovah will acknowledge that this land east of the Jordan is yours .
» If you do not keep your promise , I warn you that you will be sinning against Jehovah . Do not doubt this , you will be punished for your sin .
» So build your towns and the enclosures for your sheep , but do what you have promised ! «
The men from Reuben and Gad answered Moses : » Sir , we will do just what you have said .
» Our wives , children , sheep and cattle will stay here in the towns in Gilead .
» However those of us prepared for battle will cross the Jordan and fight for Jehovah . «
Moses said to Eleazar , Joshua , and the family leaders :
» Make sure the tribes of Gad and Reuben prepare for battle and cross the Jordan River with you . If they do , then after the land is in your control , give them the region of Gilead as their tribal land .
» But if they break their promise , they will receive land on the other side of the Jordan , like the rest of the tribes . «
The tribes of Gad and Reuben replied : » We are your servants and will do whatever Jehovah has commanded .
» We will enter Canaan as armed troops in Jehovah’s presence . The land we will take possession of is here , east of the Jordan . «
So Moses gave the tribes of Gad , Reuben , and half of the tribe of Manasseh , son of Joseph , the kingdoms of King Sihon of the Amorites and King Og of Bashan . It was the whole land with its cities and its surrounding territory .
The tribe of Gad rebuilt the cities of Dibon , Ataroth , Aroer ,
Atroth Shophan , Jazer , Jogbehah ,
Beth Nimrah , and Beth Haran as walled cities . They also built stone fences for their flocks .
The tribe of Reuben rebuilt the cities of Heshbon , Elealeh , Kiriathaim ,
Nebo , Baal Meon whose names were changed , and Sibmah . These are the names they gave the cities they rebuilt .
The descendants of Machir son of Manasseh went to Gilead . They captured it and forced out the Amorites who were there .
So Moses gave Gilead to the people of Machir the descendants of Manasseh , and they lived there .
Then Jair , a descendant of Manasseh , captured the settlements in Gilead . He called them Havvoth Jair .
Nobah captured Kenath and its villages . He named it Nobah after himself .
This is a list of all the places where the Israelites set up camp after they left Egypt in organized groups under the leadership of Moses and Aaron .
Jehovah command Moses to wrote down the places where they went as they traveled . This is the list :

They moved from Ezion Geber and set up camp at Kadesh in the Desert of Zin .
They moved from Kadesh and set up camp at Mount Hor on the border of Edom .
Jehovah commanded Aaron the priest to go up on Mount Hor . He died there on the first day of the fifth month in the fortieth year after the Israelites left Egypt .
Aaron was one hundred and twenty-three years old when he died on Mount Hor .
The Canaanite king of Arad , who lived in the Negev in Canaan , heard that the Israelites were coming .
They moved from Mount Hor and set up camp at Zalmonah .
They moved from Zalmonah and set up camp at Punon .
The Israelites moved from Punon and set up camp at Oboth .
Then they moved from Oboth and set up camp at Iye Abarim on the border of Moab .
They moved from Iyim and set up camp at Dibongad .
Thaey moved fromDibongad and set up camp at Almon Diblathaim .
They moved from Almon Diblathaim and set up camp in the Abarim Mountains east of Nebo .
They moved from the Abarim Mountains and set up camp on the plains of Moab near the Jordan River across from Jericho .
They set up camp on the plains of Moab along the Jordan . Their camp extended from Beth Jeshimoth to Abel Shittim .
Jehovah said to Moses on the plains of Moab near the Jordan River across from Jericho ,
Tell the Israelites : » You will cross the Jordan River and enter Canaan .
» As you advance , force out all the people who live there . Get rid of all their stone and metal idols , and destroy all their places of worship .
» Take possession of the land and live there . I will give it to you for your own .
Divide the land among your families by drawing lots . Give more land to larger families and less land to smaller ones . The land must be given to each family by drawing lots . Divide it among your ancestors’ tribes .
» If you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land , those that are left will be as troublesome as splinters in your eyes and thorns in your sides . They will fight against you .
» If you do not drive them out , I will destroy you , as I planned to destroy them . «
Jehovah gave Moses
the following instructions for the people of Israel : » When you enter Canaan , the land I am giving you , these are the borders of your territory .
» The southern border will extend from the wilderness of Zin along the border of Edom . It will begin on the east at the southern end of the Dead Sea .
» It will turn southward toward Akrabbim Pass and continue on through Zin as far south as Kadesh Barnea . It will turn northwest to Hazar Addar and on to Azmon ,
where it will turn toward the valley at the border of Egypt and end at the Mediterranean .
» The western border will be the Mediterranean Sea , it will be the western border .
» The northern border will follow a line from the Mediterranean to Mount Hor
and from there to Hamath Pass . It will continue to Zedad
and to Ziphron , and will end at Hazar Enan .
» The eastern border will follow a line from Hazar Enan to Shepham .
» It will then go south to Harbel , east of Ain , and on to the hills on the eastern shore of Lake Galilee ,
then south along the Jordan River to the Dead Sea . These will be the four borders of your land . «
Moses said to the Israelites : » This is the land you will receive by drawing lots . This is the land that Jehovah has assigned to the nine and one-half tribes .
» The tribes of Reuben and Gad and the eastern half of Manasseh have received their property , divided according to their families ,
on the eastern side of the Jordan , opposite Jericho . «
Jehovah said to Moses :
» These are the names of the men who will divide the land for you : the priest Eleazar and Joshua son of Nun .
» You must also take one leader from each tribe to divide the land .
These are their names : Caleb son of Jephunneh , from the tribe of Judah ,
» Shemuel son of Ammihud , from the tribe of Simeon ;
» Elidad son of Kislon , from the tribe of Benjamin ;
» Bukki son of Jogli , the leader of the tribe of Dan ;
» Hanniel son of Ephod , the leader of the tribe of Manasseh ;
» Kemuel son of Shiphtan , the leader of the tribe of Ephraim ; Manasseh and Ephraim are Joseph’s descendants .
» Elizaphan son of Parnach , the leader of the tribe of Zebulun ;
» Paltiel son of Azzan , the leader of the tribe of Issachar ;
» Ahihud son of Shelomi , the leader of the tribe of Asher ;
» Pedahel son of Ammihud , the leader of the tribe of Naphtali . «
Jehovah commanded these men to divide Canaan for the Israelites .
Jehovah spoke to Moses on the plains of Moab near the Jordan River across from Jericho . He said :
» Tell the Israelites to give the Levites some cities from their own property . They must also give the Levites the pastureland around those cities .
» The Levites will have cities to live in and pastureland for their cattle , the flocks they own , and any other animals they have .
» The land around the cities that you give the Levites will extend fifteen hundred feet from the city wall .
» Outside the city measure off three thousand feet on the east side , three thousand feet on the south side , three thousand feet on the west side , and three thousand feet on the north side , with the city in the center . This will be their pastureland around the city .
» Six of the cities you give the Levites will be cities of refuge . You must allow murderers to escape to these cities . In addition , you must also give the Levites forty-two other cities .
» You will give a total of forty-eight cities with pastureland to the Levites .
» The cities you give the Levites from the property of the other Israelites must be given based on the amount of land each tribe owns . Take more cities from larger tribes and fewer from smaller tribes . «
Jehovah continued to speak to Moses :
» Tell the Israelites : When you cross the Jordan River and enter Canaan ,
select certain cities to be places of refuge . Anyone who unintentionally kills another person may run to them .
» These cities will be places of refuge from any relative who can avenge the death . So anyone accused of murder will not have to die until he has had a trial in front of the community .
» There will be six cities you select as places of refuge .
» Three will be on the east side of the Jordan River and three in Canaan .
» These six cities will be places of refuge for Israelites , foreigners , and strangers among you . Anyone who unintentionally kills another person may flee to these cities .
» If any of you uses an iron weapon to kill another person , you are a murderer . Murderers must be put to death .
» If any of you picks up a stone as a weapon and uses it to kill another person , you are a murderer . Murderers must be put to death .
» And if any of you picks up a piece of wood as a weapon and uses it to kill another person , you are a murderer . Murderers must be put to death .
» The relative who can avenge the death must make sure a murderer is put to death . When he catches up with the murderer , he must kill him .
» If any of you kills someone you hate by shoving him or by deliberately throwing something at him ,
or if you beat your enemy to death with your bare hands , you must be put to death . You are a murderer . The relative who can avenge the death must kill you when he catches up with you , because you are a murderer .
» Should you accidentally kill someone who was not your enemy . Maybe you shoved him or threw something at him but did not mean to kill him .
» Or if you drop a big stone , and someone is killed . However , you did not know the person was there , he was not your enemy , and you were not trying to harm him .
» Then the community must use these rules in order to decide if you are innocent or if the dead person’s relative can avenge the death .
» If you are innocent , the community must protect you from that relative . They must take you back to the city of refuge you fled to . You must live there until the death of the chief priest who was anointed with the holy oil .
» But do not go outside the city of refuge you fled to .
» If the relative who can avenge the death finds you outside the city of refuge and kills you , the relative is not guilty of murder .
» Accused murderers must stay in their city of refuge until the death of the chief priest . They may go back to their own property only after his death .
» These rules apply to you and your descendants wherever you may live .
» Those accused of murder may be found guilty and put to death only on the evidence of two or more witnesses . The evidence of one witness is not sufficient to support an accusation of murder .
» Murderers must be put to death . They cannot escape this penalty by the payment of money .
» If they have fled to a city of refuge , do not allow them to make a payment in order to return home before the death of the High Priest .
» If you did this , you would defile the land where you are living . Murder defiles the land , and except by the death of the murderer there is no way to perform the ritual of purification for the land where someone has been murdered .
» Do not defile the land where you are living ! I am Jehovah and I live among the people of Israel . «
The heads of the families in the clan of Gilead the son of Machir and grandson of Manasseh son of Joseph , went to Moses and the other leaders .
They said : » Jehovah commanded you to distribute the land to the people of Israel by drawing lots . He also commanded you to give the property of our relative Zelophehad to his daughters .
» Remember , if they marry men of another tribe , their property will then belong to that tribe , and the total allotted to us will be reduced .
» During the Year of Restoration , when all property that has been sold is restored to its original owners , the property of Zelophehad’s daughters will be permanently added to the tribe into which they marry and will be lost to our tribe . «
So Moses gave the people of Israel the following command from Jehovah . He said : » What the tribe of Manasseh says is right ,
and so Jehovah says that the daughters of Zelophehad are free to marry anyone they wish but only within their own tribe .
» The property of every Israelite will remain attached to his tribe .
» Every woman who inherits property in an Israelite tribe must marry a man belonging to that tribe . In this way all Israelites will inherit the property of their ancestors ,
and the property will not pass from one tribe to another . Each tribe will continue to possess its own property . «
Zelophehad’s daughters did as Jehovah commanded Moses .
Mahlah , Tirzah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Noah married their cousins on their father’s side of the family .
They married within the families of the descendants of Manasseh , son of Joseph . So their land stayed in the tribe of their father’s family .
These are the commandments and rules Jehovah gave the Israelites through Moses on the plains of Moab near the Jordan River across from Jericho .
These are the words Moses spoke to all Israel . He was on this side of the Jordan in the desert wilderness , in the plain near the Red Sea Suph , between Paran , Tophel , Laban , Hazeroth , and Dizahab .
It is only an eleven-day journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea .
It was the fortieth year , eleventh month , on the first day of the month . Moses spoke to the children of Israel , according to all the commandments Jehovah gave him for them .
After he killed Sihon king of the Amorites , who lived in Heshbon , and Og king of Bashan , who lived at Astaroth in Edrei :
On this side east of Jordan in the land of Moab , Moses declared the Law . He said :
» Jehovah our God spoke to us in Horeb . He said : ‘ You have lived long enough on this mountain .
» Leave this place and go to the mountain of the Amorites , and all the places near there in the plain , in the hills , and in the valley and in the south , and by the sea side , to the land of the Canaanites , and to Lebanon , to the great river , the river Euphrates .
» I have given you this land . Go in and possess the land Jehovah pledged to give to your fathers , Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob and to their descendants offspring after them . ’
» I spoke to you then and said : ‘ I am not able to bear the burden of you alone .
» ‘ Jehovah your God has increased your numbers . Today you are more numerous than the stars of heaven .
» ‘ Jehovah the God of your fathers will make you a thousand times as many as you are , and bless you , as he promised you !
» ‘ How can I alone bear your encumbrance , your burden , and your strife ?
» ‘ Take wise men with understanding , who are known among your tribes . I will make them rulers over you . ’
» You answered me : ‘ The thing you speak is good for us to do . ’
» So I took the chief of your tribes , wise men and known , and made them rulers over you . I made them captains over thousands , and captains over hundreds , and captains over fifties , and captains over tens , and officers among your tribes .
» I charged your judges to hear the cases between your countrymen and judge righteously between every man and his brother , and the stranger with him .
» You will not show partiality in judgment . You shall hear the small and the great . You will not fear man for the judgment is God's . The case that is too hard for you , bring to me , and I will hear it . ’
I commanded you at that time all the things you should do .
» When we left Horeb , we went through that entire great and terrible wilderness . You saw it by way of the mountain of the Amorites , as Jehovah our God commanded us . We went to Kadesh-barnea .
» I said to you : ‘ You have arrived at the mountain of the Amorites . Jehovah gives this mountain to us .
» See , Jehovah your God give you this land . Possess it , for Jehovah the God of your fathers said to you : Do not fear . Do not be discouraged . ’
» Every one of you came near to me and said : ‘ We will send men before us . They will search the land . They will bring us word about the way we must go and what cities are there . ’
What you said pleased me very much . I took twelve of your men , one from each tribe .
They went up to the mountain to the valley of Eshcol , and explored it .
They picked the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down to us . They brought us word again . They said : ‘ It is a good land that Jehovah our God gives us . ’
Even so they were not willing to go . They rebelled against the command of Jehovah your God :
» You complained in your tents , and said : Jehovah hates us so he brought us out of the land of Egypt , to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites , to destroy us .
» ‘ Where can we go up ? Our brothers caused us to lose heart . They said : The people are stronger and taller than we are . The cities are large and the walls go up to the sky . Moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there . « ’
» I said to you : ‘ Do not be afraid of them .
» ‘ Jehovah your God leads you . He will fight for you just as he did for you in Egypt before your eyes !
» ‘ You saw how Jehovah your God carried you like a father carries his son all the way until you reached this place . ’
» Yet in all this you did not trust Jehovah your God .
» He went ahead of you to find places for you to camp . He offered fire by night and cloud by day to show you the way you should go .
» Jehovah heard what you said . He was angry and solemnly swore :
» ‘ Not one man of this evil generation will see that good land , which I swore to give your fathers ,
» ‘ Except Caleb son of Jephunneh . He will see it . I will give him and his descendants the land he walks on . This is because he followed Jehovah wholeheartedly .
» ‘ Jehovah was angry with me because of you . He said to me : ‘ You will also not go there .
» ‘ Your assistant Joshua son of Nun will go there . He will lead the people into the land . Encourage him to go there .
» ‘ The little ones that you said would be taken captive will enter the land . Your children who do not know good from bad will go in . I will give it to them and they will possess it .
» ‘ But you must turn around and go back through the desert toward the Red Sea . ’
» You answered : ‘ We have sinned against Jehovah . We will fight just as Jehovah our God commanded us . ’ ’ When every man puts on his armor and weapons of war they will be ready to go to the mountain .
» ‘ But Jehovah said to me : ‘ Tell them , do not go and fight ! I am not with you . Your enemies will defeat you . « ’
I told you , but you would not listen . You disobeyed Jehovah’s command and proudly invaded the mountainous region .
The Amorites who lived there came out and attacked you . They chased you like a swarm of bees . They defeated you ! They drove you back from Seir all the way to Hormah .
You returned and cried to Jehovah . Jehovah , however , did not listen to you . He turned a deaf ear to you !
That is why you stayed in Kadesh as long as you did .
» We went back into the desert . We followed the road that leads to the Red Sea as Jehovah told me . For a long time we traveled around the region of Mount Seir .
» Then Jehovah said to me :
‘ You traveled around this mountain long enough . Now go north .
» ‘ Give these instructions to the people : » You will pass through the territory of your relatives , the descendants of Esau . They live in Seir . They will be afraid of you . Therefore watch yourselves carefully .
» ‘ Do not start a fight with them , because I am not giving you any of their land , not so much as one foot . I gave Esau's descendants the region of Mount Seir as their property .
» ‘ You must pay them in silver for the food you eat and the water you drink .
» ‘ Remember how Jehovah your God blessed you in everything you have done . He took care of you as you wandered through this vast desert . He has been with you these forty years . You had everything you needed . « ’
We moved on and left the road that goes from the towns of Elath and Eziongeber to the Dead Sea . » We turned northeast toward Moab . «
» Then Jehovah said to me : ‘ Do not trouble the people of Moab , the descendants of Lot . And do not start a war with them . I gave them the city of Ar , and I am not going to give you any of their land . ’
The Emits used to live there . They are a mighty race of giants who lived in Ar . They were as tall as the Anakim , another race of giants .
Like the Anakim they were also known as Rephaim ; but the Moabites called them Emim .
Horites used to live in Seir , but the descendants of Esau chased them out . They destroyed their nation and settled there themselves . This is similar to the Israelites who later chased their enemies out of the land that Jehovah gave them .
Then we crossed the Zered River Valley just as Jehovah told us to do .
This was thirty-eight years after we left Kadesh-Barnea . By that time all the men who had been in the army at Kadesh-Barnea had died , just as Jehovah said they would .
Jehovah kept getting rid of them until finally none of them were left .
» When the last of these soldiers died ,
» Jehovah said to me Moses :
» ‘ You will cross over the border of Moab at Ar today .
» ‘ When you come near the Ammonites , do not bother them or start a fight with them . I am not giving you any of the land that I already gave to the descendants of Lot as their property .
» ‘ This territory is also known as the land of the Rephaim . That is the name of the giants who formerly lived there . The Ammonites called them Zamzummim .
» They were as tall as the Anakim . There were many of them . They were a mighty race . But Jehovah destroyed them . Then the Ammonites took over their land and settled there .
» Jehovah did the same thing for the Edomites , the descendants of Esau , who live in the mountains of Edom . He destroyed the Horites . That allowed the Edomites to take over their land and settled there , where they still live .
» The Avims lived in Hazerim , even as far as Azzah . The Caphtorims came from Caphtor to destroy them and live there in their place .
Moses continued : » Cross over the Arnon River . I will help you defeat Sihon the Amorite , king of Heshbon and his country . Possess his land and engage him in battle .
» From this day forward I will make all the people and nations through out the earth afraid of you . They will hear reports about you and tremble and be in anguish because of you .
» I sent messengers from the desert of Kedemoth to King Sihon of Heshbon with the following offer of peace :
‘ If you allow us to travel through your country , we will go straight through and will not leave the road .
‘ We will pay you in silver for the food we eat and the water we drink . Please let us go through ,
as the descendants of Esau , who live in Seir , and the Moabites , who live in Ar , did for us . We will keep going until we cross the Jordan River into the land Jehovah our God is giving us . ’
King Sihon of Heshbon would not allow us to pass through . Jehovah your God made him stubborn and overconfident in order to hand him over to you , as he has now done .
» Then Jehovah said to me : ‘ I make King Sihon and his land helpless before you . Capture his land and occupy it . ’
Sihon came out with all his men to fight us near the town of Jahaz ,
and Jehovah our God helped us defeat them . We killed Sihon , his sons , and all his people .
We captured and destroyed every town in Sihon's kingdom . We killed everyone .
We took the livestock and everything else of value .
Jehovah helped us capture every town from the Arnon River Gorge north to the boundary of Gilead . This included the town of Aroer on the edge of the gorge and the town in the middle of the gorge .
However , we did not go near the Ammonite towns , both in the mountains and near the Jabbok River , just as Jehovah commanded .
» Next we headed for the land of Bashan . King Og of Bashan and all his army came to fight us at Edrei .
» Jehovah said to me : ‘ Do not be afraid of him . I will hand him , all his army , and his land , over to you . Do to him what you did to King Sihon of the Amorites , who ruled in Heshbon . ’
» So Jehovah our God also handed King Og of Bashan and all his army over to us . We defeated him and left no survivors .
» We captured all his cities . Not one was missed . We captured a total of sixty cities in the territory of Argob , the kingdom of Og in Bashan .
» All of these cities were fortified with high walls and double-door gates with bars across the gates . We also captured a large number of unwalled villages .
» We destroyed all the towns and put to death all the men , women , and children . This was just as we did in the towns that belonged to King Sihon of Heshbon .
» We kept the livestock and took plunder from the towns .
» Sihon and Og ruled Amorite kingdoms east of the Jordan River . Their land stretched from the Arnon River Gorge in the south to Mount Hermon in the north . We captured it all .
» Mount Hermon is called Mount Sirion by the people of Sidon . The Amorites call it Mount Senir .
» All the cities of the plain , and all Gilead , and all Bashan , and Salecah and Edrei , cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan were captured .
» Of the Rephaim only King Og of Bashan was left . His bed was made of iron and was more than thirteen feet long and six feet wide . It is still in the Ammonite city of Rabbah .
» We took possession of this land . I gave the tribes of Reuben and Gad the land north of Aroer near the Arnon Valley and half of the mountain region of Gilead with its cities .
» I assigned the rest of Gilead and also all of Bashan , where Og had ruled , that is , the entire Argob region to half the tribe of Manasseh . Bashan was known as the land of the Rephaim .
Jair , from the tribe of Manasseh , took the entire region of Argob , that is , Bashan , as far as the border of Geshur and Maacah . He named the villages after himself , and they are still known as the villages of Jair .
I assigned Gilead to the clan of Machir of the tribe of Manasseh .
» I assigned the territory from Gilead to the Arnon River to the tribes of Reuben and Gad . The middle of the river was their southern boundary , and their northern boundary was the Jabbok River , part of which formed the Ammonite border .
» On the west their territory extended to the Jordan River , from Lake Galilee in the north down to the Dead Sea in the south and to the foot of Mount Pisgah on the east .
» Then I gave them the following instructions : ‘ Jehovah our God gave you the land east of the Jordan to occupy . Now arm your fighting men and send them across the Jordan ahead of the other tribes of Israel , to help them occupy their land .
» ‘ Your wives , children , and livestock , for you have a lot of livestock , will remain behind in the towns I assigned to you .
» ‘ Help the other Israelites until they occupy the land Jehovah is giving them west of the Jordan and until Jehovah lets them live there in peace , just as he has done here for you . After that , you may return to the land I assigned to you . ’
» I also gave Joshua this command : ‘ You have seen with your own eyes everything Jehovah your God has done to these two kings . Jehovah will do the same to all of the kingdoms on the other side of the Jordan River where you are going .
» ‘ Do not be afraid of them . For Jehovah your God fights for you . ’
» Then I pleaded with Jehovah :
» ‘ O Sovereign Lord Jehovah , you have begun to show me how great and powerful you are . What kind of god is there in heaven or on earth that can do the deeds and the mighty acts you have done ?
» ‘ Please let me go over and see the beautiful land on the other side of the Jordan River . Let me see those beautiful mountains in Lebanon . ’
» Jehovah was angry with me because of you , so he would not listen to me . He said : ‘ Enough of that ! Do not talk to me anymore about this .
» ‘ Go to the top of Mount Pisgah , and look west , north , south , and east . You may look at the land , but you will never cross the Jordan River .
» ‘ Joshua will lead Israel across the Jordan to take the land . So help him . Encourage him and strengthen him . Tell him what he must do . ’
So we stayed in the valley at Beth Peor .
» Israel , listen to these laws and teachings ! If you obey them you will live ! Go in and take the land that Jehovah the God of your fathers is giving you .
» He is your God . I am telling you everything he has commanded . So do not add anything or take anything away .
» You saw how he killed everyone who worshiped the god Baal at Peor .
» But all of you who were faithful to Jehovah your God are still alive today .
» I have taught you laws and rules as Jehovah my God commanded me . You must obey them when you enter the land and take possession of it .
» Carefully obey the laws . For this will show your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations . They will hear all these statutes and say : ‘ Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people . ’
» What great nation is there , who has God so near to them ? For we call on Jehovah our God for all things !
» And what great nation is there that has statutes and judgments so righteous as the law I present to you this day ?
» Be on your guard ! Make sure you do not forget , as long as you live , what you have seen with your own eyes . Teach them to your children and your grandchildren .
» Do you remember the day you stood in the presence of Jehovah your God at Mount Sinai Horeb ? He said to me : ‘ assemble the people . I want them to hear what I have to say , so that they will learn to obey me as long as they live . Then they will teach their children to do the same . ’
» Tell your children how you went close and stood at the foot of the mountain covered with thick clouds of dark smoke and fire blazing up to the sky .
» Tell them how Jehovah spoke to you from the fire . Tell them that you heard him speak but did not see him in any form at all .
» He told you what you must do to keep the covenant he made with you . You must obey the Ten Commandments , which he wrote on two stone tablets .
» Jehovah told me to teach you all the laws that you are to obey in the land that you are about to invade and occupy .
» Be careful ! When God spoke to you from the fire , he was invisible .
» Do not commit the sin of worshiping idols . Do not make idols to be worshiped , whether they are shaped like men , women ,
animals on the earth , birds that fly in the air ,
or they are like reptiles that creep on the ground , or fish from the water .
» Do not be tempted to bow down and worship the sun or moon or stars the host or army of the heavens . Jehovah put them there a heritage for all the people under the heavens .
» But you are Jehovah’s people ! He led you through fiery trials and rescued you from Egypt .
» Furthermore , Jehovah was angry with me because of you . So Jehovah your God took an oath that I would not cross the Jordan River and enter the good land he is giving you as your property inheritance possession .
» I am going to die in this land . I will not cross the Jordan River . But you are going to go across and take possession of that good land .
» Take care of yourselves . Do not forget the covenant of Jehovah your God , which he made with you . Do not make a graven image , or the likeness of anything , which Jehovah your God has forbidden .
» For Jehovah your God is a consuming fire , even a totally demanding zealous God . He requires exclusive devotion !
» When you have children , and grandchildren , and you have remained in the land a long time do not corrupt yourselves . If you make a graven image , or the likeness of any thing , and do evil in the sight of Jehovah your God , you will provoke him to anger :
» I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day that you will soon utterly perish from off the land you possess the other side of the Jordan . You will not prolong your days upon it , but will be destroyed .
» Jehovah will scatter you among the nations . You will become few in number among the heathen , where Jehovah will lead you .
» You will serve gods that are the work of men's hands . Made of wood and stone . They cannot see , hear , eat or smell .
» From there you will seek Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your being . And you will find him !
» When you are in trouble distress and all these things happen to you in the latter days , turn to Jehovah your God and obey his voice .
» Jehovah your God is a merciful God . He will not forsake you . He will not destroy you , nor forget the covenant he made with your fathers .
» Ask about the days from the past . A time that came before you , since the day that God created man upon the earth . And ask from one side of heaven to the other whether there has ever been anything like this great thing , or anything like it has been heard ?
» Did people ever hear the voice of God speaking out of the middle of the fire , as you have heard , and live ?
» Has God attempted to take a nation from the middle of another nation ? Has he done this by temptations , by signs , and by wonders , and by war , and by great terrors ? Yes , and by the use of his great power ! Jehovah your God did all this for you in Egypt before your very eyes !
» This was shown to you that you might know that JEHOVAH IS GOD ! THERE IS NO ONE BESIDES HIM !
» He made you hear his voice out of heaven . That way he could instruct teach correct discipline you . He showed you his great fire on the earth . You heard his words from the middle of the fire .
» He loved your fathers . Therefore he chose their descendants . In fact he watched over you and he brought you out of Egypt with his mighty power .
» He drove out nations far greater than you so that he could bring you in and give you their land as an inheritance as it is today .
» Know this and consider it in your heart today : JEHOVAH IS GOD in heaven above , and on the earth beneath : THERE IS NO ONE ELSE !
» You must keep the regulations and commandments I commanded you today . Then all will go well with you and with your children after you . You may prolong your days on the earth that Jehovah your God gives you for all time . «
Moses set aside three cities on the east side of the Jordan .
Those who unintentionally killed someone whom they had never hated could flee to one of these cities and save their lives .
The cities were Bezer on the desert plateau for the tribe of Reuben , Ramoth in Gilead for the tribe of Gad , and Golan in Bashan for the tribe of Manasseh .
Moses gave God's Laws and teachings to the people of Israel .
After they came out of Egypt they were in the valley east of the Jordan River he gave them the laws .
They were near the town of Bethpeor . This was in the territory that had belonged to King Sihon of the Amorites , who had ruled in the town of Heshbon . Moses and the people of Israel defeated him when they came out of Egypt .
They occupied his land and the land of King Og of Bashan , the other Amorite king who lived east of the Jordan .
This land extended from the town of Aroer , on the edge of the Arnon River , north to Mount Sirion , that is , Mount Hermon .
It included the region east of the Jordan River as far south as the Dead Sea and east to the foot of Mount Pisgah .
Moses called all the people of Israel , and said : » Hear , O Israel , the regulations and laws I declare to you today . Learn them and obey them !
» Jehovah our God made a covenant with us at Horeb .
» Jehovah did not make this covenant with our fathers , but with us , all of us here alive today .
» Jehovah talked with you face to face on the mountain out of the middle of the fire ,
» I stood between Jehovah and you at that time , to declare to you the word of Jehovah . You were afraid because of the fire . So you would not go up onto the mountain . He said :
» ‘ I am Jehovah your God . I brought you out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage .
» ‘ Do not have any other god but me .
» ‘ Do not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above , or on the earth below , or that is in the waters beneath the earth :
» ‘ Do not bow down to them . Do not serve them ! For I Jehovah your God am a totally demanding zealous God . I require exclusive devotion and punish the fathers and children who hate me to the third and fourth generation .
» ‘ I show loving kindness to thousands of generations who love me and obey my commandments .
» ‘ Do not take the name of Jehovah your God in vain . Jehovah will not leave him unpunished who takes his name in vain .
» ‘ Keep the Sabbath day to sanctify it keep it holy , as Jehovah your God has commanded you .
» ‘ Do all your work in six days .
» ‘ The seventh day is the Sabbath of Jehovah your God : in it you should not do any work . Your son and daughter should not work . Your manservant and maidservant should not work . Your ox , donkey , cattle or any stranger living with you should not work . Your manservant and maidservant should rest as much as you do .
» ‘ Remember that you were servants in the land of Egypt , and that Jehovah your God brought you out through a mighty act . Jehovah your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day .
» ‘ Honor your father and your mother , as Jehovah your God commands you and your days will be prolonged and things will go well with you , in the land Jehovah gives you .
» ‘ Do not kill .
» ‘ Do not commit adultery .
» ‘ Do not steal .
» ‘ Do not bear false witness against another man .
» ‘ Do not desire another man's wife ; do not covet another man's house , his field , or his manservant , or his maidservant , his ox , or his donkey , or any thing that belongs to him . ’
» Jehovah spoke to us when we gathered on the mountain . He spoke with a loud voice from the dark fiery cloud . Jehovah gave us these words , and only these . Then he wrote them on two flat tablets of stone and gave them to me .
» Fire blazed from the mountain , and you heard the voice coming from the darkness . Then your elders came to me .
» They said : ‘ Today Jehovah our God has shown us how powerful and glorious he is . He spoke to us from the fire . We learned that people could live , even though God speaks to them .
» ‘ We do not want to take a chance on being killed by that terrible fire . If we hear Jehovah’s voice again we will die .
» ‘ Has any other human ever heard the only true God speaking from fire , as we have ? And if they have , would they live to tell about it ?
» ‘ They spoke to Moses : ‘ Moses , go and listen to everything that Jehovah our God says . Then tell us whatever Jehovah our God tells you . We will listen and obey . ’
» Jehovah heard the words you spoke to me . He told me : ‘ I have heard what the people said to you . Everything they said was good .
If only they had such a heart in them that they would respect reverence me and obey all my commandments for as long as they live ! Then things would go well for them and their children from generation to generation . ’
Jehovah continued : » Tell the people to go back to their tents . «
But you stay here with me . I will give you all the commands , laws , and rules that you must teach them to obey in the land I will give them to possess .
Be careful to do what Jehovah your God has commanded you . Never turn to the right or to the left .
Follow all the directions Jehovah your God has given you . Then you will continue to live . Life will go well for you ! You will live for a long time in the land that you are going to possess .
» These are the commands , decrees and laws Jehovah your God commanded me to teach you . Obey them after you enter the land and take possession of it .
» As long as you live , you , your son , and your grandson must respect Jehovah your God . All of you must obey his laws and commandments I give you . Then you will live a long time .
» Listen , O Israel , and be careful to obey these laws . Things will go well for you and your population will increase in a land flowing with milk and honey . This is what Jehovah the God of your ancestors promised you .
» Listen , Israel ! JEHOVAH OUR GOD IS ONE GOD !
» You must love Jehovah your God with all your heart and with your entire mind and with all your strength .
» These words that I command you this day must be in your heart .
» Carefully teach them to your sons . Talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way . Speak about them when you lie down , and when you rise up .
» Bind them for a sign upon your hand . They shall be as frontlets between your eyes .
» Write them upon the posts of your house , and on your gates .
» It shall be like the time when Jehovah your God brought you into the land he promised to your fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob . He would give you large and beautiful cities that you did not build .
» The houses will be full of good things that you did not put in them . There will be wells that you did not dig . There will be vineyards and olive orchards that you did not plant . Jehovah will bring you into this land and you will have all you want to eat .
» Beware that you do not forget Jehovah , for he brought you out of Egypt your house of bondage .
» You must respect Jehovah your God . Serve him and swear by his name !
» Do not go after other gods , the gods of the peoples around you .
» Jehovah your God is a totally demanding zealous God . He tolerates no rivals ! The anger of Jehovah your God will burn against you . He will then destroy you from the face of the earth .
» Do not test Jehovah your God like you tested him in Massah .
» Obey the commandments of Jehovah your God . Obey his testimonies and statutes for he commanded you .
» Do what is right and good in Jehovah’s sight . Then you will be able to go in and possess this good land from your enemies , just as he promised your ancestors .
» You will throw out all your enemies as Jehovah said .
» In the future your son will ask you : ‘ What is the meaning of these laws and regulations that Jehovah our God has commanded you ? ’
» ‘ You will answer your son : ‘ We were Pharaoh's slaves in Egypt , and Jehovah brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand .
» ‘ Jehovah showed signs and wonders before our eyes , great and terrible signs , against Egypt , Pharaoh and his entire household .
» ‘ He brought us out from there . That way he could give us the land he swore to give to our fathers .
» ‘ Jehovah commanded us to do all these statutes . He required that we respect Jehovah our God . This was for our own good that he might preserve us alive , as things are today .
» ‘ If we are careful to do these commandments before Jehovah our God , just as he ordered us , it will mean righteousness for us . ’ «
» Jehovah your God will bring you into the land you are to possess . He will clear away many nations ahead of you . The nations he will clear : the Hittites , Girgashites , Amorites , and the Canaanites , the Perizzites , Hivites , and the Jebusites . These seven nations are larger and mightier than you .
» Jehovah your God will deliver them to you . You must crush them ! Completely destroy them . You should make no covenant with them . Do not show them mercy .
» Do not intermarry with them . Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons .
» They will lead your young people away from me to serve other gods . So the anger of Jehovah will be kindled against you and will destroy you suddenly .
» Deal with them in this way : Destroy their altars and break down their sacred pillars . Cut down their idols and burn them with fire .
» You are a holy people to Jehovah your God . Jehovah your God has chosen you to be his own special people out of all the nations of the earth .
» Jehovah set his heart on you . He chose you , even though you did not outnumber all the other people . You were the smallest of all nations .
» You were chosen because Jehovah loved you and kept the oath he swore to your fathers . So he used his mighty hand to bring you out . He freed you from slavery under Pharaoh king of Egypt .
» Keep in mind that Jehovah your God is the only true God . He is the faithful God . He keeps his promise and is merciful to thousands of generations of those who love him and obey his commandments .
» He destroys everyone who hates him . He never takes long to pay back anyone who hates him .
» So obey the commandments , laws , and judgments I give you today .
» If you listen to these rules and faithfully obey them , Jehovah your God will keep his covenant with you and be merciful to you , as he swore to your fathers .
» He will love you , bless you , and increase the number of your descendants . He will bless you with children . He will bless your land with produce : grain , new wine , and olive oil . He will bless your herds with calves , and your flocks with lambs and kids . This will all happen in the land Jehovah will give you , as he swore to your fathers .
» God will bless you more than any other people . There will not be a male or a female barren among you or your livestock .
» Jehovah will take away every sickness from you . He will not afflict you with any of the evil diseases of Egypt , which you have known . He will put them on all who hate you .
» Destroy all the peoples whom Jehovah your God gives you . Do not look at them with pity . Do not serve their gods . For that would be a snare to you .
» You may say in your heart : These nations are stronger then we are , how can we throw them out of their land ?
» Do not be afraid of them . Remember what Jehovah your God did to Pharaoh and all of Egypt .
» You saw with your own eyes the terrible plagues , the miraculous signs , and the amazing things Jehovah did . He used his mighty hand and powerful arm to bring you out . He will do the same thing to all the people who frighten you .
» Jehovah your God will send the hornet against them . Those who are left will hide from you and perish .
» Do not be terrified of them . Jehovah your God is with you . He is great and awesome God .
» Jehovah your God will drive out these nations before you little by little . You will not be able to put an end to them quickly . This is because the wild beasts are too numerous and will multiply around you .
» Jehovah your God will deliver them over to you . He will throw them into great confusion until they are destroyed .
» He will deliver their kings into your hand . You will make their name perish from under heaven . They will not be able to stand before you for you will destroy them .
» Burn the carved images of their gods with fire . Do not covet the silver or the gold that is on them . Do not take it for yourselves , or you will be snared by it . It is an abomination to Jehovah your God .
» Do not bring an abomination into your house . You must utterly detest it and you must utterly abhor it , for it is something banned . «
» Be careful to do all the commandments I commanded you today ! You will then live and multiply and go in and possess the land Jehovah promised to give to your forefathers .
» Remember the forty years Jehovah your God led you in the wilderness . He did this in order to humble you and test you . He wanted to know what was in your heart . Whether you would obey his commandments .
» He humbled you allowed you to suffer with hunger and then fed you with manna . Neither you nor your fathers had seen this before . He did this to teach you that a person cannot live on bread alone but must live on all everything every word that proceeds from the mouth of Jehovah .
» Your clothes did not wear out ! And your feet did not swell these past forty years .
Learn this lesson by heart : Jehovah your God disciplined you like parents discipline their children .
» Obey the commandments of Jehovah your God . Walk in his ways and respect him .
» Jehovah your God will lead you into a good land . It is a land with rivers that do not dry up . Springs and underground streams flow through the valleys and the hills .
» The land has wheat and barley , grapevines , fig trees , and pomegranates . The land has honey and olive trees for olive oil .
» The land will have enough food for you , and you will have everything you need . The land has rocks with iron ore . You will be able to mine copper ore in the mountains .
» When you have eaten all you want , thank Jehovah your God for the good land he has given you .
» Be careful that you do not forget Jehovah your God . Always obey his judgments and Laws that I give you today .
» You will eat all you want . You will build nice houses and live in them .
» Your herds and flocks , silver and gold , and all that you have will increase .
» When this happens , be careful that you do not become arrogant and forget Jehovah your God . He brought you out of slavery in Egypt .
» He was the one who led you through that vast and dangerous wilderness . It was a parched , arid land , with poisonous snakes and scorpions . He was the one who made water come out of solid rock for you .
» He fed you in the desert with manna . Your fathers had never seen this . He did this in order to humble you and test you . But he also did this so that things would go well for you in the end .
» When you succeed do not brag : ‘ I am rich . I earned it all myself . ’ «
» Remember that Jehovah your God gives you the strength to make a living . That is how he keeps the promise he made to your fathers .
» I warn you : ‘ If you forget Jehovah your God and worship other gods , you will perish . ’ «
» Jehovah will destroy you , just as he destroyed the nations you fought . This is because you will not listen to him .
» Hear , O Israel , you are about to cross the Jordan River . You will force out nations that are larger and mightier than you , with big cities that have sky-high walls .
» Their people are tall and strong . They are descendants of Anakim . You know all about them . You also heard it said : Who can oppose the descendants of Anak ?
» Understand today that Jehovah your God is the one who is going ahead of you like a consuming raging devouring fire . He will wipe them out . Then he will use you to crush their power . You will take possession of their land and will quickly destroy them as Jehovah promised you .
» When Jehovah your God expels these people right before your very eyes , do not say to yourselves : ‘ Jehovah brought us here to possess this land because we live right are righteous . ’ ’ This is not the case . It is because these nations are so wicked that Jehovah is forcing them out of your way .
» It is not because you have been living right or because you are so honest that you enter to take possession of their land . It is because these people are so wicked that Jehovah your God is forcing them out of your way . It is also because Jehovah wants to confirm the promise he swore to your fathers Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob .
» Understand this ! It is not because you have been living right that Jehovah your God is giving you this good land to possess . You are a rebellious and impossible stiff-necked stubborn people !
» Never forget how you made Jehovah your God angry in the desert . You rebelled against Jehovah from the day you left Egypt until you came here .
» Even at Mount Horeb you made Jehovah so angry that he wanted to destroy you .
» When I went up on the mountain to get the stone tablets , the tablets of the promise that Jehovah made to you , I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights without food or water .
» Then Jehovah gave me the two stone tablets inscribed by God’s finger Holy Spirit . On them were written all the words Jehovah spoke to you from the fire on the mountain on the day of the assembly .
» At the end of forty days and nights Jehovah gave me the two stone tablets , the tablets of the covenant .
» Jehovah said to me : ‘ Go down from here quickly , for your people whom you brought out of Egypt have acted corruptly . They quickly turned aside from the way that I commanded them . They have made a cast-idol for themselves . ’
» ‘ Jehovah spoke further to me : ‘ I have seen this people . They are a very stubborn people .
» ‘ Leave me alone that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven . I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they . ’
» So I turned and came down from the mountain while the mountain was burning with fire . I carried the two stone tablets of the covenant in my two hands .
» I saw that you had indeed sinned against Jehovah your God . You made yourselves an idol , cast in the shape of a calf . You turned aside quickly from the way Jehovah had commanded you .
» I took hold of the two tablets and threw them from my hands and smashed them before your eyes .
» I fell down before Jehovah . Like the first , forty days and nights I did not eat or drink . This was because of all your sin you committed in doing what was evil in the sight of Jehovah to provoke Him to anger .
» I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure from Jehovah . For he was wrathful against you to the point of destroying you ! But Jehovah listened to me that time also .
» Jehovah was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him ! So I also prayed for Aaron at the same time .
» I took your sinful thing , the calf that you had made , and burned it with fire and crushed it . I ground it very small until it was as fine as dust . I threw its dust into the brook that flowed down the mountain .
» Again at Taberah and at Massah and at Kibroth-hattaavah you provoked Jehovah to anger .
» ‘ Jehovah sent you from Kadesh-barnea . He said : ‘ Go up and possess the land I have given you . ’ ’ Then you rebelled against the command of Jehovah your God . You did not believe him . You did not listen to his voice !
» You have rebelled against Jehovah from the day I knew you .
» So I fell down prostrate before Jehovah the forty days and forty nights . I did this because Jehovah said he would destroy you .
» I prayed to Jehovah and said : ‘ O Jehovah our God , do not destroy your people for they are your inheritance . You have redeemed them through your greatness . You brought them out of Egypt with a mighty hand .
» ‘ » Remember your servants , Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . Do not look at the stubbornness of this people or at their wickedness or their sin .
» ‘ » The land from which you brought us may say : » Jehovah was not able to bring them into the land he promised them and because he hated them he has brought them out to slay them in the desert wilderness . «
» Even now they are your people , your inheritance , whom you brought out by your great power and outstretched arm . «
» Jehovah said to me : ‘ Cut out for yourself two tablets of stone like the former ones . Come up to me on the mountain , and build an ark of wood for yourself .
» ‘ I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets that you shattered . You must place them in the Ark . ’
» I made an Ark out of acacia wood and cut out two tablets of stone like the first ones . Then I took the two tablets in my hands and went up on the mountain .
» He wrote on the tablets , like the former writing . It was the Ten Commandments Ten Words that Jehovah proclaimed to you on the mountain . It was from the middle of the fire on the day of the assembly . Jehovah gave them to me .
» Then I came down from the mountain and put the tablets in the Ark I had made . They are there just as Jehovah commanded me .
The sons of Israel set out from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah . There Aaron died . He was buried there . Eleazar his son ministered as priest in his place .
From there they set out to Gudgodah , and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah , a land with streams of water .
Jehovah then set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the Ark of the covenant of Jehovah . They were to stand before Jehovah to serve and pronounce blessings in his name until this day .
Levi does not have a portion or inheritance with his brothers . Jehovah is his inheritance ; just as Jehovah your God spoke to him .
» I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights like the first time . Jehovah listened to me this time also . Jehovah was not willing to destroy you .
» ‘ Jehovah said to me : ‘ Arise and proceed on your journey ahead of the people . That way they may go in and possess the land that I swore to their fathers to give them . ’
» Now , O Israel , what does Jehovah your God require from you ? You are to respect Jehovah your God . Walk in all his ways and love him ! Serve Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your being .
» Obey Jehovah’s commandments and his statutes I am commanding you today for your good !
» Behold , heaven and the highest heavens belong to Jehovah your God , even the earth and all that is in it .
» Yet Jehovah set his affection on your fathers . He loved them . He chose you their descendants above all peoples , as it is this day .
» Circumcise your heart , and do not stiffen your neck . Circumcise : Cut short the foreskin . Remove hardness of the heart .
» Jehovah your God is the God of gods and the Lord of lords ! He is the great , the powerful , and the awesome God who does not show partiality nor take a bribe .
» He executes justice for the orphan and the widow . He shows His love for the alien by giving him food and clothing .
» Love those who are aliens . For you were also aliens in the land of Egypt .
» Respect Jehovah your God and serve him . Hold fast to him and take your oaths in his name .
» He is your praise ! He is your God ! He performed for you those great and awesome things you saw with your own eyes .
» Your fathers traveled to Egypt , seventy persons in all . Now Jehovah your God has made you as numerous as the stars of the universe physical heavens .
» Love Jehovah your God , and obey all his laws , regulations and commandments .
» Know today that I do not speak with your sons who have not known and who have not seen the discipline of Jehovah your God . They have not seen his greatness and his awesome power .
» They have not seen his signs and the work he did in the middle of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt and to all his land .
» And what He did to Egypt's army , to its horses and its chariots , when He made the water of the Red Sea engulf them while they pursued . Jehovah completely destroyed them !
» They do not know what Jehovah did to you in the wilderness until you came to this place .
» And what he did to Dathan and Abiram , the sons of Eliab , the son of Reuben , when the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them , their households , their tents , and every living thing that followed them in all Israel .
» You have seen with your own eyes all the great deeds Jehovah did .
» Obey every commandment I command you today . Then you may be strong and go in and possess the land you will cross over to possess .
» Then you may prolong your days on the land Jehovah swore to give to your fathers and their descendants . It is a land flowing with milk and honey .
» The land you are entering to possess is not like the land of Egypt from which you came . You used to sow your seed and irrigate it with your foot as in a vegetable garden .
» But the land you go to possess is a land of hills and valleys . It drinks water from the rain from the clouds in the sky .
» Jehovah your God cares about this land . Jehovah watches over it day after day and year by year .
» If you faithfully obey my commandments that I give you today , love Jehovah your God , and serve him with all your heart and with all your being ,
I will send rain on your land at the proper time , both in the fall and in the spring . You will gather your own grain , new wine , and olive oil .
» I will provide grass in the fields for your animals . You will be able to eat and be filled .
» Guard yourselves ! Your heart could be deceived . You could turn away and serve other gods and worship them .
» Jehovah will become angry with you . He will shut the sky and there will be no rain . Then the ground will not grow any crops . You will quickly disappear from this good land Jehovah is giving you .
» Take these words of mine to heart and keep them in mind . Write them down , tie them around your wrist , and wear them as headbands to remind you .
» Teach them to your children ! Talk about them in your home and away . Speak of them when you lie down or get up .
» Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates .
» You and your descendants will live a long time in the land that Jehovah promised your ancestors . Your families will live there as long as the sky is above the earth .
» Love Jehovah your God and obey all the laws and teachings I commanded you today . Hold fast to him .
» Then Jehovah will drive out all these nations from before you . You will drive out nations greater and mightier than you .
» Every place on which the sole of your foot treads will be yours . Your border will be from the wilderness to Lebanon , and from the river , the river Euphrates , as far as the western sea .
» No man will be able to stand before you . Jehovah your God will lay the dread of you and the fear of you on all the land where you set foot . This is as he promised you .
» See I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse :
» Receive the blessing when you listen to the commandments of Jehovah your God , which I command you today .
» Receive the curse when you do not listen to the commandments of Jehovah your God , but turn aside from the way that I command you today , by following other gods you have not known .
» When Jehovah your God brings you into the land you are about to possess , you will offer blessings on Mount Gerizim and cursing on Mount Ebal .
» Are they not across the Jordan toward the setting sun ? Are they in the land of the Canaanites who live in the Arabah , opposite Gilgal , beside the oaks big trees of Moreh ?
» You are about to cross the Jordan to go in to possess the land Jehovah your God is giving you . You must possess it and live in it ,
» Be careful to do all the statutes and judgments I present to you today .
» These are the statutes and the judgments you should carefully observe in the land Jehovah , the God of your fathers , has given you to possess as long as you live on the earth .
» Destroy all the places where the nations you dispossess serve their gods , on the high mountains and on the hills and under every green tree .
» Tear down their altars and smash their sacred pillars . Burn their Asherah poles with fire . Cut down the carved images of their gods and obliterate their name from that place .
» Do not worship Jehovah your God with such things .
» You should seek Jehovah at the place Jehovah your God chooses out of all your tribes . This is where he will dwell and establish his name . This is where you should go .
» There you shall bring your burnt offerings , your sacrifices , your tithes , and the contribution of your hand , your vowed offerings , your freewill offerings , and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock .
» You and your households should eat there before Jehovah your God , and rejoice in all your undertakings that Jehovah your God has blessed .
» Do not behave the way we do here today , every man doing whatever is right in his own eyes .
» For you have not as yet come to the resting place and the inheritance that Jehovah your God is giving you .
» When you cross the Jordan and live in the land Jehovah your God gives you to inherit , and he gives you rest from all your enemies around you so that you live in security .
» It will happen in the place Jehovah choose for his name to dwell , there you shall bring all that I command you . Bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices , your tithes and the contribution of your hand , and all your choice vowed offerings that you will vow to Jehovah .
» Rejoice be filled with joy before Jehovah your God , you and your sons and daughters , your male and female servants , and the Levite who is within your gates , since he has no portion or inheritance with you .

but in the place Jehovah chooses in one of your tribes , there you shall offer your burnt offerings , and there you shall do all that I command you .
» In whatever city you live , you may slaughter and eat as much meat as you want from what Jehovah your God has blessed you with . Clean and unclean people may eat it as if they were eating a gazelle or a deer .
» Never eat the blood . Pour it on the ground like water .
» You may not eat Jehovah’s offerings in your cities . Those offerings are : one-tenth of your grain , new wine , and olive oil ; the firstborn of your cattle , sheep , or goats ; the offerings you vow to bring ; your freewill offerings ; and your contributions .
» You and your sons and daughters , male and female slaves , and the Levites who live in your cities must eat these in the presence of Jehovah your God at the place he will choose . There in the presence of Jehovah your God enjoy everything for which you have worked .
» Remember to take care of the Levites as long as you live in your land .
» Jehovah your God will expand your country's borders as he promised . You will say : I am hungry for meat . Then eat as much meat as you want .
» If the place Jehovah your God chooses to put his name is too far away from you , you may slaughter an animal from the herds or flocks that Jehovah has given you . Eat as much as you want in your city . I have commanded you to do this .
» Eat it as you would eat a gazelle or a deer . Clean and unclean people may eat it together .
» Make sure you never eat blood , because blood contains life . Never eat the life with the meat .
» Never eat blood ! Pour it on the ground like water .

» Take the holy things and the offerings you have vowed to bring , and go to the place Jehovah will choose .
» Sacrifice the meat and the blood of your burnt offerings on the altar of Jehovah your God . The blood of your sacrifices is to be poured out beside the altar of Jehovah your God , but you may eat the meat .
» If you obey these laws , you will be doing what Jehovah your God says is right and good . Then he will help you and your descendants succeed .
» Israel , Jehovah will get rid of the nations you attack . You may have their land .
» Be careful that you are not ensnared to follow them , for they will be destroyed . Do not inquire after their gods , saying : How do these nations serve their gods that I also may do likewise ?
» Do not behave this way toward Jehovah your God , for every abominable act Jehovah hates they have done for their gods . They even burn their sons and daughters in the fire to their gods .
» Be careful to do what I command you . Do not add to it nor take away from it .
» If a prophet or an interpreter of dreams appears among you and gives you a sign or a wonder portent omen forecast of the future ,
in order to lead you to worship and serve gods that you have not worshiped before , and even if what they promise comes true ,
do not listen to them . Jehovah your God is allowing them to test you . He will then know that you love Jehovah with all your heart .
» Follow Jehovah and respect him . Obey him and keep his commandments . Worship him and be faithful to him stick to him stay close to him cleave , cling to him .
» Put to death any interpreters of dreams or prophets that tell you to rebel against Jehovah . For he Jehovah rescued you from Egypt , where you were slaves . Such people are evil and are trying to lead you away from the life that Jehovah has commanded you to live . They must be put to death , in order to get rid of this evil .
» If your brother , your mother's son , or your son or daughter , or the wife you cherish , or your very best friend tries to secretly entice you , saying : ‘ Let us go and serve other gods , gods neither you nor your fathers have known ,
» ‘ the gods of the people who are around you from one end of the earth to the other end . ’
» Do not yield to him or listen to him . Your eye should not have pity on him . You should not spare or conceal him .
» You must kill him ! Your hand should be first against him to put him to death , and afterwards the hand of all the people .
» Stone him to death because he has sought to draw you away from Jehovah your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt , out of the house of slavery .
» All Israel will hear and be afraid , and will never again do such a wicked thing among you .
» If you hear in one of the cities Jehovah has given you , anyone saying that
some worthless men have gone out from among you and have mislead the inhabitants of their city , saying : Let us go and serve other gods you have not known .
» Investigate and search out and inquire thoroughly . If it is true and the matter established that this abomination has been done among you ,
strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword , utterly destroying it and all that is in it and its cattle with the edge of the sword .
» Gather all its treasure into the middle of its open square and burn the city and all its treasure with fire as a whole burnt offering to Jehovah your God . It shall be a ruin forever . It shall never be rebuilt .
» Do not take anything that is put under ban . If you comply obey , Jehovah may turn from his burning anger and show mercy to you . He may have compassion on you and make you increase , just as he swore to your fathers .
» Listen to the voice of Jehovah your God . Obey all his commandments that I am commanding you today . Do what is right in the sight of Jehovah your God .
» You are the sons of Jehovah your God . Do not cut yourselves nor shave your forehead for the sake of the dead .
» You are a holy people to Jehovah your God . Out of all the people on the face of the earth Jehovah has chosen you to be a people for His own possession .
» Do not eat any detestable thing .

the deer , the gazelle , the roebuck , the wild goat , the ibex , the antelope chamois and the mountain sheep .
» You may eat any animal that divides the hoof and has the hoof split in two and chews the cud .
» Do not eat of these that chew the cud , or among those that divide the hoof in two : the camel and the rabbit and the shaphan . Even though they chew the cud , they do not divide the hoof . They are unclean for you .
» The pig , because it divides the hoof but does not chew the cud , it is unclean for you . Do not eat any of their flesh nor touch their carcasses .
» These you may eat of all that are in water : anything that has fins and scales you may eat .
» Do not eat anything that does not have fins and scales . It is unclean for you .
» You may eat any clean bird .
» These are the ones you should not eat : the eagle and the vulture and the buzzard ,
and the red kite , the falcon , and the kite in their kinds ,
and every raven in its kind ,
and the ostrich , the owl , the sea gull , and the hawk in their kinds ,
the swan , the great owl , the white owl ,
the pelican , the carrion vulture , the cormorant ,
the stork , and the heron in their kinds , and the hoopoe and the bat .
» And all the teeming life with wings is unclean to you . Do not eat them .
» You may eat any clean bird .
» Do not eat anything that dies by itself . You may give it to the alien who is in your town , so that he may eat it . You may sell it to a foreigner , for you are a holy people to Jehovah your God . Do not boil a young goat in its mother's milk .
» You shall surely tithe all the produce from what you sow , which comes out of the field every year .
» You shall eat in the presence of Jehovah your God , at the place where He chooses to establish his name , the tithe of your grain , your new wine , your oil , and the firstborn of your herd and your flock , so that you may learn to respect Jehovah your God always .
» The place Jehovah your God will choose to put his name may be too far away . He may bless you with so much that you cannot carry the tithe of your income that far .
» If so , exchange the tenth part of your income for silver . Take the silver with you , and go to the place Jehovah your God will choose .
Use the silver to buy whatever you want : cattle , sheep , goats , wine , liquor-whatever you choose . Then you and your family will eat and enjoy yourselves there in the presence of Jehovah your God .
» Do not neglect the Levites who live in your towns . They have no property of their own .
» At the end of every third year bring the tithe of all your crops and store it in your towns .
» This food is for the Levites , since they own no property , and for the foreigners , orphans , and widows who live in your towns . They are to come and get all they need . Do this , and Jehovah your God will bless you in everything you do .
» Release all debts at the end of every seven years .
» This is how you should release . Every man who has a loan to his neighbor shall release it . He shall not require it from his neighbor , or from his brother , because it is called Jehovah's release .
» You may collect from a foreigner , but your hand should release that debt which is yours with your brother .
» There should not be any poor people among you . Jehovah your God will certainly bless you in the land he is giving you as your own possession .
» He will bless you only if you listen carefully to Jehovah your God and faithfully obey all these commandments I give you today .
» Jehovah your God will bless you , as he promised . You will make loans to many nations . But you will not have to borrow from any of them . You will rule many nations . But no nation will ever rule over you .
» This is what you must do whenever there are poor Israelites in one of your cities in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you .
» Be generous to these poor people . Freely lend them as much as they need . Never be hardhearted and stingy with them .
» When the seventh year , the year when payments on debts are canceled , is near , you might be stingy toward poor Israelites and give them nothing . Be careful not to think these worthless thoughts . The poor will complain to Jehovah about you , and you will be condemned for your sin .
» Give the poor what they need , because then Jehovah will make you successful in everything you do .
» There will always be some Israelites who are poor and needy . That is why I am commanding you to be generous with them .
» If you buy Israelites your own brothers as slaves , you must set them free after six years .
» Do not send him away empty handed when you set him free .
» Supply him liberally from your flock and from your threshing floor and from your wine vat . Give to him as Jehovah your God has blessed you .
» Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt , and Jehovah your God redeemed you . Therefore I command you this today !
» If he says to you : I will not leave you . If it is because he loves you and your household , since he fares well with you ,
then you shall take an awl and pierce it through his ear into the door . He will be your servant for a very long time . You should do likewise to your maidservant .
» It should not seem hard to you when you set him free . After all he has given you six years with double the service of a hired man . Jehovah your God will bless you in whatever you do .

» Sacrifice the Passover to Jehovah your God from the flock and the herd , in the place where Jehovah chooses to establish his name .
» Do not eat leavened bread with it . Eat unleavened bread for seven days . It is the bread of affliction . You should remember all the days of your life the day when you came out of the land of Egypt in haste .
» No leaven should be seen with you in all your territory for seven days . None of the flesh you sacrifice on the evening of the first day shall remain overnight until morning .
» You are not allowed to sacrifice the Passover in any of your towns Jehovah your God is giving you .

» Three times a year all your men must come into the presence of Jehovah your God at the place he will choose . At the Festival of Unleavened Bread , the Festival of Weeks , and the Festival of Booths . But no one may come into the presence of Jehovah without an offering .
» Every man shall give , as he is able ; according to the blessing Jehovah your God has given you .
» Appoint judges and officers for your tribes in every city Jehovah your God gives you . They are to judge the people fairly .
» Never pervert justice . Always be impartial . Never take a bribe , because bribes blind wise people and deny justice to those who are in the right .
» Only strive for justice so you will live and take possession of the land that Jehovah your God is giving you .
» When you build the altar for Jehovah your God , never plant beside it any tree dedicated to the goddess Asherah .
» Never set up a sacred stone . These are things Jehovah your God hates .
» Never offer a bull or a sheep that has a defect or anything seriously wrong with it as a sacrifice to Jehovah your God . That is an abomination to him .
» In one of the cities Jehovah your God is giving you , there may be a man or woman among you who is doing what Jehovah considers evil . This person may be disregarding the conditions of Jehovah’s covenant .
» Some worship and bow down to other gods , the sun , the moon , or the whole army of heaven . I have forbidden this .
» If it is told you and you have heard of it , then you shall inquire thoroughly . If it is true and the thing certain that this detestable thing has been done in Israel ,
» Bring that man or woman who has done this evil deed out to your gates . Stone the man or the woman to death .
» On the evidence and testimony of two witnesses or three witnesses , he who is to die shall be put to death . He shall not be put to death on the evidence of one witness .
» The witnesses must throw the first stone to put him to death , and afterward all the people . So you shall purge the evil from your midst .
» If any case is too difficult for you to decide , between one kind of homicide or another , between one kind of lawsuit or another , and between one kind of assault or another , being cases of dispute in your courts , then you should go to the place Jehovah your God chooses .
» Approach the Levitical priest or the judge who is in office in those days . Inquire of them and they will declare to you the verdict in the case .
» Act according to the terms of the verdict they declare to you from that place Jehovah chooses . Be careful to abide by all that they teach you .
» Act according to the verdict and the terms they tell you . Do not turn away from the word they declare to you .
» The man who acts presumptuously and does not listen to the priest or the judge will die . This way you will purge the evil from Israel . The priests and judges are there to serve Jehovah your God .
» Then all the people will hear and be afraid . They will not act presumptuously again .
» Enter the land Jehovah your God gives you . Possess it and live in it . You will say : I will set a king over me like all the nations who are around me ,
you shall surely set a king over you whom Jehovah your God chooses . It will be one from among your countrymen . You may not put a foreigner over yourselves who is not your countryman .
» He must not increase his herd of horses . He must not send the people to return to Egypt to get more horses . For Jehovah said to you : You should never again return that way .
» He must not take many wives or his heart will turn astray . He must not accumulate large amounts of silver and gold .
» When he first sits on the throne of his kingdom , he is to write for himself a copy of this law on a scroll taken in the presence of the Levitical priests .
» He should keep it with him . He should read from it all the days of his life . In this way he will learn to respect Jehovah his God by carefully observing all the words of this Law and these statutes .
» He must not think he is better than the rest of his people . He will not disobey these commandments in any way . So he and his sons will rule for a long time in Israel .
» The Levitical priests including the entire tribe of Levi will receive no land or property of their own like the rest of the Israelites . They will eat what has been sacrificed to Jehovah . These sacrifices will be what they receive .
» They are to own no land , as the other tribes do . Their inheritance is the privilege of being Jehovah’s priests , as Jehovah told them .
» When cattle or sheep are sacrificed , the priests are to be given the shoulder , the jaw , and the stomach .
» They are to receive the first share of the grain , wine , olive oil , and wool .
» Jehovah chose from all your tribes the tribe of Levi to serve him and his sons as priests forever .

» He may serve there , as a priest of Jehovah his God , like the other Levites who are serving there .
» He is to receive the same amount of food as the other priests . He may keep everything his family sends him .
» When you come into the land that Jehovah your God gives you , do not follow the disgusting practices of the nations that are there .
» Do not sacrifice your children in the fires on your altars . Do not let your people practice divination or look for omens or use spells or charms .

» Jehovah your God hates people who do these disgusting things . That is why he is driving those nations out of the land as you advance .
» Be perfect without blemish with Jehovah your God .
» These nations whom you shall possess listened to observers of clouds and to diviners . As for you , Jehovah your God has not allowed you to do so .
» Jehovah your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your fellow Israelites . Listen to him !
» This is according to all that you asked of Jehovah your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly . You said : Let me not hear again the voice of Jehovah my God . Do not let me see this great fire anymore , or I will die .
» Jehovah said to me : ‘ They have spoken well .
» ‘ I will raise up a prophet from among their countrymen like you . I will put my words in his mouth . He will speak to them all that I command him .
» ‘ Whoever refuses to listen to the words that the prophet speaks in my name will answer to me .
» ‘ Any prophet who dares to say something in my name that I did not command him to say or who speaks in the name of other gods must die .
» ‘ « You may wonder : » How shall we recognize that Jehovah did not speak this message ? «
» If a prophet speaks in Jehovah’s name and what he says does not happen or come true , then it did not come from Jehovah . That prophet has spoken on his own authority . Never be afraid of him . ’
» When Jehovah your God destroys all the nations that are living in the land that he gives you . you will force them out and live in their cities and houses .
» When all this is done , set aside three cities in the land that Jehovah your God gives you .
» Provide a route to each of these cities and divide the land that Jehovah your God gives you into three regions . When a person kills someone he may run to one of these cities .
» A person who unintentionally kills someone he never hated in the past may run to one of these cities to save his life .
» For example : when a man goes into the forest with his friend to cut wood , and his hand swings the axe to cut down the tree , and the iron head slips off the handle and strikes his friend so that he dies . He may flee to one of these cities and live .
» Otherwise the avenger of blood might pursue the manslayer in the heat of his anger . He may overtake him and because the way is long he may take his life . Even though he was not deserving of death , since he had not hated him previously .
» Hear my command : ‘ You must set aside three cities for yourself . ’
» If Jehovah your God enlarges your territory , just as he has sworn to your fathers , and gives you all the land he promised to give your fathers .
» And if you carefully observe all this commandment I command you today , to love Jehovah your God , and to walk in his ways always you shall add three more cities for yourself , besides these three .
» Innocent blood will not be shed in your land that Jehovah your God gives you as an inheritance . Blood guiltiness will not be on you .
» But if there is a man who hates his neighbor and lies in wait for him and murders him . If he flees to one of these cities ,
» the elders of his city will send for him . They will take him from there and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood that he may die .
» Do not pity him . Purge the blood of the innocent from Israel that it may go well with you .
» Do not move your neighbor's boundary mark . The ancestors have set this in your inheritance . You will inherit this in the land Jehovah your God gives you to possess .
» One witness is not enough to convict someone of a crime , offense , or sin he may have committed . Cases must be settled based on the testimony of two or three witnesses .
» This is what you must do whenever a witness takes the stand to accuse a person falsely of a crime .
» The two people involved must stand in Jehovah’s presence , in front of the priests and judges who are serving at that time .
» The judges must make a thorough investigation . If it is found that the witness lied when he testified against the other Israelite ,
do to him what he planned to do to the other person . Get rid of this evil .
» When other people hear about this , they will be afraid . Never again will such an evil thing be done among you .
» Have no pity on him : Take a life for a life , an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth , a hand for a hand , and a foot for a foot .
» When you go to war against your enemies , you may see horses , chariots , and armies larger than yours . Do not be afraid of them for Jehovah your God , who brought you out of Egypt , will be with you .
» A priest must come and speak to the troops before the battle begins .
He should say : » Listen , Israel , today you are going into battle against your enemies . Do not lose your courage ! Do not be afraid . Do not tremble because of them .
» Jehovah your God is going with you . He will fight for you against your enemies and give you victory .
» The officers should speak to the army : If you have built a new house that has not been dedicated , you may go home . Otherwise , you might die in battle , and someone else will dedicate it .
» Have you planted a vineyard and not used its fruits ? Go home to your house and vineyard . If you die in battle another man will use its fruit .
» Is there anyone here engaged to be married ? If so , he should go home . Otherwise , if he is killed in battle , someone else will marry the woman he is engaged to .
» The officers will also say to the men : Is there any man here who has lost his nerve and is afraid ? If so , he is to go home . Otherwise , he will destroy the morale of the others .
» When the officers finish speaking to the army , leaders are to be chosen for each unit .
» When you go to attack a city , first give its people a chance to surrender .
» If they open the gates and surrender , they will all become your slaves and do forced labor for you .
» If the people of that city choose to fight and will not surrender , surround it with your army .
» When Jehovah your God lets you capture the city , kill every man in it .
» You may take the women , the children , the livestock , and everything else in the city for yourselves . You may use everything that belongs to your enemies . Jehovah has given it to you .
» This is what you must do to all the cities that are far away that do not belong to the nations nearby .
» Do not spare anyone's life in the cities of these nations Jehovah your God is giving you as your property .
» You must capture the Hittites , Amorites , Canaanites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites for Jehovah and completely destroy them . Jehovah your God commands you .
» Otherwise , they will teach you to do all the disgusting things they do for their gods . You will sin against Jehovah your God .
» This is what you must do whenever you blockade a city for a long time in order to capture it in war . Do not harm any of its fruit trees with an ax . You may eat the fruit . Never cut those trees down , because the trees of the field are not people you have come to blockade .
» You may destroy trees that you know are not fruit trees . You may cut them down and use them in your blockade until you capture the city .
» This is what you must do if you find a murder victim lying in a field in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you . If no one knows who committed the murder ,
your elders and judges must go and measure the distance from the body to each of the neighboring cities .
» When it is determined which city is nearest the body , the elders from that city must choose a heifer that has never been put to work and never worn a yoke .
» The elders of that city will bring the heifer down to a river , to a location where the land has not been plowed or planted . At the river they must break the heifer's neck .
» Then the priests , the sons of Levi , shall come near . Jehovah your God has chosen them to serve him and to bless in the name of Jehovah . They will settle every dispute and every assault .
» All the elders of the city that is nearest to the slain man shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley .
» They will answer : ‘ Our hands did not shed this blood , nor did we see it .
» ‘ Forgive your people Israel , whom you have redeemed , O Jehovah . Do not hold us responsible for the murder of an innocent person . ’ ’ Forgive them of bloodguilt .
» Remove the guilt of innocent blood from your midst . Do what is right in the eyes of Jehovah’s .
» When you go to war with your enemies and Jehovah your God hands them over to you , you may take them captive .
» If you see a beautiful woman among the captives and your heart is set on her , you may marry her .
» Take her to your home . She should shave her head and cut her nails .
» She should no longer wear the clothes she was wearing when you captured her . She may live in your house and mourn the loss of her father and mother for one month . After that you may marry her .
» Later if you are not happy with the woman you may divorce her . She may go free . But you have slept with her as your wife , so you cannot sell her as a slave or make her into your own slave .
» If a man have two wives and loves one more than the other . The first son of either wife is the man's first-born son , even if the boy's mother is the wife he does not love . A man near death and dividing up his property must give a double share to his first-born son . This is because he was the first to be born .
» The day he wills his possessions to his sons , he should not put the firstborn son of the loved wife before the firstborn son of the unloved wife .
» He should acknowledge the firstborn son of the unloved wife . And give him a double portion of all that he has . He is the beginning of his strength . The right of the firstborn belongs to him .
» If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not listen or obey his father or his mother when they chastise him ,
» His father and mother shall seize him , and bring him out to the elders of his city at the gateway of his hometown .
» They shall say to the elders of his city : This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious ! He will not obey us ! He is a glutton and a drunkard .
» All the men of his city shall stone him to death . In that way you will remove the evil from your midst . All Israel will hear about it and fear .
» If a man commits a sin worthy of death and he is put to death . You hang him on a tree stake .
» His corpse must not hang all night on the tree stake . Be sure to bury him the same day for he who is hanged is accursed of God . You do this so that you do not defile your land Jehovah your God gives you as an inheritance .
» If your brother’s bull or sheep stray do not ignore them . Bring them back to your brother .
» If you are not acquainted with your brother , or you just do not know him , then you should bring it home to your house . Keep it with you until your brother looks for it . Then you should give it to him .
» You should do the same with his donkey and his garment . You should do likewise with anything lost by your brother found by you . Do not ignore it .
» You should not see your brothers donkey or his bull fallen down on the way , and pay no attention to them . Help him lift it to its feet .

» If you find a bird's nest near the road , in a tree or on the ground , with young ones or eggs in it . The mother could be sitting on the young or on eggs . Do not take the mother with the young .
» Let the mother go . You may take the young . Let the mother go . May things go well with you and you may prolong your days .
» When you build a new house make a parapet wall for your roof . This way you will not bring bloodguilt on your house if anyone falls from it .
» Do not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed , or all the produce of the seed that you have sown and the increase of the vineyard will become defiled .
» Do not plow with a bull and a donkey together .
» Do not wear a material mixed with wool and linen together .

» If a man marries a woman and has sex with her and then turns against her ,
he charges her with shameful deeds and publicly defames her . He says : ‘ When I had sex with this woman , I did not find proof of her virginity . ’
» The girl's father and her mother must present evidence of the girl's virginity to the elders of the city at the gate .
» The girl's father shall say to the elders : I gave my daughter to be this man’s wife , but he turned against her .
» He has charged her with shameful deeds . He says : ‘ I did not find your daughter to be a virgin . « » But this is the evidence of my daughter's virginity . « And they shall spread the garment before the elders of the city .
» The elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him ,
» They will fine him a hundred shekels of silver . They will give it to the girl's father , because he publicly defamed a virgin of Israel . She will remain his wife . He may not divorce her all his days .
» On the other hand if this charge is true , that the girl was not found a virgin ,
they will take the girl to the doorway of her father's house . The men of her city shall stone her to death because she has committed an act of folly in Israel by playing the harlot in her father's house . You must purge the evil from among you .
» If a man is caught having sexual intercourse with another mans wife , then both of them shall die ! Both the man and the woman committing adultery must be killed . Thus you shall purge the evil from Israel .
» Suppose there is a girl who is a virgin engaged to a man , and another man has sexual relations with her .

» If an engaged woman is raped forced to experience sex only the man who commits the act will die .
» Do nothing to the woman . There is no sin in the woman worthy of death . This is like the case where a man attacks and murders his neighbor .

» No Ammonite or Moabite shall enter the assembly of Jehovah . Their descendants to the tenth generation shall not enter the assembly of Jehovah .
» This is because they did not meet you with food and water on the way when you came out of Egypt . It is because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia , to curse you .

» Everyone will look at you and your descendants and realize that Jehovah has placed you under a curse for a very long time .
» You did not serve Jehovah your God with joyfulness , and with gladness of heart , for the abundance of all things .
» You will serve your enemies whom Jehovah will send against you , in hunger , in thirst , in nakedness , and in the lack of all things . He will put an iron yoke on your neck until he has destroyed you .
» Jehovah will bring a nation against you from far away , from the end of the earth , as the eagle swoops down , a nation whose language you will not understand ,
a nation of fierce countenance who will have no respect for the old , nor show favor to the young .
» They will eat the offspring of your animals and the crops from your fields until you are destroyed . They will leave you no grain , no new wine , no olive oil , no calves from your herds , and no lambs or kids from your flocks . They will continue to do this until you are completely desolate .
» They will blockade all your cities until the high , fortified walls you trust come down everywhere in your land . They will blockade all the cities everywhere in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you .
» Because of the hardships your enemies will make you suffer during the blockade , you will eat the flesh of your own children , the sons and daughters , whom Jehovah your God has given you .
» The kindest and most sensitive man among you will become stingy toward his brother , the wife he loves , and the children he still has left .
» He will give none of them any of the flesh of his children that he is eating . It will be all that he has left . These are hardships your enemies will make you suffer during the blockade of all your cities .
» The kindest and most sensitive woman among you , so sensitive and tender that she would not even step on an ant , will become stingy toward the husband she loves or toward her own son or daughter .
» She will not share with them the afterbirth from her body and the children she gives birth to . She will secretly eat them out of dire necessity . These are hardships your enemies will make you suffer during the blockade of your cities .
» You might not faithfully obey every word of the teachings that are written in this book . You might not respect this glorious and awe inspiring name : JEHOVAH your God .
» If so , Jehovah will strike you and your descendants with unimaginable plagues . They will be terrible continuing plagues . They will be severe and lingering diseases .
» He will bring all the diseases of Egypt that you dreaded . They will cling to you .
» Jehovah will also bring you every kind of sickness and plague not written in this Book of the Law . They will continue until you are dead .
» You were at one time as numerous as the stars in the sky . But only a few of you will be left . This is because you did not obey Jehovah your God .
» Jehovah was very glad to make you prosperous and numerous . Now Jehovah will be more than glad to destroy you and wipe you out . You will be torn out of the land you are about to enter and possess .
» Jehovah will scatter you among all the people of the world . He will scatter you from one end of the earth to the other . There you will serve gods made of wood and stone that neither you nor your ancestors ever knew .
» You will find no peace among those nations . There will be no place to call your own . There Jehovah will give you an unsettled mind , failing eyesight , and despair .
» Your life will always be in danger . Day and night you will be filled with terror . You will live in constant fear of death .
» Your hearts will pound with fear at everything you see . Every morning you will wish for evening . Every evening you will wish for morning .
» Jehovah will send you back to Egypt in ships , even though he said that you would never have to go there again . There you will try to sell yourselves to your enemies as slaves . But no one will want to buy you .
These are the terms of the covenant that Jehovah commanded Moses to make with the people of Israel in the land of Moab . All this was in addition to the covenant Jehovah made with them at Mount Sinai .
Moses called together all the people of Israel and said : » You saw for yourselves what Jehovah did to the king of Egypt , to his officials , and to his entire country .
» You saw the terrible plagues , the miracles , and the great wonders that Jehovah performed .
» To this very day Jehovah has not given you a heart to know , eyes to see , or ears to hear .
» I led you forty years in the wilderness . Your clothes have not worn out on you . Your sandal has not worn out on your foot .
» You have not eaten bread . You have not drunk wine or strong drink . This in order that you might know that I am Jehovah your God .
When you reached this place , Sihon the king of Heshbon and Og the king of Bashan came out to meet us for battle . We defeated them !
» We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites , the Gadites , and the half-tribe of the Manassites .
» Keep the words of this covenant to do them that you may prosper in all that you do .
» You stand today , all of you , before Jehovah your God : your leaders , your tribes , your elders and your officers , even all the men of Israel .
» Your little ones , your wives , and the alien who is within your camps , from the one who chops your wood to the one who draws your water ,
that you may enter into the covenant with Jehovah your God , and into His oath that Jehovah your God is making with you today .
» Jehovah will confirm today with this promise that you are his people and that he is your God . This is what he told you . This is what he promised your ancestors Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob with an oath .
» You are not the only people to receive this promise and its conditions .
» It is for those of you who are standing here with us today in the presence of Jehovah our God and also for those who are not here today .
» You know how we lived in Egypt and how we passed through other countries on our way here .
» You saw their loathsome idols made of wood , stone , silver , and gold .
» Make sure that no man , woman , family , or tribe standing here today turns from Jehovah our God to serve the gods of other nations . This would be like a root that grows to be a bitter and poisonous plant .
» Be sure there is no one here today who hears these solemn demands and yet convinces himself that all will be well with him . He would go stubbornly on his own way . That would destroy all of you , good and evil alike .
Jehovah will never be willing to forgive him , but rather the anger of Jehovah and His jealousy will burn against that man . Every curse which is written in this book will rest on him . Jehovah will blot out his name from under heaven .
» Jehovah will destroy you by piling on you all the curses that are written in this book of Law . You will be forgotten forever .
» The next generation of your children and foreigners who come from distant countries will see the plagues that have happened in this land and the diseases Jehovah sent here .
» All its land is brimstone and salt . It is a burning waste , unsown and unproductive . No grass grows on it . Like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah , Admah and Zeboiim , which Jehovah overthrew in his anger and in his wrath .
» All the nations will say : Why has Jehovah done thus to this land ? Why this great outburst of anger ? '
» Then men will say : ‘ Because they forsook the covenant of Jehovah , the God of their fathers , which he made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt .
» ‘ They served other gods and worshiped them . These are gods whom they have not known and whom he had not allotted to them .
» ‘ Jehovah became angry against this land and brought on it all the curses described in this book .
» ‘ His fierce anger and fury caused Jehovah to uproot these people from their land and deported them to another country . This is where they still are today . ’
» Some secret things are hidden . They belong to Jehovah our God . The things that have been revealed in these teachings belong to us and to our children forever . We must obey every word of this Law .
» All these blessings and curses I have spoken about will happen to you . Take them to heart when you are among all the nations where Jehovah your God will scatter you .
» If you and your children return to Jehovah your God and obey him with all your heart and with all your being , doing everything I command you today ,
he will restore your fortunes . He will have mercy on you and gather you from all the nations of the world where he has scattered you .
» Jehovah your God will gather you from the ends of the earth . He will bring you back .
» Jehovah your God will bring you into the land your fathers possessed . You will possess it . He will prosper you and multiply you more than your fathers .
» Jehovah your God will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants , to LOVE JEHOVAH YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART AND WITH ALL YOUR BEING , that you may live .
» Jehovah your God will inflict all these curses on your enemies and on those who hate you and who persecute you .
» You shall again obey Jehovah , and observe all his commandments that I command you today .
» Jehovah your God will prosper you abundantly in all the work of your hand . In the offspring of your body and in the offspring of your cattle and in the produce of your ground , you will prosper . Jehovah will again rejoice over you for good , just as he rejoiced over your fathers ;
if you obey Jehovah your God to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law , if you turn to Jehovah your God with all your heart with all your being .
» This commandment that I command you today is not too difficult for you . It is not out of reach .
» It is not in heaven , that you should say : Who will go up to heaven for us to get it for us and make us hear it , that we may obey it ?
» This commandment is not on the other side of the sea . You do not have to ask : Who will cross the sea to get it for us so that we can hear it and obey it ?
» No , these words are very near you . They are in your mouth and in your heart so that you will obey them .
» I set before you today life and good , death and evil .
» I command you today to Love Jehovah your God , follow his directions , and obey his commandments , laws , and rules . Then you will live , your population will increase , and Jehovah your God will bless you in the land that you are about to enter and possess .
» If your hearts turn away , and you do not listen , you might be tempted to bow down to other gods and worship them .
» If you do , I tell you today that you will certainly be destroyed . You will not live for a long time in the land that you are about to possess when you cross the Jordan River .
» I call on heaven and earth as witnesses today that I have offered you life or death , blessings or curses . Choose life so that you and your descendants will live .
» LOVE JEHOVAH YOUR GOD , OBEY HIM , AND BE LOYAL TO HIM . THIS WILL BE YOUR WAY OF LIFE . It will mean a long life for you in the land that Jehovah swore to give to your ancestors Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob .
Moses continued to speak to all the Israelites :
» I am one hundred and twenty years old now . I am not able to lead you anymore . Jehovah has told me that I may not cross the Jordan River .
» Jehovah your God is the one who will cross the river ahead of you . He will destroy those nations as you arrive . You will take possession of their land . Joshua will also cross the river ahead of you , as Jehovah told you .
» Jehovah will destroy those people , just as he defeated Sihon and Og , kings of the Amorites , and destroyed their country .
» Jehovah will give you victory over them . You are to treat them exactly as I have told you .
» Be determined and with good courage . Do not be afraid of them . Your God , Jehovah , will be with you . He will not fail you or abandon you .
Then Moses called Joshua and said to him in the presence of all the people of Israel : » Be determined and with good courage . You are the one who will lead these people to occupy the land Jehovah promised to their ancestors .
» Jehovah is the one who goes ahead of you . He will be with you . He will not fail you or forsake you . Do not fear or be downhearted . «
Moses wrote this Law and gave it to the priests , the sons of Levi who carried the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah , and to all the elders of Israel .
Moses commanded them : » At the end of every seven years , at the time of the year of remission of debts , at the Feast of Booths ,
when all Israel comes to appear before Jehovah your God at the place he will choose , you shall read this Law in front of all Israel in their hearing .
» Assemble the people , the men and the women and children and the alien who is in your town . Assemble them that they may hear and learn and respect Jehovah your God , and be careful to observe all the words of this Law .
» Their children , who have not known , will hear and learn to respect Jehovah your God , as long as you live on the land you will possess when you cross the Jordan River .
Then Jehovah said to Moses : » Behold , the time for you to die is near . Call Joshua , and present yourselves at the tent of meeting , that I may commission him . « So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves at the tent of meeting .
Jehovah appeared in the tent in a pillar of cloud . The pillar of cloud stood at the doorway of the tent .
Jehovah said to Moses : » You are about to lie down with your fathers in death . This people will arise and play the harlot with the strange gods of the land . They will plunge into the midst of it . They will forsake me and break my covenant that I made with them .
» ‘ My anger will be kindled against them in that day . I will abandon them and hide my face from them . They will be consumed by many evils and troubles . They will say in that day : ‘ Is it because our God is not among us that these evils have come upon us ? ’
» I will surely hide my face in that day because of all the evil they will do . They will turn to other gods .
» Write this song for yourselves , and teach it to the sons of Israel . Put it on their lips , so that this song may be a witness for me against the sons of Israel .
» When I bring them into the land flowing with milk and honey , which I swore to their fathers , and they have eaten and are satisfied and become prosperous , then they will turn to other gods and serve them , and spurn me and break my covenant .
» Then it will happen , when many evils and troubles have come upon them , that this song will testify before them as a witness . It shall not be forgotten from the lips of their descendants . I know the intent they are developing today , before I have brought them into the land that I swore . «
So Moses wrote this song the same day , and taught it to the sons of Israel .
Jehovah gave this command to Joshua , son of Nun : » Be strong and courageous , because you will bring the Israelites into the land that I swore to give them , and I will be with you . «
Moses finished writing all the words of this Law in a book .
He gave this command to the Levites who carried the Ark of Jehovah’s Covenant :
» Take this Book of the Law , and put it next to the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah your God , where it will be a witness against you .
» I know how rebellious you are . You are impossible to deal with . While I am alive and still with you , you are rebelling against Jehovah . How much more rebellious will you be after I die ?
» Assemble all the elders of your tribes and your officers in front of me . As they listen , I will speak these words and call on heaven and earth to testify against them .
» I know that after I die you will become thoroughly corrupt and turn from the way I have commanded you to live . In the days to come disasters will happen to you because you will make Jehovah furious by doing what he considers evil . «
The whole congregation of Israel listened . Moses recited all the words of this song :
» Give ear , O physical heavens , and I will speak ; and hear , O earth , the words of my mouth .
» My instruction shall drop as the rain ; my words shall descend like dew , as the gentle rains on the tender plant , and as the showers on vegetation .
» I will proclaim the name of Jehovah and ascribe greatness to our God .
» He is the Rock ! His work is perfect . For all His ways are just . He is a God of faithfulness and without evil . He is just and upright .
» They have corrupted themselves ; they are not His sons . They are a blemished , crooked and perverse generation .
» Is this how you repay Jehovah , you foolish and unwise people ? Is he not your Father and creator , who made you and formed you ?
» Remember the days of old . Think about all the past generations . Ask your fathers to remind you , and your elders to tell you .
» When the Most High gave nations their inheritance , when he divided the descendants of Adam , he set up borders for the tribes corresponding to the number of the sons of Israel .
» Jehovah’s people were his property . Jacob was God’s own possession .
» He found his people in a desert land , in a barren place where animals howl . He guarded them , took care of them , and protected them because they were the precious apple pupil of his eye .
» Like an eagle that stirs up its nest and hovers over its young , spreads its wings to catch them , and carries them on its wings ,
» Jehovah alone led his people . No foreign god was with them .
» He made him ride on the heights of the earth and fed him with the produce of the fields . He gave him honey from rocks and olive oil from solid rock .
» He ate cheese from cows and drank milk from sheep and goats . He gave them fat the best from the flock from lambs , rams from the stock of Bashan , male goats , and the best wheat . He drank the blood-red wine of grapes .
» Jeshurun Israel grew fat and disrespectful . You got fat ! You were stuffed ! You over eat ! He abandoned the God who made him and scornfully treated the rock of his salvation .
» They made God furious because they worshiped foreign gods and angered him stirred up his zeal because they worshiped worthless idols .
» They sacrificed to demons that are not God . They served gods they did not know . These were new gods who came from nearby , gods your ancestors never worshiped .
» You ignored the rock that fathered you and forgot the God who gave you life .
» Jehovah saw this and rejected them . His own sons and daughters made him angry .
» He said : ‘ I will turn away from them and find out what will happen to them . They are a devious and perverse generation . They are children who have no faith .
» They made him furious because they worshiped foreign gods . They angered him because they worshiped worthless idols . So I will use those who are not my people to make them jealous and a nation of godless fools to make them angry .
My anger has started a fire that will burn into the depths of the grave . It will consume the earth and its crops and set the foundations of the mountains on fire .
» I will heap distress on them ! I will use my arrows on them .
» They will be wasted by famine , and consumed by plague and bitter destruction . I will send teeth of wild animals on them , with the venom of crawling things reptiles of the dust .
» Outside the sword will bereave . Inside terror shall destroy both young man and virgin , babies and old man with gray hair .
» I would have said : ‘ I will cut them to pieces . I will remove the memory of them from men . ’
» I did not want their enemies to make me angry . I did not want their opponents to misunderstand and say : We won this victory ! Jehovah did not do all this !
» My people have lost their good sense . They do not understand .
They fail to see why they were defeated . They cannot understand what happened .
» Why were a thousand defeated by one ? Why ten thousand by only two ? Jehovah their God abandoned them ! Their mighty God gave them up .
» Their rock is not like our rock ! Their enemies know that their own gods are weak , not mighty like Israel's God .
» Their vine is like the vine of Sodom . Their fields are like Gomorrah . Their grapes are grapes of anger . Their clusters are bitter .
» Their wine is the poison of serpents , and the cruel venom of asps cobras .
» Is this not laid up in store with me and sealed up among my treasures ?
» Vengeance and retribution belong to me . Vengeance is mine , I will repay . Their foot shall slide in time , for the day of their calamity is at hand . The things to come on them come quickly .
» Jehovah will bring his people justice . He will have compassion on his servants . He sees that their power is gone , and only the imprisoned and abandoned remain .
» He will say : ‘ Where are their gods , the rock in which they sought refuge ?
» Who ate the fat of their sacrifices ? Who drank the wine of their drink offering ? Let them rise up and help you . Let them be your hiding place !
» See now that I , even I , am he . There is no god besides me ! It is I who put to death and give life . I have wounded and it is I who heals . There is no one who can deliver from my hand .
» Indeed , I lift up my hand to heaven , and say : As I live forever ,
» I sharpen my flashing sword , and my hand takes hold on justice ! I will render vengeance on my adversaries . I will repay those who hate me .
» I will make my arrows drunk with blood . My sword will devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the captives , from the longhaired leaders of the enemy .
» Rejoice you nations with his people . He will avenge the blood of his servants . He will render vengeance on his adversaries , and will atone for his land and his people . «
Then Moses came , along with Joshua son of Nun , and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people .
When Moses finished speaking all these words to all Israel ,
he said to them : » Take to your heart all the words with which I am warning you today . Command your sons to observe carefully all the words of this law .
» It is not an idle talk ! Indeed it is your life . By this word you will prolong your days in the land you to possess on the other side of the Jordan . «
Jehovah spoke to Moses that same day . He said :
» Go up to this mountain of the Abarim , Mount Nebo . It is in the land of Moab opposite Jericho . Look at the land of Canaan . I am giving this to the sons of Israel for a possession .
» Then die on the mountain you climb . Be gathered to your people , as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people ,
» You broke faith with me among the sons of Israel at the waters of Meribah-kadesh , in the wilderness of Zin . You did not treat me as holy among of the sons of Israel .
» You will see the land at a distance , but you will not go into the land I am giving the sons of Israel . «
These are the blessings that Moses , the man of God , pronounced on the people of Israel before he died :
» Jehovah came from Mount Sinai . He rose like the sun over Edom and shone on his people from Mount Paran . Ten thousand angels were with him . A flaming fire was at his right hand .
» Jehovah loves his people . All Your holy ones are in your hand . They followed in your steps and everyone receives your words .
» Moses commanded us with a law these teachings , a heritage of the assembly of Jacob .
» He was king in Jeshurun Israel when the leaders and all the tribes of the people of Israel were gathered .
» Do not let his men be few . «
» Hear , O Jehovah , the voice of Judah , and bring him to his people . With his hands he contended for them . May you Jehovah be help against his adversaries . «
» Let Your Thummim and Your Urim belong to your godly man , whom you tested at Massah and with whom you contended at the waters of Meribah .
» Who said of his father and mother : ‘ I have not seen them ; and he did not acknowledge his brothers , nor did he regard his own sons . They observed your word and kept your covenant . ’
» They will teach your ordinances to Jacob , and your Law to Israel . They will burn incense before you , and whole burnt offerings on your altar .
» O Jehovah , bless his skills and accept the work of his hands . Shatter the loins of those who rise up against him and those who hate him , so that they will not rise again . «
» May the beloved of Jehovah dwell in security by him who shields him all the day . He dwells between his shoulders . «
» Blessed of Jehovah is his land . Bless it with the dew from heaven above and with the deep waters lying below .
» Bless with the choice yield of the sun , and with the bounty produced each month .
» Bless with the best things of the ancient mountains , and with the choice things of the everlasting hills .
» Bless with the choice things of the earth and its fullness . Let the favor of him who dwelt in the bush come to the head of Joseph and to the crown of the head of the one distinguished among his brothers .
» As the firstborn of his bulls , majesty is his . His horns are the horns of the wild bull . With them he will push the peoples , all at once , to the ends of the earth . They are the ten thousands of Ephraim and the thousands of Manasseh . «
» Rejoice Zebulun in your going out . And rejoice Issachar in your tents .
» They will call peoples to the mountain . There they will offer righteous sacrifices . They will draw out the abundance of the seas and the hidden treasures of the sand . «
» Blessed is the one who enlarges Gad . He lies down as a lion and tears the arm , also the crown of the head .
» He provided the first part for himself . There the ruler's portion was reserved . He came with the leaders of the people and executed his ordinance of Israel and the justice of Jehovah . «
» Dan is a lion's cub . He leaps forth from Bashan . «
» O Naphtali , satisfied with favor , and full of the blessing of Jehovah , take possession of the sea and the south . «
» Asher is the most blessed with sons . May his brothers favor him . And may he dip his foot in oil .
» Your locks will be iron and bronze . According to your days , so will your leisurely walk be .
» There is none like the God of Jeshurun Israel . He rides the heavens to give you help . He goes through the skies in his majesty .
» The eternal God is a dwelling place . Underneath are the everlasting arms . He drove out the enemy from before you , and said : ‘ Destroy ! ’
» Israel dwells in security . The fountain of Jacob is secluded in a land of grain and new wine . His heavens also drop down dew .
» You are blessed O Israel . Who is like you , a people saved by Jehovah ? He is the shield of your help and the sword of your majesty ! So your enemies will cringe before you and you will tread upon their high places . «
Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo , to the top of Pisgah , which is opposite Jericho . Jehovah showed him all the land , Gilead as far as Dan ,
and all Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh , and all the land of Judah as far as the western sea ,
and the Negev and the plain in the valley of Jericho , the city of palm trees , as far as Zoar .
Jehovah said : » This is the land that I swore to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , saying : I will give it to your descendants . I let you see it with your eyes , but you shall not go over there . «
Moses the servant of Jehovah died there in the land of Moab , according to the word of Jehovah .
He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab , opposite Beth-peor . No man knows his burial place to this day .
Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died . His eye was not dim , nor his vigor abated .
So the sons of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days . Then the days of weeping and mourning for Moses came to an end .
Joshua the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom , for Moses had laid his hands on him . The sons of Israel listened to him and did as Jehovah had commanded Moses .
Since that time no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses , whom Jehovah knew face to face intimately ,
for all the signs and wonders that Jehovah sent him to perform in the land of Egypt against Pharaoh , all his servants , and all his land ,
and for all the great wonders and mighty power which Moses performed in the sight of all Israel .
Moses the servant of Jehovah died . After his death Jehovah spoke to Joshua the son of Nun , Moses’ minister , saying :
» Moses my servant is dead . Arise and cross over the Jordan River . Take the people into the land given to them , even to the children of Israel .
» I give you every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon just as I promised Moses .
» From the wilderness and nearby Lebanon even to the great river , the river Euphrates , all the land of the Hittites , and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun to the west , shall be your coast .
» No man will be able to resist you all the days of your life . Just as I was with Moses I will be with you . I will not fail you nor forsake you .
» Be strong and courageous for you will help this people inherit the land . This is the land I swore to give to their fathers .
» Be strong and very courageous , that you may be careful to do according to all the Law , which Moses my servant commanded you . Do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left , that you may prosper wherever you go .
» This Book of the Law will not depart out of your mouth . You must meditate intensely study think deeply on it day and night , that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it . Then you will make your way prosperous , and then you will have good success .
» Have I commanded you ? Be strong and of a good courage . Do not be afraid , neither be dismayed ; for Jehovah your God is with you wherever you go . «
Joshua commanded the officers of the people . He said :
» Pass through the middle of the camp and command the people , say : Prepare your provisions . In three days you will pass over this Jordan . You will go in to possess the land that Jehovah your God gave you to possess . «
And to the Reubenites , and to the Gadites , and to half the tribe of Manasseh , Joshua said :
» Remember the word Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you : ‘ Jehovah your God has given you rest , and has given you this land . ’ «
» Your wives , your little ones , and your cattle , shall remain in the land Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan . But you shall pass before your brothers armed , all the mighty men of valor , and help them .
» Your brothers will possess the land Jehovah gave them until Jehovah gives your brothers rest . Then you will return to the land you possess and enjoy it . This is the land Jehovah’s servant Moses gave you on this side of Jordan toward the sunrise to the east . «
They answered Joshua : » All that you command us we will do . Wherever you send us we will go .
» Just as we listened to Moses in all things , we will listen to you in all things . May Jehovah your God be with you , as he was with Moses .
» Whoever rebels against your commandment , and does not listen to your words in all that you command him must be put to death . Be strong and of a good courage . «
Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly . He said : » Go view the land of Jericho . « They went to a prostitute named Rahab , and stayed at her house .
The king of Jericho was told : » Men of the children of Israel came here tonight to search out the country . «
The king of Jericho sent for Rahab , saying : » Bring the men that came to you and stayed at your house . They came to spy on all the country . «
The woman took the two men , and hid them . She said : » Men came to me but I did not know where they came from . «
When it was dark and they shut the gate the men went out . I do not know where they went . Pursue them quickly and you will overtake them .
She hid them on the rooftop of the house . She covered them with stalks of flax , which she had laid in order on the roof .
The men pursued them by the road to Jordan to the fords . As soon the pursuers went out they shut the gate .
Before they laid down to sleep she came up to them on the roof .
She said to the men : » I know Jehovah has given you the land and the terror of you has fallen on us . All the inhabitants of the land are afraid of you .
» We heard how Jehovah dried up the water of the Red sea for you when you came out of Egypt . And what you did to the two kings of the Amorites that were on the other side of Jordan , Sihon and Og , whom you utterly destroyed .
» As soon as we heard these things we became discouraged . No man had courage because of you . Jehovah your God is God in heaven above and on earth below .
» I pray that you will swear to me by Jehovah , since I have showed you kindness that you will also show kindness to my father’s house , and give me a true token sign pledge of truth ;
» That you will save alive my father , and my mother , and my brothers and sisters , and all that they have , and deliver our lives from death . «
The men answered her : » Our life for yours , if you do not reveal our business . It will be , when Jehovah has given us the land . We will deal kindly and truly with you . «
Then she let them down by a cord through the window for her house was upon the town wall . She lived on the wall .
She said : » Go to the mountain , lest the pursuers meet you . Hide yourselves there three days , until the pursuers return and afterward go your way . «
The men said to her : » We will be free from this oath you made us swear .
» When we come into the land , tie this scarlet cord in the window from which you let us down . Bring your father , mother , brothers and sisters and your father’s entire household into your home .
» Whoever goes out of your house into the street will be responsible for his own life . We will be guiltless : and whoever shall be with you in the house , his blood shall be on our head , if any hand is laid on him .
» If you tell what we are doing we will be released from the oath you made us swear . «
She said : » Let it be according to your words . « They departed and she tied the scarlet line in the window .
They went to the mountain and stayed there three days until the pursuers returned . The pursuers looked for them everywhere but did not find them .
So the two men descended from the mountain . They returned to Joshua the son of Nun and told him all the things that happened to them .
They said to Joshua : » Truly Jehovah has delivered into our hands all of the land . The inhabitants of the country are afraid of us . «
Joshua rose early in the morning . They left Shittim for Jordan . He and all the children of Israel lodged there before they crossed over .
After three days the officers went through the camp .
They commanded the people , saying : » When you see the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah your God , and the priests the Levites bearing it , you should leave here and follow it .
» You should keep a space of a thousand yards between you and the ark . Do not come near it , that you may know the way by which you must go : for you have not passed this way before . «
Joshua said to the people : » Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow Jehovah will do amazing things among you . «
Joshua spoke to the priests : » Take up the Ark of the Covenant , and pass over before the people . « So they took the Ark of the Covenant and went before the people .
Jehovah said to Joshua : » This day will I begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel . Now they may know that , as I was with Moses , so I will be with you .
» You will command the priests that bear the Ark of the Covenant , saying : ‘ When you come to the shore of the Jordan River you will stand still in the Jordan . ’ «
Joshua said to the children of Israel : » Come here and hear the words of Jehovah your God . «
Joshua said : » By this you shall know the living God is among you , and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Hivites , and the Perizzites , and the Girgashites , and the Amorites , and the Jebusites .
» The Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah the God of all the earth passed over before you into Jordan .
» Take twelve men out of the tribes of Israel .
» As soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the Ark of Jehovah , the Lord of all the earth , set foot in the Jordan the waters of Jordan shall be cut off and they shall stand in a heap . «
When the people set out from their camp to cross the Jordan , and the priests bearing the Ark of the Covenant before the people and
As they carried the ark into the Jordan and the feet of the priests dipped into the water , for Jordan is at food stage at the time of harvest .
The waters stood and rose up upon a heap very far from the city Adam that is beside Zaretan . The waters that came down toward the sea of the plain , even the salt sea , failed , and were cut off . The people passed over the Jericho .
The priests carrying the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan River . All the Israelites passed over the Jordan River on dry ground .
All the people finished crossing the Jordan River . Then Jehovah spoke to Joshua :
Take twelve men out of the people . Take a man out of every tribe .
Command them by saying : » Take twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan , out of the place where the priests’ feet stood firm . Carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where you stay tonight . «
Then Joshua called the twelve men , whom he had prepared from the children of Israel , a man from every tribe .
Joshua said to them : » Pass over before the Ark of Jehovah your God to the middle of the Jordan River . Let every man take a stone on his shoulder according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel .
» This may be a sign among you when your children ask their fathers what is the meaning of these stones ?
» You will answer them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah . When it passed over Jordan , the waters of the Jordan were cut off . These stones will be for a memorial to the children of Israel for as long as they live . «
The children of Israel did as Joshua commanded , and took up twelve stones out of the middle of the Jordan . This was just as Jehovah spoke to Joshua , according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel . They carried them to the place where they lodged and laid them down there .
Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan River , in the place where the feet of the priests who carried the Ark of the Covenant stood , and they are there to this day .
The priests who carried the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan River . They stood there until every thing that Jehovah commanded Joshua to speak to the people was carried out , according to all that Moses commanded Joshua . During this time the people hurried to the other side of the river .
All the people crossed over . Then the priests , in the presence of the people , carried the Ark of Jehovah across .
The children of Reuben , and the children of Gad , and half the tribe of Manasseh , passed over armed before the children of Israel , as Moses spoke to them .
About forty thousand , prepared for war , passed over before Jehovah to do battle in the plains of Jericho .
On that day Jehovah exulted Joshua in the sight of all Israel . They feared him , as they feared Moses , all the days of his life .
Jehovah spoke to Joshua , saying :
» Command the priests who carry the Ark of the Testimony that they come up from the Jordan . «
Joshua therefore commanded the priests , saying : » Come up from the Jordan . «
When the priests that carried the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah were up out of the middle of the Jordan , and the soles of the priests’ feet were lifted up onto the dry land that the waters of Jordan returned to their place , and flowed over all its banks , as they did before .
The people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month , and encamped in Gilgal , in the east border of Jericho .
Joshua set up the twelve stones they took out of the Jordan River , in Gilgal .
He spoke to the children of Israel : » When your children will ask their fathers in time to come , what these stones mean ?
» Then you will let your children know , saying : Israel came over this Jordan River on dry land .
» For Jehovah your God dried up the waters of the Jordan for you , until you all crossed over . As Jehovah your God did to the Red sea , which he dried up from before us , until we crossed over .
» That all the people of the earth might know the hand of Jehovah is mighty : that you might reverence Jehovah your God forever . «
When all the kings of the Amorites , on the west side of the Jordan River and all the kings of the Canaanites , who were by the sea , heard that Jehovah dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel , until we passed over , their hearts grew faint with fear . They were discouraged because of the children of Israel .
Jehovah said to Joshua : » Make sharp knives , and circumcise the men of Israel . «
Joshua made sharp knives , and circumcised the men of Israel at the Hill of Circumcision .
This is why Joshua circumcised : All the men who came out of Egypt including all the men of war , died in the wilderness by the way , after they came out of Egypt .
Now all the people that came out were circumcised . But all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came out of Egypt were not circumcised .
The children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness , until all the people that were men of war , which came out of Egypt , were consumed , because they did not obey the voice of Jehovah . Jehovah swore that he would not show them the land , which he swore to their fathers that he would give us , a land that flows with milk and honey .
Joshua circumcised their children , whom he raised up in their place . They had not circumcised them in the wilderness .
When they were done circumcising all the people they stayed in the camp till they were healed .
Jehovah said to Joshua : » This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you . « So the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day .
The children of Israel encamped in Gilgal , and kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho .
After the Passover they ate the old corn of the land , unleavened cakes , and parched corn .
The manna ceased the morning after they ate the old corn of the land . The children of Israel had no more manna . But they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year .
When Joshua was by Jericho , he lifted up his eyes and looked , and , there stood a man in front of him with his sword drawn in his hand . Joshua went to him , and said : » Are you on our side or our adversaries ? «
He said : » No , but as captain of the camp of Jehovah I now come . « And Joshua fell on his face to the earth , and bowed down and said : » What does my lord say to his servant ? «
The captain commander of Jehovah’s host army said to Joshua : » Take your shoes from your feet , for the place where you stand is holy . « And at once Joshua did so .
Now Jericho was tightly shut up because the people were afraid of the children of Israel . No one went out , and no one came in .
Jehovah said to Joshua : » See , I have given into your hand Jericho , and the king there , and the mighty men of valor .
» March around the city with all your armed men . Go around the city once per day for six days .
» Seven priests will carry before you seven trumpets of rams’ horns along with the Ark . On the seventh day march around the city seven times . The priests shall blow the trumpets .
» When you hear a long blast with the ram’s horn , all the people will shout with a great shout . The wall of the city will fall down flat , and the people will go up , every man straight in to the city . «
Joshua the son of Nun called the priests , and said to them : » Take up the Ark of the Covenant . Seven priests should carry seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the Ark of Jehovah . «
He said to the people : » Pass on , and circle the city , and let him that is armed pass on before the Ark of Jehovah . «
As soon as Joshua spoke to the people the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams’ horns passed before Jehovah . They blew the trumpets and the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah followed them .
The armed men marched ahead of the priests that blew the trumpets , and the rear guard followed the Ark . All the time the priests kept blowing the trumpets .
Joshua commanded the people , saying : » You will not shout , nor make any noise with your voice , neither will any word proceed out of your mouth , until the day I bid you shout . Then you will shout . «
So the Ark of Jehovah went around the city one time . They came to the camp , and stayed in the camp .
Joshua rose early in the morning . The priests picked up the Ark of Jehovah .
Seven priests carrying seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the Ark of Jehovah went on continually , and blew with the trumpets . The armed men went before them . The rear guard followed the Ark of Jehovah . The priests were blowing the trumpet .
And the second day they went around the city once , and returned to the camp . They did this for six days .
They rose early at dawn on the seventh day . They circled the city in the same manner . Only on that day they went around the city seven times .
On the seventh time when the priest blew the trumpets , Joshua said to the people : » Shout for Jehovah has given you the city .
» The city and everything in it will be destroyed . It belongs to Jehovah . Only Rahab the harlot and all who are with her in her house will live . Because she hid the messengers we sent .
» You people must stay away from anything devoted to destruction . You should not take things from the city . You will cause trouble for the camp of Israel is you take of the accursed things .
» All the silver , and gold , and vessels of brass and iron , are consecrated to Jehovah . They must come into the treasury of Jehovah . «
So the people shouted when the priests blew the trumpets . When the people heard the sound of the trumpet , and the people shouted with a great shout , the wall fell down flat . The people went into the city , every man straight ahead . They captured the city .
They utterly destroyed all that was in the city , both man and woman , young and old , and ox , and sheep , and ass , with the edge of the sword .
Joshua said to the two men that had spied out the country : » Go into the harlot’s house , and bring the woman out as you swore to her . «
The young men who were spies went in , and brought out Rahab , and her father , mother , and her brothers and all that she had . They brought out all her relatives and left them outside the camp of Israel .
They burned the city and all its contents . They put the silver , gold , and the vessels of brass and of iron into the treasury of the house of Jehovah .
Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive , and her father’s household , and all that she had . She dwells in Israel even to this day because she hid the messengers Joshua sent to spy out Jericho .
Joshua pronounced an oath at that time , saying : » Cursed be the man before Jehovah , that rises up and builds this city Jericho . He will lay the foundation at the cost of his firstborn . He will set up the gates at the cost of his youngest son . «
Jehovah was with Joshua and his fame spread throughout all the country .
The children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted things : for Achan , the son of Carmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zerah , of the tribe of Judah , took of the accursed thing : and the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the children of Israel .
Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai , which is beside Beth-aven , on the east side of Bethel . He spoke to them : » Go up and spy on the country . « And the men went up and spied on Ai .
They returned to Joshua , and said : » Do not send all the people . Send about two or three thousand men to Ai to go up and capture Ai . Do not bother all the people for there are only a few there . «
So about three thousand men left the people . The men of Ai routed them .
The men of Ai killed about thirty-six of them : for they chased them going down from before the gate to Shebarim . The heart of the people melted , and became as water . The Israelites lost their courage and were afraid
And Joshua ripped his clothes , and fell to the earth upon his face before the Ark of Jehovah until evening . He threw dust on his head . The elders of Israel did the same .
Joshua said : » Alas , Sovereign Lord Jehovah , why did you bring this people across the Jordan . Was it to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites , to destroy us ? Would to God we had been content to dwell on the other side of the Jordan !
» O Jehovah , what shall I say , when Israel turned their backs before its enemies !
» For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear about it , and will surround us and cut our name off from the earth . What will you do for your great name ? «
Jehovah said to Joshua : » You get up ! Why are you on your face ?
» Israel has sinned , and they have also transgressed my covenant I commanded them to keep . They have taken some of the devoted things and put them in their own possessions .
» Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies . They ran from their enemies , because they were accursed . I will not be with you any more until you destroy the devoted things you have among you .
» Get up and sanctify the people . Say : ‘ Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow : for the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says : » There is an accursed thing in the midst of you , O Israel : You cannot stand before you enemies until you take away the devoted thing from among you . «
» ‘ » In the morning assemble by tribe . The tribe Jehovah picks will come forward family by family and man by man .
» ‘ » He that has take the devoted things shall be burned in the fire , along with all that he owns . He has transgressed the covenant of Jehovah . He has committed a disgraceful thing in Israel . « ’ «
So Joshua rose up early in the morning , and brought Israel by their tribes ; and the tribe of Judah was taken :
He brought the family of Judah ; and he took the family of the Zarhites : and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man ; and Zabdi was taken :
And he brought his household man by man ; and Achan , the son of Carmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zerah , of the tribe of Judah , was taken .
Joshua said to Achan : » My son , give glory to Jehovah God of Israel and confess to him . Tell me now what you have done . Do not hide it from me . «
Achan answered Joshua : » Indeed I have sinned against Jehovah the God of Israel . This I have done .
» When I saw among the spoils a quality Babylonish garment , and two hundred shekels of silver , and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight , then I coveted them , and took them . I hid them in the earth in the middle of my tent . «
So Joshua sent messengers to the tent and found it and the silver .
They took them out of the middle of the tent , and brought them to Joshua , and to all the children of Israel , and laid them out before Jehovah .
And Joshua , and all Israel with him , took Achan the son of Zerah , and the silver , and the garment , and the wedge of gold , and his sons , and his daughters , and his oxen , and his asses , and his sheep , and his tent , and all that he had : and they brought them unto the valley of Achor .
Joshua said : » Why have you troubled us ? Jehovah will trouble you this day . « All Israel stoned them with stones . After they stoned them they burned them with fire .
They raised over them a great heap of stones that is there to this day . So Jehovah turned from the fierceness of his anger . The name of that place was called , the Valley of Achor , to this day .
Jehovah said to Joshua : » Do not fear and do not be discouraged troubled confused . Take all the people of war with you and go up to Ai . I have given into your hand the king of Ai , and his people , and his city , and his land .
» Do to Ai and her king what you did to Jericho and her king . Take the spoil and the cattle for yourselves . Lay an ambush for the city behind it . «
Joshua and all the people of war went up against Ai . Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valor , and sent them away by night .
He commanded them , saying : » You shall lie in wait against the city , even behind the city . Do not go very far from the city and be ready .
» I , and all the people that are with me , will approach the city . When they come out against us we will run away from them .
» They will come out after us till we have drawn them from the city . They will say : ‘ They run from us . ’ ’ Therefore we will run before them .
» Then you shall rise up from the ambush , and seize the city : for Jehovah your God will deliver it into your hand .
» When you have taken the city you will set the city on fire according to the commandment of Jehovah . See , I have commanded you . «
Joshua sent them forth . They went to lie in ambush , and stay between Bethel and Ai , on the west side of Ai . Joshua lodged that night among the people .
Joshua rose up early in the morning and mustered his men . He and the elders of Israel went in front of the people to Ai .
And all the people , even the people of war that were with him went to the city . They set up camp on the north side of Ai . There was a valley between them and Ai .
He took about five thousand men , and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai , on the west side of the city .
They had the solders take up their positions those in camp to the north and the ambush to the west . Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley .
When the king of Ai saw it , that they hasted and rose up early , and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle , he and all his people , at a time appointed headed for the plain . He did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city .
Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten in front of them and ran away to the wilderness .
All the people in Ai were called together to chase after them . They chased after Joshua , and were drawn away from the city .
There was no man left in Ai or Bethel . They all went after Israel : and they left the city open .
Jehovah said to Joshua : » Stretch out the spear javelin that is in your hand toward Ai . « I will give it to your hand . Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city .
The ambush began quickly . They ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand . They entered into the city , captured it and quickly set the city on fire .
The men of Ai looked behind and saw the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven . They had no power to run this way or that way : and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers .
When Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city , and that the smoke of the city ascended they turned and killed the men of Ai .
The men of the ambush came out of the city against them . They were caught in the middle with Israel on both sides . Israel killed them all . No one remained or escaped .
They captured the king of Ai alive , and brought him to Joshua .
When Israel finished slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field , in the wilderness where they chased them , and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword , until they were consumed , that all the Israelites returned to Ai , and killed it with the edge of the sword .
Twelve thousand men and women of Ai were killed that day .
Joshua did not withdraw his hand . He stretched out the spear , until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai .
Israel took the cattle and the spoil of that city for preys for themselves , according to the word Jehovah commanded Joshua .
Joshua burnt Ai and made it a heap forever , even desolation to this day .
He hung the king of Ai on a tree until evening . As soon as the sun was down , Joshua commanded that they take his carcass down from the tree and throw it at the entering gate of the city . They raised a large pile of rocks over it that is there to this day .
Then Joshua built an altar to Jehovah the God of Israel on mount Ebal ,
As Moses the servant of the Lord commanded the children of Israel , as it is written in the book of the Law of Moses , an altar of whole stones that have not been cut by any iron tool . They offered offerings to Jehovah , and sacrificed peace offerings .
He wrote upon the stones a copy of the Law of Moses . He did this in the presence of the children of Israel .
All Israel , and their elders , and officers , and their judges , stood on both sides of the Ark before the priests . The Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of Jehovah , as well the stranger , as he that was born among them ; Half of the people stood on Mount Gerizim . And half of them stood on Mount Ebal . As Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded before , that they should bless the people of Israel .
Afterward he read all the words of the Law , the blessings and cursing , according to all that is written in the Book of the Law .
There was not a word of all that Moses commanded that Joshua did not read before all the congregation of Israel , with the women , and the little ones , and the strangers that were conversant among them .
All the kings west of Jordan heard these things ; the kings in the hills , and in the valleys , in all the coasts of the Great Mediterraean Sea over against Lebanon , the Hittite , and the Amorite , the Canaanite , the Perizzite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite heard these things .
They gathered themselves together , to fight with Joshua and with Israel , with one accord unanimously one purpose .
When the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai ,
They resorted to a ruse scheme trick . They acted as if they had been ambassadors , and took old sacks upon their asses , and wine bottles , worn out , torn , and mended .
They had worn out and patched shoes on their feet , they wore old garments ; and all the bread of their provision was dry and moldy .
They went to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal , and said to him and to the men of Israel : » We come from a distant country , make a treaty with us . «
The men of Israel said to the Hivites : » Perhaps you live near us . How can we make a treaty with you ? «
They said : » We are your servants . « Joshua said to them : » Who are you ? Where do you come from ? «
They said : » From a very far country , your servants came because of the name of Jehovah your God , for we have heard about him and all he did in Egypt ;
» and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites , that were beyond Jordan , to Sihon king of Heshbon , and to Og king of Bashan , which was at Ashtaroth .
» Our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us , saying : ‘ Take provisions with you for the journey , and go to meet them , and say to them : » We are your servants . Therefore make a treaty with us . « ’ «
» We took hot fresh bread for our provision out of our houses on the day we came to you . Now it is dry , and it is moldy :
» These bottles of wine , which we filled , were new and now they are cracked . Our garments and shoes have become old by reason of the very long journey . «
The men sampled their provisions but did not ask for counsel from Jehovah .
Joshua made a treaty of peace with them to let them live . The leaders of the congregation ratified it by an oath .
At the end of three days after they had made a treaty with them , they heard that they were their neighbors , and that they lived among them .
The children of Israel journeyed to their cities on the third day . Their cities were Gibeon , and Chephirah , and Beeroth , and Kirjath-jearim .
The children of Israel did not kill them , because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by Jehovah God of Israel . The entire congregation murmured against the princes .
But all the leaders said to the entire congregation : » We have sworn to them by Jehovah the God of Israel : now therefore we may not touch them .
» This we will do to them . We will even let them live in case we become angry . This is because of the oath we swore to them . «
The leaders said to them : » Let them live ; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water to the entire congregation as the leaders had promised them .
Joshua called for them , and he spoke to them , saying : » Why did you deceive us , saying : ‘ We are very far from you ’ ’ when you dwell among us ?
Now you are cursed , and none of you will be freed from being slaves , and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God . «
They answered Joshua : » For the reason that it was absolutely told to your servants , how Jehovah your God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land , and destroy all the inhabitants of the land . Therefore we were very afraid for our lives because of you . So we did this thing .
» Now we are in your hands . Do to us what seems good and right to you . «
Joshua saved them from the children of Israel . They did not kill them .
Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation , and for the altar of Jehovah , even to this day , in the place he should choose .
When Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had taken Ai , and had utterly destroyed it ; as he had done to Jericho and her king , so he had done to Ai and her king . The inhabitants of Gibeon made peace with Israel and were living near them .
They were very afraid because Gibeon was a great royal city . It was larger than Ai and all the men there were great fighters .
Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron , and to Piram king of Jarmuth , and to Japhia king of Lachish , and to Debir king of Eglon , saying :
» Come to me and help me , that we may strike Gibeon : for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel . «
Therefore the five kings of the Amorites , the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , and the king of Eglon gathered together . They and all their hosts came before Gibeon and camped . Then they made war against it .
The men of Gibeon sent word to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal saying : Do not abandon your servants . Come to us quickly and save us . Help us for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains have gathered together against us .
So Joshua and all the people of war , the mighty warriors , ascended from Gilgal .
Jehovah said to Joshua : » Do not fear them . I have delivered them into your hands . Not one man of them will stand before you . «
Joshua came against them suddenly by surprise at night .
Jehovah threw them into confusion before Israel . They were killed in a great battle at Gibeon . They were chased along the road that goes up to Beth-horon . They were slaughtered all the way to Azekah , and Makkedah .
As they fled from Israel , and were going down to Beth-horon , Jehovah cast down great stones from heaven upon them all the way to Azekah and they died . In fact hailstones killed more than the children of Israel killed using their swords .
Joshua spoke to Jehovah the day when Jehovah delivered the Amorites to the children of Israel . He said in sight of Israel : » Sun , stand still upon Gibeon ; and Moon , stand still in the valley of Ajalon . «
The sun stood still , and the moon stood still , until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies . Is this not written in the book of Jasher ? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven , and did not go down for a whole day .
There was no day like that before or after it , that Jehovah listened to the voice of a man : for Jehovah fought for Israel .
All Israel returned with Joshua to the camp at Gilgal .
These five kings ran away and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah .
Joshua was told : » The five kings are found hidden in a cave at Makkedah . «
Joshua said : » Roll large stones in front of the mouth of the cave , and set men by it to guard them .
» Do not stay there but pursue after your enemies and strike the rear guard . Do not enter their cities for Jehovah your God has delivered them into your hand . «
When Joshua and the children of Israel finished slaying them those who escaped entered the fortified cities .
All the people returned in peace to Joshua’s at Makkedah . No one spoke against any of the children of Israel .
Then Joshua said : » Open the mouth of the cave , and bring out those five kings to me . «
They did so , and brought the five kings to him : the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , and the king of Eglon .
When they brought out the kings to Joshua , Joshua called for all the men of Israel , and said to the captains of the men of war who went with him : » Come near , put your feet on the back of the necks of humiliate abase these kings . « They came near , and put their feet upon their necks .
Joshua said : » Do not be afraid . Do not be terrified ! Be strong and have courage : for this is what Jehovah will do to all your enemies against whom you fight . «
Afterward Joshua struck and killed them . He hanged them on five trees : and they hung on the trees until evening .
At sunset Joshua commanded that they remove them . They took them down from the trees , and cast them into the cave where they had been hidden . They laid large stones in the mouth of the cave . Even today the stones are there .
That day Joshua struck Makkedah with the edge of the sword . The king was destroyed all the people who lived there . He let none remain : and he did to the king of Makkedah the same as he did to the king of Jericho .
Then Joshua passed from Makkedah , and all Israel went with him , to Libnah , and fought against Libnah :
Jehovah delivered it and the king into the hand of Israel . He struck it with the edge of the sword , and all the persons who lived there . He let none remain : and he did to the king of Libnah as he did to the king of Jericho .
Joshua passed from Libnah , and all Israel with him , to Lachish , and encamped against it , and fought against it :
Jehovah delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel on the second day . He struck it with the edge of the sword , and all the persons who lived there according to all that he had done to Libnah .
Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish . Joshua killed him and his people , until he had left none remaining .
From Lachish Joshua went to Eglon , and all Israel with him . They encamped against it , and fought against it :
They took it on that day and struck it with the edge of the sword . All that were there were destroyed that day , according to all that he had done to Lachish .
Joshua and all Israel with him went from Eglon to Hebron ; and they fought against it :
They capture it and destroyed it with the edge of the sword . This included the king and all the cities , and all the people who were there . He left none remaining , according to all that he had done to Eglon ; but destroyed it utterly , and destroyed all the people there .
Joshua and all Israel returned with him to Debir and fought against it :
He took it , and the king and all the cities there . They killed them with the edge of the sword , and utterly destroyed all people there . He left none remaining : as he had done to Hebron , so he did to Debir , and to the king as he had done also to Libnah , and to her king .
So Joshua struck all the country of the hills , and of the south , and of the vale , and of the springs , and all their kings : he left none remaining , but utterly destroyed all that breathed , as Jehovah God of Israel commanded .
And Joshua conquered them from Kadesh-barnea even to Gaza , and all the country of Goshen , even unto Gibeon .
All these kings and their land Joshua took at one time , because Jehovah the God of Israel fought for Israel .
Joshua returned , and all Israel returned with him to the camp at Gilgal .
Jabin king of Hazor heard about this . So he sent a message to Jobab king of Madon , and to the king of Shimron , and to the king of Achshaph ,
and to the kings north of the mountains , and of the plains south of Chinneroth , and in the valley , and in the borders of Dor on the west ,
and to the Canaanite on the east and on the west , and to the Amorite , and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , and the Jebusite in the mountains , and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh .
They came out with all their troops and many horses and chariots . Their army was more numerous than the sand of the seashore .
All the kings met at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel .
Jehovah said to Joshua : » Do not be afraid because of them ! About this time tomorrow I will deliver them up all slain before Israel . You must hamstring their horses , and burn their chariots with fire . «
So Joshua and all the people of war with him came up against them . Suddenly they attacked them by the waters of Merom .
Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Israel , who killed them . They chased them unto great Zidon , and to Misrephoth-maim , and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward ; and they killed them . They did not leave any survivor remain .
Joshua did to them what Jehovah told him to do . He hamstrung their horses , and burned their chariots with fire .
Joshua then turned back , and captured Hazor . He killed the king with the sword , for Hazor formerly was the head of all these kingdoms .
They killed all the people there with the edge of the sword . He utterly destroyed them . None were left alive . He burned Hazor with fire .
Joshua took all the cities and all the kings and struck them with the edge of the sword . He utterly destroyed them . Just as Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded .
Israel did not burn the cities that stood on their own mounds with the exception of Hazor , which Joshua burned .
Israel took all the spoil of these cities including the cattle . They killed every man with the edge of the sword , until they had destroyed them all . None were left alive .
Jehovah commanded Moses his servant and so Moses commands Joshua and Joshua complied . He left nothing undone of all that Jehovah commanded Moses .
Joshua took all that land , the hills , and all the south country , and all the land of Goshen , and the valley , and the plain , and the mountain of Israel , and the valley of the same .
Even from Mount Halak , that goes up to Seir , even unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon . He captured and killed all their kings .
Joshua waged war a long time with all these kings .
Not one city made peace with the children of Israel except the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon . They took all the others in battle .
It was Jehovah who hardened their hearts to make war against Israel . That way he could completely destroy them . That they might have no favor , but that he might destroy them , as Jehovah commanded Moses .
Joshua cut off the Anakims from the mountains , from Hebron , from Debir , from Anab , and from all the mountains of Judah , and from all the mountains of Israel . Joshua destroyed them utterly along with their cities .
There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel . Some of them remained in Gaza , in Gath , and in Ashdod .
So Joshua took the whole land , according to all that Jehovah said to Moses . Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions , by their tribes . The land rested from war .
These are the kings of the land that the children of Israel defeated and who’s territory they captured . It was on the other side of Jordan toward the rising of the sun , from the Arnon River to Mount Hermon , and all the plain on the east .
Sihon king of the Amorites , who lived in Heshbon , and ruled from Aroer , which is upon the bank of the Arnon River , and from the middle of the river , and from half Gilead , to the Jabbok River , which is the border of the children of Ammon ;
And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east , and to the sea of the plain , even the salt sea on the east , the way to Beth-jeshimoth ; and from the south , under Ashdoth-pisgah :
The coast of Og king of Bashan , which was of the remnant of the giants , that lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei ,
And reigned in Mount Hermon , and in Salcah , and in all Bashan , to the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites , and half Gilead , the border of Sihon king of Heshbon .
Moses the servant of Jehovah and the children of Israel killed them . Moses the servant of Jehovah gave it for a possession to the Reubenites , and the Gadites , and the half tribe of Manasseh .
These are the kings of the country that Joshua and the children of Israel conquered on this side of the Jordan on the west , from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon even to Mount Halak , that goes up to Seir ; which Joshua gave to the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions ;
In the mountains , and in the valleys , and in the plains , and in the springs , and in the wilderness , and in the south country the Hittites , the Amorites , and the Canaanites , the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites :
The king of Jericho , one ; the king of Ai , which is beside Bethel , one ;
The king of Jerusalem , one ; the king of Hebron , one ;
The king of Jarmuth , one ; the king of Lachish , one ;
The king of Eglon , one ; the king of Gezer , one ;

The king of Kedesh , one ; the king of Jokneam of Carmel , one ;
The king of Dor in the coast of Dor , one ; the king of the nations of Gilgal , one ;
The king of Tirzah , one : all the kings being thirty-one .
Jehovah said to Joshua : You are old and advanced in years . There still remains much land to be possessed .
This is the land that yet remains : » All the borders of the Philistines , and all Geshuri ,
» from Shihor , which is near Egypt , to the borders of Ekron northward , which is counted to the Canaanite : five lords of the Philistines ; the Gazathites , and the Ashdothites , the Eshkalonites , the Gittites , and the Ekronites ; also the Avites :
» from the south , all the land of the Canaanites , and Mearah that is beside the Sidonians , to Aphek , to the borders of the Amorites :
» The land of the Giblites , and all Lebanon , to the east , from Baal-gad under mount Hermon to the Hamath border .
» All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim , and all the Sidonians . I will drive them out from before the children of Israel . Divide it by lot to the Israelites for an inheritance , as I have commanded you .
» Divide this land for an inheritance among the nine tribes , and the half tribe of Manasseh . «
With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance , which Moses gave them , beyond Jordan eastward , even as Moses the servant of Jehovah gave them .
From Aroer , that is upon the bank of the river Arnon , and the city that is in the midst of the river , and all the plain of Medeba to Dibon
All the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites , who reigned in Heshbon , to the border of the children of Ammon ;
And Gilead , and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites , and all mount Hermon , and all Bashan to Salcah ;
The kingdom of Og in Bashan , which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei , who remained of the remnant of the giants . Moses defeated them and took over their land .
Nevertheless the children of Israel did not expel the Geshurites , or the Maachathites : but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day .
He gave no inheritance to the tribe of Levi . The sacrifices of Jehovah God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance , as he said to them .
Moses gave to the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance according to their families .
Their coast was from Aroer that is on the bank of the river Arnon , and the city that is in the midst of the river , and all the plain by Medeba ,
Heshbon , and all her cities that are in the plain ; Dibon , and Bamoth-baal , and Beth-baal-meon ,
And Jahazah , and Kedemoth , and Mephaath ,
And Kirjathaim , and Sibmah , and Zareth-shahar in the mount of the valley ,
And Beth-peor , and Ashdoth-pisgah , and Beth-jeshimoth ,
All the cities of the plain , and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites , who reigned in Heshbon , whom Moses killed with the princes of Midian , Evi , and Rekem , and Zur , and Hur , and Reba , who were dukes of Sihon , living in the country .
Balaam was also the son of Beor , the soothsayer . The children of Israel slayed him along with all who were slain with the sword .
The border of the children of Reuben was Jordan and its border . This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families , the cities and the villages there .
Moses gave inheritance to the tribe of Gad according to their families .
Their coast was Jazer , and all the cities of Gilead , and half the land of the children of Ammon , to Aroer that is near Rabbah ;
From Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh , and Betonim ; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir ;
In the valley , Beth-aram , and Beth-nimrah , and Succoth , and Zaphon , the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon , Jordan and his border , to the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward .
This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families , the cities , and their villages .
Moses gave inheritance to the half tribe of Manasseh . This was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by families .
Their coast was from Mahanaim , all Bashan , all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan , and all the towns of Jair , which are in Bashan , sixty cities :
Half Gilead , and Ashtaroth , and Edrei , cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan , were pertaining unto the children of Machir the son of Manasseh , even to the one half of the children of Machir by their families .
These are the countries that Moses distributed for inheritance in the plains of Moab , on the other side Jordan , by Jericho , eastward .
But he gave no inheritance to the tribe of Levi . Jehovah God of Israel was their inheritance , as he said to them .
These are the countries that the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan , which Eleazar the priest , and Joshua the son of Nun , and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel , distributed for their inheritance .
Their inheritance was by lot . Jehovah commanded the hand of Moses to distribute to the nine tribes and the half tribe .
Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and a half tribe on the other side of the Jordan . He gave no inheritance to the Levites .
The children of Joseph were two tribes , Manasseh and Ephraim . No part of the land was given to the Levites . They were given cities in which to live and a place for their cattle and personally property .
The people of Israel did as Jehovah commanded Moses . They divided the land .
Then the children of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal : and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said to him : » You know what Jehovah said to Moses the man of God concerning you and me in Kadesh-barnea .
» I was forty years old when Moses the servant of Jehovah sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land . I brought him word again as it was in my heart .
» Nevertheless my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people dissolve . But I wholly followed Jehovah my God .
» Moses swore on that day , saying : ‘ Surely the land where your feet have trodden shall be your inheritance , and your children’s from generation to generation , because you have completely followed Jehovah my God .
» ‘ Jehovah has kept me alive , as he said , these forty-five years , even since Jehovah spoke this word to Moses , while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness . Now I am this day eighty-five years old .
» ‘ So far I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me : as my strength was then , even so is my strength is now , for war , both to go out , and to come in .
» ‘ Now therefore give me this mountain . This is where Jehovah spoke that day . You heard about the Anakims that day . Their cities were large and fortified and Jehovah helped me drive them out just as Jehovah said . «
Joshua blessed Caleb the son of Jephunneh and gave him Hebron for an inheritance .
Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite to this day , because that he wholly followed Jehovah the God of Israel .
Hebron was previously named Kirjath-arba . Arba was a great man among the Anakims . The land and its people had rest from war .
This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families : The border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward was the farthest part of the south coast .
The shore of the salt sea was their south border , from the bay that looks southward :
From there it went out to the south side to Maaleh-acrabbim , and passed along to Zin , and ascended up on the south side to Kadesh-barnea , and passed along to Hezron , and went up to Adar , and went around to Karka :
From there it passed toward Azmon and went out to the river of Egypt and ended at the south coast at the sea .
The east border was the salt sea to the end of Jordan . Their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan :
Their border continued to Beth-hogla , and passed along by the north of Beth-arabah . The border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben :
The border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor , and so northward , looking toward Gilgal , that is before the going up to Adummim , which is on the south side of the river . Then the border passed toward the waters of En-shemesh and came out at En-rogel :
The border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom to the south side of the Jebusite ; the same is Jerusalem : and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the Valley of Hinnom westward , which is at the end of the Valley of the Giants northward :
Then the border was drawn from the top of the hill to the fountain of the water of Nephtoah , and went out to the cities of Mount Ephron ; and the border was drawn to Baalah , which is Kirjath-jearim :
The border circled Baalah westward to Mount Seir , and passed along to the side of mount Jearim , which is Chesalon , on the north side , and went down to Beth-shemesh , and passed on to Timnah :
And the border went out to the north side of Ekron : and the border was drawn to Shicron , and passed along to Mount Baalah , and went out to Jabneel to the sea .
The west border was to the coast of the great sea . This is the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their families .
To Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah , according to the commandment of Jehovah to Joshua , even the city of Arba the father of Anak , which city is Hebron .
From Hebron Caleb drove out the three sons of Anak , Sheshai , and Ahiman , and Talmai .
He went to the inhabitants of Debir . The name of Debir previously was Kirjath-sepher .
Caleb said : » I will give Achsah my daughter in marriage to the man who captures it and kills Kirjath-sepher . «
Othniel the son of Kenaz , the brother of Caleb , took it : and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife .
She came to him and convinced him to ask of her father for a field . She dismounted her donkey and Caleb said to her : » What do you wish ? «
She answered : » Give me a blessing . For you have given me a land in the south which includes springs of water . « He gave her the upper springs , and the lower springs .
This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families .
The cities at the limits of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the border of Edom southward were Kabzeel , and Eder , and Jagur ,

Keilah , and Achzib , and Mareshah ; nine cities with their villages :
Ekron , with her towns and her villages :
From Ekron even to the sea , all that lay near Ashdod , with their villages :
Ashdod with her towns and her villages , Gaza with her towns and her villages , to the river of Egypt , and the great sea , and the border there .
In the mountains , Shamir , and Jattir , and Socoh ,
Dannah , and Kirjath-sannah , which is Debir ,

Goshen , and Holon , and Giloh ; eleven cities with their villages :

In the wilderness , Beth-arabah , Middin , and Secacah ,
Nibshan , and the city of Salt , and En-gedi ; six cities with their villages .
As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem , the children of Judah could not drive them out . The Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to this day .
The lot was for the children of Joseph . It fell from the Jordan by Jericho , to the water of Jericho on the east , to the wilderness that goes up from Jericho throughout mount Bethel .
It goes out from Bethel to Luz , and passes along to the borders of Archi to Ataroth ,
It goes down westward to the coast of Japhleti , to the coast of Beth-horon the nether , and to Gezer : ending at the sea .
So the children of Joseph , Manasseh and Ephraim , took their inheritance .
The border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was thus : even the border of their inheritance on the east side was Ataroth-addar , to Beth-horon the upper ;
The border went toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side ; and the border went about eastward to Taanath-shiloh , and passed by it on the east to Janohah ;
It went down from Janohah to Ataroth , and to Naarath , and came to Jericho , and went out at Jordan .
The border went out from Tappuah westward to the river Kanah ; and from there to the sea . This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families .
The separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh , all the cities with their villages .
They did not drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer : but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites to this day , and have become forced laborers .
There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh . He was the firstborn of Joseph . Machir was the firstborn of Manasseh , the father of Gilead : because he was a man of war , therefore he had Gilead and Bashan .
There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families . For the children of Abiezer , and for the children of Helek , and for the children of Asriel , and for the children of Shechem , and for the children of Hepher , and for the children of Shemida : these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families .
But Zelophehad , the son of Hepher , the son of Gilead , the son of Machir , the son of Manasseh , had no sons , but daughters : and these are the names of his daughters , Mahlah , and Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .
They came near before Eleazar the priest , and before Joshua the son of Nun , and before the princes , saying : » Jehovah commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers . « Therefore according to the commandment of Jehovah he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father .
Ten shares fell to Manasseh , beside the land of Gilead and Bashan , on the other side of Jordan
Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons : and the rest of Manasseh’s sons had the land of Gilead .
The coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah . It lies before Shechem ; and the border went along on the right hand to the inhabitants of En-tappuah .
Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah : but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim .
The coast descended to the river Kanah , southward of the river : these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh : the coast of Manasseh also was on the north side of the river , and it ended at the sea .
Southward it was Ephraim’s , and northward it was Manasseh’s , and the sea is his border ; and they met together in Asher on the north , and in Issachar on the east .
Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and her towns , and Ibleam and her towns , and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns , and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns , and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns , and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns , even three countries .
Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities ; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land .
When the children of Israel were very strong they subjected the Canaanites to forced labor . They did not completely drive them out .
The children of Joseph spoke to Joshua , saying : » Why have you given me but one lot and one portion to inherit , seeing I am a great people , forasmuch as Jehovah has blessed us abundantly . «
Joshua answered : » If you are a great people , then get to the wood country , and cut down for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants , if mount Ephraim is too narrow for you . «
The children of Joseph said : » The hill is not enough for us . All the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron , both they who are of Beth-shean and her towns , and they who are of the valley of Jezreel . «
Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph , even to Ephraim and to Manasseh , saying : » You are a great people . You have great power . You will not have only one lot .
» The mountain will be yours . For it is a wood , and you will cut it down . The farthest limits will be yours . You will drive out the Canaanites , though they have iron chariots , and though they are strong . «
The whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh . They set up the tabernacle of the congregation there . The land was subdued before them .
There remained among the children of Israel seven tribes that had not yet received their inheritance .
Joshua said to the children of Israel : » How long will you neglect to go to possess the land , which Jehovah the God of your fathers has given you ?
» Appoint three men from each tribe : and I will send them , and they will rise , and go through the land , and write a description of it according to their inheritance . Then they will return to me .
» They will divide it into seven parts : Judah will abide in their border on the south , and the house of Joseph will abide in their border on the north .
» You will write a description of the land divided into seven parts , and bring the description to me , that I may cast lots for you here before Jehovah our God .
» The Levites have no part among you . The priesthood of Jehovah is their inheritance . Gad , and Reuben , and half the tribe of Manasseh , have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east , which Moses the servant of the Jehovah gave them . «
The men stood up and went away . Joshua charged them that went to describe the land , saying : » Go and walk through the land , and write a description of it , and come again to me , that I may cast lots for you before Jehovah in Shiloh . «
The men went and passed through the land , and wrote a description of it by cities into seven parts in a book , and returned to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh .
Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before Jehovah . Then Joshua divided the land to the children of Israel according to their divisions .
The lot for the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families : and the boundary of their lot came between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph .
And their border on the north side was from Jordan ; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side , and went up through the mountains westward ; and it ended at the wilderness of Bethaven .
The border went from there to Luz , to the side of Luz , which is Bethel , southward ; and the border descended to Ataroth-adar , near the hill that lies on the south side of the nether Beth-horon .
From the hill that lies before Beth-horon southward ; and it ended at Kirjath-baal , which is Kirjath-jearim , a city of the children of Judah : this was the west quarter .

It passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward , and went down to Arabah :
The border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah northward : and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan : this was the south coast .
Jordan was the border of it on the east side . This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin , by the border according to their families .
Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho , and Beth-hoglah , and the valley of Keziz ,

And all the villages that were near these cities to Baalath-beer , Ramath of the south . This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families .
Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon : for the part of the children of Judah was too much for them : therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within their inheritance .
The third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families : and the border of their inheritance was to Sarid :
Their border went up toward the sea , and Maralah , and reached to Dabbasheth , and reached to the river that is before Jokneam .
It turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising to the border of Chisloth-tabor , and then goes out to Daberath , and goes up to Japhia ,
From there it passed on along on the east to Gittah-hepher , to Ittah-kazin , and goes out to Remmon-methoar to Neah .
And the border goes around it on the north side to Hannathon : and it ends in the valley of Jipthah-el :
Kattath , and Nahallal , and Shimron , and Idalah , and Bethlehem : twelve cities with their villages .

This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families , these cities with their villages .
When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by their boundaries , the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them :
According to the word of Jehovah they gave him the city that he requested , Timnathserah on mount Ephraim : and he built the city , and lived there .
These are the inheritances , which Eleazar the priest , and Joshua the son of Nun , and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel , divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before Jehovah , at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation . So they finished dividing the country .
Jehovah spoke to Joshua , saying :
Speak to the children of Israel and say : » Designate cities of refuge just as Moses directed .
» Anyone who kills someone accidentally and unintentionally may go there for a refuge from the avenger of blood .
» When you flee to one of these cities you must go to the place of judgment at the entrance to the city , and explain to the leaders what happened . Then they will let you into the city and give you a place to live in , so that you can stay there .
» If the one looking for revenge follows you there , the people of the city must not hand you over to that one . They must protect you because you killed the person accidentally and not out of anger .
» You may stay in the city until you have received a public trial and until the death of the man who is then the High Priest . Then you may go back home to your own town , from which you had run away . «
So , on the west side of the Jordan River they set aside Kedesh in Galilee , in the hill country of Naphtali , Shechem , in the hill country of Ephraim and Hebron , in the hill country of Judah .
East of the Jordan , on the desert plateau east of Jericho , they chose Bezer in the territory of Reuben ; Ramoth in Gilead , in the territory of Gad ; and Golan in Bashan , in the territory of Manasseh .
These were the cities of refuge chosen for all the people of Israel and for any foreigner living among them . Any who killed a person accidentally could find protection there from the one looking for revenge . They could not be killed unless they had first received a public trial .
The leaders of the Levite families went to Eleazar the priest , Joshua son of Nun , and to the heads of the families of all the tribes of Israel .
There at Shiloh in the land of Canaan they said to them : » Jehovah commanded through Moses that we were to be given cities to live in , as well as pasture land around them for our livestock . «
So in accordance with Jehovah’s command the people of Israel gave the Levites cities and pasturelands out of their own territories .
The families of the Levite clan of Kohath were the first to be assigned cities . The families who were descended from Aaron the priest were assigned thirteen cities from the territories of Judah , Simeon , and Benjamin .
The rest of the clan of Kohath was assigned ten cities from the territories of Ephraim , Dan , and West Manasseh .
The clan of Gershon was assigned thirteen cities from the territories of Issachar , Asher , Naphtali , and East Manasseh in Bashan .
The families of the clan of Merari were assigned twelve cities from the territories of Reuben , Gad , and Zebulun .
By drawing lots , the people of Israel assigned these cities and their pasturelands to the Levites , as Jehovah commanded through Moses .
These are the names of the cities from the territories of Judah and Simeon .
These were given to the descendants of Aaron who were of the clan of Kohath and who were descended from Levi . Their assignment was the first to be made .
They were given the city of Arba . Arba was Anak’s father . Arba is now called Hebron . It is in the hill country of Judah , along with the pastureland surrounding it .
The fields that were in the city and its towns had already been given to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his possession .
In addition to Hebron , one of the cities of refuge , the following cities were assigned to the descendants of Aaron the priest : Libnah ,
Jattir , Eshtemoa ,
Holon , Debir ,
Ain , Juttah , and Beth Shemesh , with their pasturelands : nine cities from the tribes of Judah and Simeon .
From the territory of Benjamin they were given four cities : Gibeon , Geba ,
Anathoth , and Almon , with their pasturelands .
Thirteen cities in all , with pasturelands , were given to the priests , the descendants of Aaron .
The other families of the Levite clan of Kohath were assigned some cities from the territory of Ephraim .
They were given four cities : Shechem and its pasture lands in the hill country of Ephraim , one of the cities of refuge , Gezer ,
Kibzaim , and Beth Horon , with their pasturelands .
From the territory of Dan they were given four cities : Eltekeh , Gibbethon ,
Aijalon , and Gathrimmon , with pasturelands .
From the territory of West Manasseh they were given two cities : Taanach and Gathrimmon , with pasturelands .
These families of the clan of Kohath received ten cities in all , with pasturelands .
Another group of Levites , the clan of Gershon , received from the territory of East Manasseh two cities : Golan in Bashan , one of the cities of refuge , and Beeshterah , with pasturelands .
From the territory of Issachar they received four cities : Kishion , Daberath ,
Jarmuth , and Engannim , with pasturelands .
From the territory of Asher they received four cities : Mishal , Abdon ,
Helkath , and Rehob , with pasturelands .
From the territory of Naphtali they received three cities : Kedesh in Galilee , with pasture lands , one of the cities of refuge , Hammoth-Dor , and Kartan , with pasturelands .
The families of the clan of Gershon received a total of thirteen cities with pasturelands .
The rest of the Levites , the clan of Merari , received from the territory of Zebulun four cities : Jokneam , Kartah ,
Dimnah , and Nahalal , with pasturelands .
From the territory of Reuben they received four cities : Bezer , Jahaz ,
Kedemoth , and Mephaath , with pasturelands .
From the tribe of Gad they received four cities : Ramoth in Gilead , with pasturelands , one of the cities of refuge , Mahanaim ,
Heshbon , and Jazer , with pasturelands .
The clan of Merari was assigned a total of twelve cities .
From the land that the people of Israel possessed , a total of forty-eight cities , with the pasturelands around them , was given to the Levites .
Each of these towns had pasturelands surrounding it .
Jehovah gave to Israel all the land that he had solemnly promised their ancestors he would give them . They took possession of it and settled down there .
Jehovah granted them peace throughout the land . This is just as he had promised their ancestors . Not one of all their enemies was able to stand against them , because Jehovah gave the Israelites the victory over all their enemies .
Jehovah kept every one of the promises he made to the people of Israel .
Joshua called together the people of the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and Manasseh .
He said : » You have done everything Jehovah’s servant Moses ordered you to do . You have obeyed all my commands .
» You have never deserted the other Israelites . You have been careful to obey the commandments of Jehovah your God .
» Jehovah your God has given the other Israelites peace as he promised . So go back home to the land you claimed for your own , the land on the east side of the Jordan , that Moses , Jehovah’s servant , gave you .
» Be sure you obey the Law that Moses commanded you . Love Jehovah your God . Do his will . Obey his commandments and be faithful to him . Serve him with all your heart and with all your being Nephesh : living being . «
Joshua blessed them and sent them on their way .
To the one half tribe of Manasseh Moses had given possession in Bashan : but he gave the other half to Joshua among their brothers on this side Jordan westward . Joshua sent them a way to their tents and he blessed them .
He said : » Return with much riches to your tents , and with very much cattle , with silver , and with gold , and with brass , and with iron , and with very much raiment : divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers . «
So the people of the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and Manasseh went back home . They left the rest of the people of Israel at Shiloh in the land of Canaan and started out for their own land , the land of Gilead , which they had taken as Jehovah commanded them through Moses .
The children of Reuben and Gad and the half tribe of Manassah built a large altar by the borders of Jordan in the land of Canaan .
The children of Israel heard that the half tribe of Manasseh built an altar in the land of Canaan on the side belonging to the sons of Israel , at the Jordan when they passed by .
When the people of Israel heard this , the whole community came together at Shiloh to go to war against the eastern tribes .
Then the people of Israel sent Phinehas , the son of Eleazar the priest , to the people of the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and East Manasseh in the land of Gilead .
Ten leading men went with Phinehas , one from each of the western tribes and each one the head of a family among the clans .
They came to the land of Gilead , to the people of Reuben , Gad , and East Manasseh ,
Speaking for the whole assembly of Jehovah’s people they said : » Why have you done this evil thing against the God of Israel ? You have rebelled against Jehovah by building this altar for yourselves ! You are no longer following him !
» Do you remember our sin at Peor , when Jehovah punished his own people with an epidemic ? We are still suffering because of that . Was that not enough sin ?
» Are you going to refuse to follow him now ? If you rebel against Jehovah now , he will be angry with everyone in Israel .
» If your land is not fit to worship in , come over into Jehovah’s land , where his Tabernacle is . Claim some land among us . But do not rebel against Jehovah or make rebels out of us by building an altar in addition to the altar of Jehovah our God .
» Remember how Achan son of Zerah would not obey the command about the things condemned to destruction . The whole assembly of Israel was punished for that . Achan was not the only one who died because of his sin .
» The people of the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and East Manasseh answered the heads of the families of the western tribes :
» The Mighty , Divine One is God of Gods ! He is Jehovah ! The Mighty , Divine One is God of Gods ! He is Jehovah ! He knows why we did this , and we want you to know too ! If we rebelled and did not keep faith with Jehovah , do not allow us to live any longer !
» If we disobeyed Jehovah and built our own altar to burn sacrifices on or to use for grain offerings or fellowship offerings , let Jehovah himself punish us .
» No ! We did it because we were afraid that in the future your descendants would say to ours : What do you have to do with Jehovah , the God of Israel ?
» He made the Jordan a boundary between the people of Reuben and Gad and us . You have nothing to do with Jehovah . Then your descendants might make our descendants stop worshiping Jehovah .
» We did not built an altar to burn sacrifices or make offerings ,
but instead , as a sign for our people and yours , and for the generations after us , that we do indeed worship Jehovah . We do this before his sacred Tabernacle with our offerings to be burned and with sacrifices and fellowship offerings . This was to keep your descendants from saying that ours have nothing to do with Jehovah . «
» We thought that if this should ever happen , our descendants could say : ‘ You see our ancestors made an altar just like Jehovah’s altar . It was not for burning offerings or for sacrifice , but as a sign for our people and yours . ’ «
We would certainly not rebel against Jehovah or stop following him now by building an altar to burn offerings on or for grain offerings or sacrifices . We would not build any other altar than the altar of Jehovah our God that stands in front of the Tabernacle of his presence .
Phinehas the priest and the ten leading men of the community with him , the heads of families of the western tribes , heard what the people of the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and East Manasseh had to say , and they were satisfied .
Phinehas , the son of Eleazar the priest , said to them : » We know that Jehovah is with us . You have not rebelled against him . So you have saved the people of Israel from Jehovah’s punishment . «
Phinehas and the leaders left the people of Reuben and Gad in the land of Gilead and went back to Canaan , to the people of Israel , and reported to them .
The Israelites were satisfied and praised God . They no longer talked about going to war to devastate the land where the people of Reuben and Gad had settled .
The people of Reuben and Gad said : » This altar is a witness to all of us that Jehovah is God . Therefore they named it witness . «
Later Jehovah gave Israel security from their enemies all around . By that time Joshua was very old .
He called all Israel , the elders , leaders , judges , and officers of the people , and said : » I am very old now .
» You have seen everything Jehovah your God has done to all these nations because of you . Jehovah your God fights for you .
» I have assigned as the possession of your tribes the land of the nations that are still left , as well as of all the nations that I have already conquered , from the Jordan River in the east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west .
» Jehovah your God will make them retreat from you . He will drive them away as you advance . You will possess their land , as Jehovah your God promised you .
» Be careful to obey and do everything that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses . Do not neglect any of it .
» You will not associate with these peoples left among you or speak the names of their gods or use those names in taking vows or worship those gods or bow down to them .
» Remain faithful to Jehovah , as you have been until now .
» Jehovah has driven great and powerful nations from before you . No one has ever been able to stand against you .
» One of you can make a thousand men run away , because Jehovah your God is fighting for you , as he promised .
» Take heed of yourselves to love Jehovah your God .
» If you are disloyal and join with the nations that are still left among you and intermarry with them ,
» Jehovah your God will no longer drive these nations out as you advance . Rather , they will be as dangerous for you as a trap or a pit and as painful as a whip on your back or thorns in your eyes . This will last until none of you are left in this good land that Jehovah your God gave you .
» It is time for me to die . Every one of you knows in his heart and very being that Jehovah your God has given you all the good things he promised . Every promise he made has been kept ; not one has failed .
» Just as he kept every promise that he made to you , so he will carry out every threat .
» If you do not obey the covenant Jehovah your God commanded you to obey and if you serve and worship other gods , then in his anger he will punish you . Soon none of you will be left in this good land that he gave you . «
Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel together at Shechem . He called the elders , the leaders , the judges , and the officers of Israel , and they came to the presence of God .
Joshua said to all the people : » This is what Jehovah , the God of Israel says : ‘ Long ago your ancestors lived on the other side of the Euphrates River and worshiped other gods . One of those ancestors was Terah , the father of Abraham and Nahor .
» ‘ I took Abraham , your ancestor , from the land across the Euphrates and led him through the whole land of Canaan . I gave him many descendants . I gave him Isaac ,
and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau . I gave Esau the hill country of Edom as his possession , but your ancestor Jacob and his children went down to Egypt .
» ‘ Later I sent Moses and Aaron , and I brought great trouble on Egypt . I led you out .
» ‘ I brought your ancestors out of Egypt , and the Egyptians pursued them with chariots and cavalry . When your ancestors got to the Red Sea
they cried out to me for help . I put darkness between them and the Egyptians . I made the sea come rolling over the Egyptians and drown them . You know what I did to Egypt . You lived in the desert a long time .
» ‘ I brought you to the land of the Amorites , who lived on the east side of the Jordan . They fought you , but I gave you victory over them . You took their land . I destroyed them as you advanced .
» ‘ The king of Moab , Balak son of Zippor , fought against you . He sent word to Balaam son of Beor and asked him to put a curse on you .
» ‘ But I would not listen to Balaam , so he blessed you , and in this way I rescued you from Balak .
» ‘ You crossed the Jordan and traveled to Jericho . The men of Jericho fought you , as did the Amorites , the Perizzites , the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Girgashites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites . I gave you victory over all of them .
» ‘ You advanced and I threw them into panic in order to drive out the two Amorite kings . Your swords and bows had nothing to do with it .
» ‘ I gave you a land that you had never worked and cities that you had not built . Now live there and eat grapes from vines that you did not plant , and olives from trees that you did not plant .
» ‘ Honor Jehovah and serve him sincerely and in truth . Get rid of the gods that your ancestors used to worship in Mesopotamia and in Egypt , and serve only Jehovah .
» ‘ If you are not willing to serve him , decide today whom you will serve , the gods your ancestors worshiped in Mesopotamia or the gods of the Amorites , in whose land you are now living . As for my family and me , we will serve Jehovah . ’ «
The people replied : » We would never leave Jehovah to serve other gods !
» Jehovah our God brought our fathers and us out of slavery in Egypt . We saw the miracles he performed . He kept us safe wherever we went among all the nations through which we passed .
» As we advanced to this land , Jehovah drove out all the Amorites who lived here . We also will serve Jehovah . He is our God ! «
Joshua said to the people : » You may not be able to serve Jehovah . He is a holy God and will not forgive your sins . He will tolerate no rivals ,
and if you leave him to serve foreign gods , he will turn against you and punish you . He will destroy you , even though he was good to you before . «
The people said to Joshua : » No ! We will serve Jehovah ! «
Joshua replied : » You are your own witnesses to the fact that you have chosen to serve Jehovah . « They said : » We are witnesses ! «
» Remove the foreign gods you have . « He demanded : » Pledge your loyalty to Jehovah , the God of Israel . «
The people said to Joshua : » We will serve Jehovah our God . We will obey his commands . «
Joshua made a covenant for the people that day at Shechem . He gave them laws and rules to follow .
Joshua wrote these commands in the Book of the Law of God . Then he took a large stone and set it up under the oak tree in Jehovah’s sanctuary .
He told the people : » This stone will serve as our witness . It has heard all the words that Jehovah spoke to us . So it will be a witness against you , to keep you from rebelling against your God . «
Joshua sent the people away , and everyone returned to their own part of the land .
After that , Jehovah’s servant Joshua son of Nun died at the age of a hundred and ten .
They buried him on his own land at Timnath Serah in the hill country of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash .
As long as Joshua lived , the people of Israel served Jehovah . After his death they continued to do so as long as those leaders were alive who had seen for themselves everything Jehovah had done for Israel .
The body of Joseph , which the people of Israel had brought from Egypt , was buried at Shechem , in the piece of land that Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor , the father of Shechem , for a hundred pieces of silver . Joseph’s descendants inherited this land .
Eleazar son of Aaron died and was buried at Gibeah , the town in the hill country of Ephraim that had been given to his son Phinehas .
After the death of Joshua , the children of Israel asked Jehovah , saying : » Who will go first to fight against the Canaanites for us ? «
Jehovah said : » Judah will go up . I have delivered the land into his hand . «
Judah said to Simeon his brother : » Come up with me to my allotted territory that we may fight against the Canaanites . I likewise will go with you to your territory . « So Simeon went with him .
Judah went up and Jehovah delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand . They killed ten thousand men at Bezek .
They found Adoni-bezek in Bezek : and they fought against him . They killed the Canaanites and the Perizzites .
Adoni-bezek fled and they chased him , caught him , and cut off his thumbs and his big toes .
And Adoni-bezek said : » Seventy kings with their big toes cut off have gathered food scrapes under my table . God has repaid me for what I have done . « So they brought him to Jerusalem where he died .
The children of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it . They put it to the sword and set the city on fire .
Afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites , that lived in the mountain , and in the south , and in the valley .
Judah went against the Canaanites that lived in Hebron previously called Kirjath-arba and they slew Sheshai , and Ahiman , and Talmai .
From there they advanced against the inhabitants of Debir : and the name of Debir before was Kirjath-sepher :
Caleb said : » He that attacks Kirjath-sepher , and captures it , to him will I give Achsah my daughter for a wife . «
Othniel the son of Kenaz , Caleb’s younger brother , took it : and he gave him Achsah his daughter for a wife .
When she came to him she persuaded him to ask her father for a field . When she got off her donkey Caleb said to her : » What do you wish ? «
She said : » Give me a blessing : for you have given me a land south with spring water . « And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs .
The children of the Kenite , Moses’ father-in-law , went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah to the wilderness of Judah , which lies in the south of Arad to live with the people .
And Judah went with Simeon his brother , and they attacked the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath and utterly destroyed it . The name of the city was Hormah .
Judah took Gaza with its territory , and Ashkelon with its territory as well as Ekron with its territory .
Jehovah was with Judah . He drove out the inhabitants of the mountain ; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley , because they had chariots of iron .
They gave Hebron to Caleb , as Moses had promised and he expelled the three sons of Anak .
The children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem . The Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day .
The house of Joseph also attacked Bethel : and Jehovah was with them .
The house of Joseph sent men to spy out Bethel .
The spies saw a man come forth out of the city , and they said to him : » Show us the entrance into the city , and we will show you mercy . «
When he showed them the entrance into the city , they struck the city with the edge of the sword . But spared the man and all his family .
The man went into the land of the Hittites and built a city . He called it Luz , which is its name this day .
Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and her towns , nor Taanach and her towns , nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns , nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns , nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns : but the Canaanites wanted to live in that land .
When Israel was strong they pressed the Canaanites into forced labor . They did not completely drive them out .
Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that lived in Gezer . But the Canaanites lived among them in Gezer .
Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron , nor the inhabitants of Nahalol ; but the Canaanites dwelt among them , and became forced laborers .
Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho , nor the inhabitants of Zidon , nor of Ahlab , nor of Achzib , nor of Helbah , nor of Aphik , nor of Rehob :
But the Asherites lived among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land : for they did not drive them out .
Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh , nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath ; but he lived among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land : nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became forced laborers to them .
And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain . They would not allow them to come down to the valley .
But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon , and in Shaalbim : yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed , so that they became forced laborers .
The boundary of the Amorites was from the Ascent to Akrabbim , from the rock , and upward .
An angel of Jehovah came up from Gilgal to Bochim , and said : » I led you out of Egypt and brought you to the land about which I swore to your fathers that I would never break my covenant with you .
» You will make no covenant with people of this land . You will throw down their altars . You have not obeyed my voice . Why have you done this ? «
» I also said : ‘ I will not drive them out from before you . They will be thorns in your sides . Their gods will snare trap you . ’ «
When the angel of Jehovah spoke these words to all the children of Israel the people wept loudly .
They called that place Bochim : and they sacrificed there to Jehovah .
When Joshua let the people go the children of Israel went , every man , to his inheritance to possess the land .
The people served Jehovah all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua , who had seen all the great works Jehovah did for Israel .
Joshua son of Nun , the servant of Jehovah , died at the age of a hundred and ten years old .
They buried him on the border of his inheritance in Timnath-Serah , in the mount of Ephraim , on the north side of Gaash hill .
After those generations were gathered to their fathers died another generation followed them . This new generation did not know Jehovah or the works he had done for Israel .
The children of Israel did evil in the sight of Jehovah , and served Baalim :
They forsook Jehovah God of their fathers , which brought them out of the land of Egypt . They followed other gods , of the gods of the people that were round about them . They bowed to them and provoked Jehovah to anger .
They forsook Jehovah and served Baal and Ashtaroth .
The anger of Jehovah was hot against Israel . He delivered them into the hands of raiders who plundered them . He sold them to their enemies round about , so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies .
Wherever they went the hand of Jehovah was against them for evil . For Jehovah had sworn to them and as Jehovah had sworn they were greatly distressed .
Nevertheless Jehovah established judges who delivered them out of the hand of those who plundered them .
Yet they would not listen to their judges , but prostituted themselves to other gods . They worshiped them . They turned quickly , out of the way in which their fathers walked obeying the commandments of Jehovah .
When Jehovah established judges he supported each judge . He delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days the judge lived . He had compassion for them as they groaned under those who oppressed and afflicted them .
When the judge was dead they returned and corrupted themselves more than their fathers . They followed other gods to serve them , and to bow down to them . They did not give up their evil practices and stubborn ways .
The anger of Jehovah was hot against Israel . He said : » Because this people have transgressed my covenant , which I commanded their fathers , and have not listened to my voice ;
» I will not drive out any of the nations that Joshua left when he died .
» That through them I may test Israel , to see whether they will keep the way of Jehovah and walk in it as their fathers did . «
Therefore Jehovah left those nations , without driving them out . He did not deliver them into the hand of Joshua .
Now these are the nations that Jehovah left to test the Israelites who had not known all the wars of Canaan .
He did this to teach warfare to the generations of the children of Israel who had not had previous battle experience .
Those left in the land were the five Philistine cities , all the Canaanites , the Sidonians , and the Hivites who lived in the Lebanon Mountains from Mount Baal Hermon as far as Hamath Pass .
They were to be a test for Israel . This would find out whether or not the Israelites would obey the commandments that Jehovah gave their ancestors through Moses .
The people of Israel settled down among the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Amorites , the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites .
They intermarried with them and worshiped their gods .
The people of Israel forgot Jehovah their God . They sinned against him and worshiped the idols of Baal and Asherah .
Jehovah became angry at Israel and let King Cushan Rishathaim of Mesopotamia conquer them . They were subject to him for eight years .
The Israelites cried out to Jehovah , and he sent someone to free them . This was Othniel , the son of Caleb’s younger brother Kenaz .
The Spirit of Jehovah came upon him , and he became Israel’s leader judge . Othniel went to war , and Jehovah gave him the victory over the king of Mesopotamia .
There was peace in the land for forty years until Othniel died .
The people of Israel sinned against Jehovah again . Because of this Jehovah made King Eglon of Moab stronger than Israel .
Eglon joined the Ammonites and the Amalekites . They defeated Israel and captured Jericho , the city of palm trees .
The Israelites were subject to Eglon for eighteen years .
Then the Israelites cried out to Jehovah . So he sent someone to free them . This was Ehud , a left-handed man , who was the son of Gera , from the tribe of Benjamin . The people of Israel sent Ehud to King Eglon of Moab with gifts for him .
Ehud made himself a double-edged sword about a foot and a half long . He fastened it on his right side under his clothes .
He took the gifts to Eglon , who was a very fat man .
When Ehud gave him the gifts , he told the men who carried them to go back home .
But Ehud turned back at the carved stones near Gilgal , went back to Eglon , and said : » Your Majesty , I have a secret message for you . « So the king ordered his servants : » Leave us alone ! « Then they all went out .
The king was sitting there alone in his cool room on the roof . Ehud went over to him and said : » I have a message from God for you . « The king stood up .
With his left hand Ehud took the sword from his right side and plunged it into the king’s belly .
The whole sword went in , handle and all , and the fat covered it up . Ehud did not pull it out of the king’s belly , and it stuck out behind , between his legs .
Ehud went outside , closed the doors behind him , locked them .
Then he left . The servants came and saw that the doors to the upstairs room were locked . They only thought that the king was inside , relieving himself .
They waited as long as they thought they should . When he still did not open the door , they took the key and opened it . There lying dead on the floor was their master .
Ehud got away while they were waiting . He went past the carved stones and escaped to Seirah .
When he arrived there in the hill country of Ephraim , he blew a trumpet to call the people of Israel to battle . Then he led them down from the hills .
He said to them : » Follow me ! Jehovah has given you victory over your enemies , the Moabites . « So they followed Ehud and captured the place where the Moabites were to cross the Jordan . They did not allow anyone to cross .
They killed about ten thousand of the best Moabite soldiers . None of them escaped .
That day the Israelites defeated Moab . There was peace in the land for eighty years .
The next leader was Shamgar son of Anath . He too rescued Israel , and did so by killing six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad .
After Ehud died , the people of Israel sinned against Jehovah again .
Jehovah let them be conquered by Jabin , a Canaanite king who ruled in the city of Hazor . The commander of his army was Sisera , who lived at Harosheth-Hagoyim .
Jabin had nine hundred iron chariots , and he ruled the people of Israel with cruelty and violence for twenty years . The people of Israel cried out to Jehovah for help .
Now Deborah , the wife of Lappidoth , was a prophet , and she was serving as a judge for the Israelites at that time .
She held court under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim . The children of Israel came to her for judgment .
She sent for Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali , and said to him : » Has Jehovah the God of Israel commanded , saying : ‘ Go and deploy troops at mount Tabor . Take ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun ?
» ‘ And I will lure Sisera , the captain of Jabin’s army , with his chariots and his multitude ; and I will deliver him into your hand . ’ «
Barak said to her : » If you will go with me , then I will go . If you will not go with me I will not go . «
She said : » I will surely go with you . Never the less there will be no glory for you in the journey you are taking . For Jehovah will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman . « Deborah arose , and went with Barak to Kedesh .
Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh ; and he went up with ten thousand men under his command . Deborah went with him .
Now Heber the Kenite , which was of the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses , had severed himself from the Kenites , and pitched his tent at the plain of Zaanaim , which is by Kedesh .
They showed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone to mount Tabor .
Sisera gathered together all his nine hundred chariots of iron , and all the people that were with him , from Harosheth of the nations to the Kishon River .
Deborah said to Barak : » Get up , for this is the day in which Jehovah has delivered Sisera into your hand . Jehovah has gone out before you . « So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him .
Jehovah routed Sisera , and all his chariots , and all his army , with the edge of the sword before Barak . Sisera dismounted his chariot , and fled away on his feet .
But Barak pursued after the chariots , and after the army to Harosheth-Hagoyim . All of Sisera’s army fell by the edge of the sword . Not one person was left .
Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite . There was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite .
Jael went out to meet Sisera , and said to him : » Come my lord , come right in . Do not be afraid . « When he came in to her tent , she covered him with a mantle .
He said to her : » Please give me a little water to drink for I am thirsty . « She opened a jug of milk , and gave him drink , and covered him .
Again he said : » Stand at the door of the tent . When any man comes to inquire and asks : ‘ Is there a man here ? ’ ’ Say : » No . « ’ «
Then Jael Heber’s wife picked up a tent peg and a hammer and went to him while he was fast asleep and drove the peg into his temple and it went down into the ground . He was fast asleep and weary . So he died .
Barak pursued Sisera and Jael came out to meet him . She said to him : » Come , and I will show you the man whom you seek . « He went to her tend and saw Sisera lay dead with the peg in his temple .
So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel .
The children of Israel prospered , and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan , until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan .
That day Deborah and Barak sang this song :
» Praise Jehovah ! The Israelites were determined to fight . The people gladly volunteered .
» Listen , you kings ! Pay attention , you rulers ! I will sing and play music to Israel’s God , Jehovah .
» Jehovah , when you left the mountains of Seir , when you came out of Edom , the earth shook , and rain fell from the sky . Yes , water poured out of the clouds .
» The mountains shook before Jehovah of Sinai , before Jehovah , the God of Israel .
» In the days of Shamgar son of Anath , in the days of Jael , the highways were deserted . Travelers used the back roads .
» The towns of Israel were abandoned . They stood empty until I Deborah came , came like a mother for Israel .
» There was war in the land when the Israelites chose new gods . Of the forty thousand men in Israel , did anyone carry shield or spear ?
» My heart is with the commanders of Israel , with the people who gladly volunteered . Praise Jehovah !
» Speak of it , you who ride on white donkeys , sitting on saddles . You that must walk wherever you go .
» Listen ! The noisy crowds around the wells are telling about Jehovah’s victories , the victories of Israel’s people ! Then Jehovah’s people marched down from their cities .
» Wake up , wake up , Deborah : awake , awake , and utter a song . Arise , Barak , and lead your captives away , you son of Abinoam .
» Then he made those who remain to dominate over the nobles among the people . Jehovah made me have dominion over the mighty .
» They came from Ephraim to the valley . They were behind the tribe of Benjamin and its people . The commanders came down from Machir . The officers came down from Zebulun .
» The leaders of Issachar came with Deborah . Issachar came and Barak too , and they followed him into the valley . But the tribe of Reuben was divided ; they could not decide to come .
» Why did they stay behind with the sheep ? Did they listen to shepherds calling the flocks ? Yes , the tribe of Reuben was divided ; they could not decide to come .
» The tribe of Gad stayed east of the Jordan . The tribe of Dan remained by the ships . The tribe of Asher stayed by the seacoast . They remained by the shore .
» The people of Zebulun and Naphtali risked their lives on the battlefield .
» The kings fought at Taanach , by the stream of Megiddo . The kings of Canaan fought , but they took no silver away .
» As the stars moved across the sky they fought against Sisera .
» The River Kishon swept them away . That ancient flooding river swept them away . March on ! March on and be strong .
» Then the horses hooves thundered and his mighty steeds stamped the ground .
» Curse Meroz , says Jehovah’s angel : Curse those who live there . They did not come to help Jehovah . They did not come as soldiers to fight for him .
» Jael , the wife of Heber the Kenite , is the most blessed of women . The most blessed of women who live in tents .
» Sisera asked for water . She gave him milk . She brought him cream in a beautiful bowl .
» She took a tent peg in one hand and hammer in the other . She struck Sisera and crushed his skull . Yes , she pierced him through the head .
» He sank to his knees and fell down at her feet . At her feet he sank . He fell to the ground , dead .
» Sisera’s mother looked thru the window . From behind the lattice she looked . Why is his chariot so late in coming ? She asked . Why are his horses so slow to return ?
» The wisest of her ladies answered her , and she told herself over and over ,
» They are finding things to capture and divide . They find a woman or two for every soldier , rich cloth for Sisera , embroidered pieces for the queen .
» May all your enemies die like that , Jehovah , may your friends shine like the rising sun ! There was peace in the land for forty years . «
Again the people of Israel sinned against Jehovah . Therefore he let the people of Midian rule them for seven years .
The Midianites were very oppressive over Israel . So much so that the people of Israel hid from them in caves and other safe places in the mountains .
When the Israelites planted their crops , the Midianites and the Amalekites along with the desert tribes attacked them .
They camped on the land and destroyed the crops as far south as Gaza . They took all the sheep , cattle , and donkeys , and left nothing for the Israelites to live on .
They came with their livestock and tents , as thick as locusts . It was impossible to count the men and their camels . They entered the land and destroyed it .
Israel was helpless against them .
The people of Israel cried out to Jehovah for help against the Midianites .
Then Jehovah sent a man , a prophet , to the Israelites . He said to them : » Jehovah , the God of Israel says , ‘ It was I who brought you out of slavery in Egypt .
» ‘ I rescued you from the Egyptians and from the people who fought you in this land . I drove them out as you advanced . I gave you their land .
» ‘ I said to you : ‘ I am Jehovah your God . You should not worship the gods of the Amorites , whose land you are now living in . But you have not listened to me . ’ «
The angel of Jehovah came to the village of Ophrah . He sat under the oak tree that belonged to Joash , a man of the clan of Abiezer . His son Gideon was secretly threshing wheat in a wine press , so that the Midianites would not see him .
Jehovah’s angel appeared to him there and said : » Jehovah is with you , mighty man of valor ! «
Gideon said to him : » May I ask , sir , why has all this happened to us if Jehovah is with us ? What happened to all the wonderful things that our fathers told us Jehovah used to do , how he brought them out of Egypt ? Jehovah has abandoned us . He left us to the mercy of the Midianites . «
Jehovah answered him : » Go in the strength you have and rescue Israel from the Midianites . I am sending you . «
Gideon replied : » But Jehovah , how can I rescue Israel ? My clan is the weakest in the tribe of Manasseh . I am the least important member of my family . «
Jehovah answered : » You can do it . I will help you . You will crush the Midianites as easily as if they were only one man . «
Gideon replied : » If you are pleased with me , give me proof that you are really Jehovah .
» Please do not leave until I return and bring you an offering . « Jehovah said : » I will stay until you come back . «
So Gideon went into his house and cooked a young goat and used a bushel of flour to make bread without any yeast . He put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot , brought them to Jehovah’s angel under the oak tree , and gave them to him .
The angel told him : » Put the meat and the bread on this rock , and pour the broth over them . « Gideon did so .
Jehovah’s angel reached out and touched the meat and the bread with the end of the stick he was holding . Fire came out of the rock and burned up the meat and the bread . Then the angel disappeared .
With that Gideon realized that it was Jehovah’s angel he saw . He said in terror : » Sovereign Lord Jehovah ! I have seen your angel face-to-face ! «
Jehovah told him : » Peace . Do not be afraid . You will not die . «
Gideon built an altar to Jehovah there and named it : » Jehovah is Peace . « Jehovah-shalom It is still standing at Ophrah and belongs to the clan of Abiezer .
That night Jehovah told Gideon : » Take your father’s bull and another seven year old bull , tear down your father’s altar to Baal , and cut down the symbol of the goddess Asherah , that is beside it .
» Build a well-constructed altar to Jehovah your God on top of this mound . Take the second bull and burn it as a whole offering . Cut down the symbol of Asherah and use it for firewood . «
So Gideon took ten of his servants and did what Jehovah instructed him to do . He was afraid of his family and the people in town , so he did it at night .
The people in town got up early the next morning . They found that the altar to Baal and the symbol of Asherah had been cut down . The second bull had been burned on the altar that was built there .
They asked each other : » Who did this ? « They investigated and found out that Gideon , son of Joash , did it .
They said to Joash : » Bring your son here . We will kill him ! « He tore down the altar to Baal and cut down the symbol of Asherah !
Joash replied : » Are you arguing for Baal ? Are you defending him ? Anyone who argues for him will be killed before morning . If Baal really is a god he can defend himself . It is his altar that was torn down . «
From then on Gideon was known as Jerubbaal , because Joash said : » Let Baal defend himself for his altar was torn down . «
The Midianites , Amalekites , and the desert tribes assembled , crossed the Jordan River , and camped in Jezreel Valley .
The Spirit of Jehovah took control of Gideon . He blew a trumpet to call the men of the clan of Abiezer to follow him .
He sent messengers throughout the territory of both parts of Manasseh to call them to follow him . He sent messengers to the tribes of Asher , Zebulun , and Naphtali , and they also came to join him .
Gideon said to God : » You have said you will rescue Israel using me .
» Look I will place wool on the threshing floor where we thresh the wheat . If in the morning there is dew only on the wool but not on the ground , I will know that you are going to use me to rescue Israel . «
That is what happened . When Gideon got up early the next morning , he squeezed the wool and wrung enough dew out of it to fill a bowl with water .
Then Gideon said to God : » Do not be angry with me . Allow me to speak just once more . Please let me make one more test with the wool . This time let the wool be dry , and the ground wet . «
That night God did it . The next morning the wool was dry , but the ground was wet with dew .
Gideon and all his men got up early and camped beside Harod Spring . The Midianite camp was in the valley to the north of them by Moreh Hill .
Jehovah said to Gideon : » The men you have are too many for me to give them victory over the Midianites . They might think that they had won by themselves and not give me credit .
» Announce to the people : ‘ Anyone who is afraid should go back home . ’ ’ We will stay here at Mount Gilead . Twenty-two thousand went back , but ten thousand stayed . ’ «
Jehovah said to Gideon : » You still have too many men . Take them down to the water , and I will separate them for you . If I tell you a man should go with you , he will go . If I tell you a man should not go with you , he will not go . «
Gideon took the men to the water . Jehovah told him : » Separate everyone who laps up the water with his tongue like a dog , from everyone who gets down on his knees to drink . «
There were three hundred men who scooped up water in their hands and lapped it . The others got down on their knees to drink .
Jehovah said : » I will rescue you and give you victory over the Midianites . Use the three hundred men who lapped the water . Tell everyone else to go home . «
Gideon sent the Israelites home , except the three hundred . They kept all the supplies and trumpets . The Midianite camp was below them in the valley .
That night Jehovah commanded Gideon : » Get up and attack the camp . I give you victory over it !
» If you are afraid to attack , go to the camp with your servant Purah .
» You will hear what they are saying , and then you will have the courage to attack . « Gideon and his servant Purah went to the edge of the enemy camp .
The Midianites , the Amalekites , and the desert tribesmen were spread out in the valley like a swarm of locusts . They had so many camels they could not be counted . They were as plentiful as there are grains of sand on the seashore .
When Gideon arrived , he heard a man telling a friend about a dream . He was saying : » I dreamed that a loaf of barley bread rolled into our camp and hit a tent . The tent collapsed and lay flat on the ground . «
His friend responded : » This is nothing else but the sword of Gideon , the son of Joash . For God delivered Midian and its army to this man of Israel . «
When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation he worshiped God . He returned to the camp of Israel , and called out : » Arise ! Jehovah has delivered the camp of Midian into your hand . «
He divided the three hundred men into three companies . He put a trumpet in every man’s hand , with empty jars , and lamps within the jars .
He said to them : » Look at me , and do as I do . When I come to the outside of the camp do the same as I do .
» When I blow the trumpet , all who are with me should blow the trumpets . Blow the trumpets on every side of the camp and say : ‘ The sword of Jehovah , and of Gideon ! ’ «
Gideon and the hundred men , who were with him , came to the outside of the camp . It was the beginning of the middle watch and they had just posted the new watch . They blew the trumpets , and broke the jars that were in their hands .
The three companies blew the trumpets , and broke the jars , and held the lamps in their left hands , and the trumpets in their right hands . Then they cried : » The sword of Jehovah , and of Gideon ! «
Every man stood in his place around the camp . The army ran , and cried , and fled .
The three hundred blew the trumpets . Jehovah set every man’s sword against his companions . They turned on each other throughout all the army . The army fled to Beth-shittah in Zererath , and to the border of Abel-meholah , to Tabbath .
The men of Israel gathered together out of Naphtali , and out of Asher , and out of all Manasseh , and pursued after the Midianites .
Gideon sent messengers through all the hill country of Ephraim to say : » Come down and fight the Midianites ! Hold the Jordan River and the streams as far as Bethbarah , to keep the Midianites from crossing them . « The men of Ephraim were called together , and they held the Jordan River and the streams as far as Bethbarah .
They captured the two Midianite chiefs , Oreb and Zeeb ; they killed Oreb at Oreb Rock , and Zeeb at the Winepress of Zeeb . They continued to pursue the Midianites and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon , who was now east of the Jordan .
Then the people of Ephraim said to Gideon : » Why did you not call us when you went to fight the Midianites ? Why did you treat us like this ? « They complained bitterly about it .
He said : » What have I accomplished compared to you ? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abi-ezer ?
» God delivered the princes of Midian , Oreb and Zeeb , to you . What was I able to do in comparison to you ? « Then their anger toward him subsided at what he said .
Gideon and his three hundred men passed over the Jordan . Their pursuit continued .
He said to the men of Succoth : » Give my troops some bread . They are tired . I am still pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna , the kings of Midian . «
The princes of Succoth said : » Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand , that we should give bread to your army ? «
Gideon said : » When Jehovah delivers Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand , then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers . «
He went up to Penuel and made the same request of them . The men of Penuel gave the same answer as the men of Succoth .
He spoke to the men of Penuel : » When I come again in peace , I will break down this tower . «
Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor . Their armies were with them , about fifteen thousand men all that were left of all the armies of the children of the east . They had already lost a hundred and twenty thousand swordsmen .
Gideon went up by the way of the nomads who lived in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah . They attacked the army while the camp felt secure .
When Zebah and Zalmunna fled , he pursued them and captured them and routed the entire army .
Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun came up at Heres Pass .
He captured a young man from Succoth and questioned him . He described the princes of Succoth , and the elders and even seventy-seven men .
Then Gideon went to the men of Sukkoth and said : » Remember when you refused to help me ? You said that you could not give any food to my exhausted army because I had not captured Zebah and Zalmunna yet . Well , here they are ! «
Then he took the elders of the town and had them crushed on a bed of thorns and sharp stems .
He tore down the tower at Penuel . He also killed the men of that city .
Then Gideon asked Zebah and Zalmunna : » What kind of men were the men you killed at Tabor ? « They answered : » They looked like you , every one of them like the son of a king . «
He said : » They were my brothers , the sons of my mother . As Jehovah lives , if you had saved them alive , I will not kill you . «
He said to Jether his firstborn : » Rise up and kill them . « But the youth would not draw his sword . He was afraid because he was still a youth .
Zebah and Zalmunna said to Gideon : » Kill us yourself . It takes a man to do this job . « Gideon killed them and took the ornaments that were on the necks of their camels .
The Israelites said to Gideon : » Be our ruler , you and your descendants after you . You saved us from the Midianites . «
Gideon answered : » I will not be your ruler , nor will my son . Jehovah will be your ruler ! «
He also said : » Let me ask one thing of you . Every one of you must give me the earrings you took . « The Midianites wore gold earrings .
They answered : » We will gladly give them to you . « They spread out a cloth , and everyone put the earrings that he had taken on it .
The gold earrings that Gideon got weighed over forty pounds . This did not include the ornaments , necklaces , and purple clothes that the kings of Midian wore . It also did not include the collars that were around the necks of their camels .
Gideon made an idol from the gold and placed it in his hometown , Ophrah . The Israelites abandoned God and went there to worship the idol . It was a trap for Gideon and his family .
Midian was defeated by the Israelites and was no longer a threat . The land was at peace for forty years , until Gideon died .
Gideon went back to his home and lived there .
He had many wives and seventy sons .
He also kept a concubine in Shechem . She bore him a son , and he named him Abimelech .
Gideon son of Joash died at an old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash , at Ophrah . Ophrah was the town of the clan of Abiezer .
After Gideon’s death the people of Israel were unfaithful to God again . They worshiped the Baals . They made Baal-Berith their god .
They no longer served Jehovah their God , who had saved them from all their enemies around them .
They did not show kindness to the family of Gideon for all the good that he had done for Israel .
Gideon’s son Abimelech went to the town of Shechem . All his mother’s relatives lived there . He told them :
» Ask the men of Shechem : ‘ Which is better for you . To have all seventy of Gideon’s sons govern you or to have just one man ? Remember that Abimelech is your own flesh and blood . ’ «
His mother’s relatives talked to the men of Shechem about this for him . The men of Shechem decided to follow Abimelech because : » He is our relative . «
They gave him seventy pieces of silver from the temple of Baal-Berith . Abimelech hired worthless and reckless men to join him .
He went to his father’s house at Ophrah . There on top of a single stone he killed his seventy brothers , Gideon’s sons . Gideon’s youngest son Jotham hid and therefore was not killed .
All the men of Shechem and Bethmillo got together and went to the sacred oak tree at Shechem , where they made Abimelech king .
Jotham heard about this . He stood on top of Mount Gerizim and shouted out to them : » Men of Shechem , listen to me and God may listen to you !
» The trees went out to anoint a king over them . They said to the olive tree : ‘ Be our king . ’
» ‘ The olive tree answered : ‘ I would have to stop producing my oil in order to govern you . My oil is used to honor gods and human beings . ’
» ‘ Then the trees said to the fig tree : ‘ Come and be our king . ’
» ‘ The fig tree replied : ‘ I would have to stop producing my good sweet fruit that I may govern you . ’
» ‘ Then the trees spoke to the grapevine : ‘ You come and be our king . ’
» ‘ But the vine answered : ‘ I could not govern you for I would have to stop producing my wine . It makes gods and human beings happy . ’
» ‘ So then all the trees said to the thorn bush : ‘ You come and be our king ! «
» ‘ The thorn bush answered : ‘ If you really want to make me your king , then come and take shelter in my shade . If you do not , fire will blaze out of my thorny branches and burn up the cedars of Lebanon . ’
» ‘ Think about it , Jotham continued : ‘ Were you really honest and sincere when you made Abimelech king ? Have you respected Gideon’s memory ? Did you treat his family properly , as his actions deserved ?
» ‘ My father fought for you . He risked his life to deliver you from the Midianites .
» ‘ Today you turned against my father’s family . You killed his sons , seventy men on a single stone . And this because Abimelech , his son by his servant woman , is your relative , you have made him king of Shechem .
» ‘ If you have acted in truth and sincerity today to Gideon and his family then be happy with Abimelech and let him be happy with you .
» ‘ But if not , may fire blaze out from Abimelech and burn up the men of Shechem and Bethmillo . May fire blaze out from the men of Shechem and Bethmillo and burn Abimelech up . ’ «
Jotham ran away to Beer and lived there , for fear of Abimelech his brother .
When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel ,
God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem . The men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech :
That the cruelty done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might be avenged on their brother Abimelech . For he killed them and the men of Shechem helped him kill his brother .
And the men of Shechem set men in ambush on the top of the mountains . They robbed all who came along that way . This was reported to Abimelech .
Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers , and went over to Shechem : and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him .
They all went to their vineyards and picked the grapes . Then they made wine from them , and held a festival . They went to the temple of their god , where they ate and drank and made fun of Abimelech .
Gaal said : » Who is Abimelech and who is Schechem that we should serve them ? Who is he ? The son of Gideon ! And Zebul takes orders from him , but why should we serve him ? Be loyal to your ancestor Hamor , the one who founded your clan !
» If I were leading this people I would get rid of Abimelech ! I would tell him to : call out your army , come on out and fight ! «
The ruler of the city , Zebul , became angry when he heard what Gaal said .
He sent messengers to Abimelech at Arumah . They said : » Gaal son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem . They are not going to let you enter into the city .
» You and your men should move by night and hide in the fields .
» Get up early in the morning at sunrise and attack the city . When he and the people who are with him come out against you do what you can against them . «
Abimelech and all his troops , in four companies , took up concealed positions at night against Shechem .
Abimelech and his men saw Gaal come out and stand at the city gate . So they got up from their hiding places .
Gaal saw them and said to Zebul : » There are men coming down from the mountaintops ! « Zebul answered : » They are not men . They are only shadows on the mountains . «
Gaal responded : » Do you see ? There are men coming down from the top of the mountain . Some are coming along the road from the big tree of Meonenim big tree of magic ! «
Zebul said to him : » Where is all your big talk now ? You asked why we should serve this man Abimelech . These are the men you made fun of . You go fight them ! «
Gaal led the men of Shechem out to fight Abimelech .
Abimelech chased Gaal , and Gaal ran away . Many were wounded at the city gate .
Abimelech lived in Arumah . Zebul drove Gaal and his brothers out of Shechem . They could no longer live there .
The next day it was reported to Abimelech that the people of Shechem were planning to go out into the fields .
He divided his men into three groups . They hid in the fields , waiting . When he saw the people come out of the city , he came out of hiding to kill them .
Abimelech and his group rushed forward to guard the city gate . The other two companies attacked the people in the fields and killed all of them .
The fighting lasted all day . Abimelech captured the city and killed its people . He tore down the city and covered the ground with salt .
When all the men in the fort at Shechem heard this , they sought safety in the stronghold of the temple of Baal-Berith .
Abimelech was informed that they had gathered there ,
He traveled up to Mount Zalmon with his men . He took an ax , cut a limb off a tree , and put it on his shoulder . He told his men to hurry and do the same thing .
So everyone cut off a tree limb . They followed Abimelech and piled the wood up against the stronghold . They set the fort on fire . All the people of the fort died . About a thousand men and women died .
Then Abimelech went to Thebez . They surrounded that city , and captured it .
There was a strong tower there . The men and women in the city , including the leaders , ran to it . They locked themselves in and went up to the roof .
When Abimelech attacked the tower he went to the door to set the tower on fire .
A woman threw a millstone down on his head and fractured his skull .
He quickly called the young man who was carrying his weapons and told him : » Draw your sword and kill me . I do not want it said that a woman killed me . « The young man ran him through with his sword and he died .
The Israelites went home as soon as they saw that Abimelech was dead .
Thus God paid Abimelech back for the crime that he committed against his father in killing his seventy brothers .
God also made the men of Shechem suffer for their wickedness . Jotham , Gideon’s son , said they would when he cursed them .
After Abimelech died Tola , the son of Puah and grandson of Dodo , came to save Israel . He was from the tribe of Issachar and lived at Shamir in the mountains of Ephraim .
He was Israel’s judge leader for twenty-three years . Then he died and was buried at Shamir .
After Tola came Jair from Gilead . He judged led Israel for twenty-two years .
He had thirty sons who rode thirty donkeys . They had thirty cities in the land of Gilead . They are called the villages of Jair .
Jair died and was buried at Kamon .
Once again the Israelites did evil against Jehovah by worshiping the Baals and the Astartes . They also worshiped the gods of Syria , of Sidon , of Moab , of Ammon , and of the Philistines . They abandoned Jehovah and stopped worshiping him .
The anger of Jehovah burned against Israel . So he allowed the Philistines and the Ammonites to conquer them .
They afflicted and oppressed the sons of Israel . For eighteen years they lived in Amorite country east of the Jordan River in Gilead .
The Ammonites crossed the Jordan to fight the tribes of Judah , Benjamin , and Ephraim . Israel was greatly distressed .
The children of Israel cried out to Jehovah : » We sinned against you . We left our God and served the Baals . «
Jehovah answered : » Did I free you from the Egyptians , the Amorites , the Ammonites , and the Philistines ?
» Did I save you from the Sidonians , the Amalekites , and the Maonites ? They oppressed you and you cried out to me .
» You still left me and worshiped other gods . I am not going to rescue you again .
» Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen ! Let them save you in your time of trouble . «
But the people of Israel said to Jehovah : » We have sinned . Do to us what seems best to you , only please , save us today ! «
So they removed the foreign gods and worshiped Jehovah . He could bear the distress of Israel no longer .
Then the Ammonite army prepared camped in Gilead . They prepared for battle . The people of Israel gathered and camped at Mizpah in Gilead .
There the people and the leaders of Gilead asked one another : » Who is the man to lead the fight against the Ammonites ? Whoever does will be the leader of everyone in Gilead . «
Jephthah was a brave soldier from Gilead . He was the son of a prostitute . Gilead was his father .
They had other sons by his wife , and when they grew up , they forced Jephthah to leave home . They told him : » You will have no inheritance from our father for you are the son of another woman . «
Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob . There a group of worthless men joined with him and they went around together .
After time passed the Ammonites went to war against Israel .
When this war occurred , the leaders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah back from the land of Tob .
They said : » Come and be our commander , so that we can fight the Ammonites . «
Jephthah answered : » You hated me so much that you forced me to leave my father’s house . Why have you come to me now that you are in trouble ? «
They replied : » We turn to you now because we want you to go with us and fight the Ammonites and lead all the people of Gilead . «
Jephthah said : » If you take me back home to fight the Ammonites and Jehovah gives me victory , will I be your ruler ? «
They replied : » We agree . Jehovah is our witness . «
Jephthah went with the leaders of Gilead . The people made him their ruler and leader . Jephthah stated his terms at Mizpah in Jehovah’s presence .
Jephthah sent messengers to the king of Ammon . He said : » What do you have against us that you want to fight us ? Why have you invaded our country ? «
The king of Ammon answered Jephthah’s messengers : » Because Israel took away our land when they came out of Egypt . They took land from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River and the Jordan River . Now you must give it back peacefully . «
Jephthah sent messengers back to the king of Ammon .
This was his answer : » It is not true that Israel took away the land of Moab or the land of Ammon .
» It happened this way : ‘ when the Israelites left Egypt , they went through the desert to the Gulf of Aqaba and came to Kadesh .
» ‘ They sent messengers to the king of Edom to ask permission to go through his land . But the king of Edom would not let them . They also asked the king of Moab , but he would not let them go through his land . So the people of Israel stayed at Kadesh .
» ‘ Then they went through the desert around the land of Edom and the land of Moab until they came to the east side of Moab , on the other side of the Arnon River . They camped there , but they did not cross the Arnon because it was the boundary of Moab .
» ‘ The people of Israel sent messengers to Sihon , the Amorite king of Heshbon . They asked him for permission to go through his country to their own land .
» ‘ But Sihon refused to let Israel do it . He brought his whole army together , camped at Jahaz , and attacked Israel .
» ‘ Jehovah , the God of Israel , gave the people of Israel victory over Sihon and his army . So the people of Israel took possession of all the territory of the Amorites who lived in that country .
» ‘ They occupied all the Amorite territory from the Arnon in the south to the Jabbok in the north and from the desert on the east to the Jordan on the west .
» ‘ Jehovah , the God of Israel , drove out the Amorites for his people , the people of Israel .
» ‘ Are you going to try to take it back ? You can keep whatever your god Chemosh has given you . But we are going to keep everything Jehovah , our God , has taken for us .
» ‘ Do you think you are better than Balak son of Zippor , king of Moab ? Did he ever challenge Israel or fight with them ?
» ‘ Israel has occupied Heshbon and Aroer for three hundred years , and the towns around them , and all the cities on the banks of the Arnon River . Why did you not retake them during that time ?
» ‘ I have not done you any wrong . You are doing wrong to me by making war on me . Jehovah is the judge . He will decide today between the Israelites and the Ammonites . ’ «
The king of Ammon paid no attention to this message from Jephthah .
The Spirit of Jehovah came upon Jephthah . He went through Gilead and Manasseh and returned to Mizpah in Gilead and went on to Ammon .
Jephthah promised Jehovah : » If you give me victory over the Ammonites ,
» I will sacrifice with a burnt offering the first person that comes out of my house to meet me , when I return from the victory . I will offer that person to you as a sacrifice . «
Jephthah crossed the river to fight the Ammonites , and Jehovah gave him victory .
He struck at them from Aroer to the area around Minnith , twenty cities in all , and as far as Abel Keramim . It was a great slaughter . The Ammonites were defeated by Israel .
Jephthah went back home to Mizpah . His daughter came out to meet him , dancing and playing the tambourine . She was his only child .
When he saw her , he ripped his clothes in sorrow and said : » Oh , my daughter ! My heart is breaking ! Why must it be you ? I have made a solemn promise to Jehovah , and I cannot take it back ! «
She said : » If you made a promise to Jehovah , do what you said you would do to me , since Jehovah has given you revenge on your enemies , the Ammonites . «
She asked her father : » Do this for me . Leave me alone for two months , so that I can go with my friends to wander in the mountains and grieve that I must die a virgin . «
He sent her away for two months . She and her friends went up into the mountains and grieved because she was going to die unmarried and childless .
She returned to her father after two months . He did what he had promised Jehovah , and she died still a virgin . This was the origin of the custom in Israel .
The Israelite women would go out for four days every year to grieve for the daughter of Jephthah of Gilead .
The men of Ephraim were ready for battle . They crossed the Jordan River to Zaphon and said to Jephthah : » Why did you cross the border to fight the Ammonites without calling us to go with you ? We are going to burn the house down over your head ! «
Jephthah replied : » My people and I had a great struggle with the Ammonites . I called you , but you would not rescue me from them .
» When I realized you were not going to , I risked my life and crossed the border to fight them . Jehovah gave me victory over them . Why are you coming to fight me now ? «
Jephthah brought all the men of Gilead together and fought the men of Ephraim and defeated them .
To keep the Ephraimites from escaping , the Gileadites captured the places where the Jordan could be crossed . When any Ephraimite who was trying to escape would ask permission to cross , the men of Gilead would ask : » Are you an Ephraimite ? « If he said : » No , «
they would tell him to say » Shibboleth . « But he would say » Sibboleth , « because he could not pronounce it correctly . Then they would kill him at the Jordan River crossing . Forty-two thousand of the Ephraimites were killed .
Jephthah led Israel for six years . Then he died and was buried in his hometown in Gilead .
After Jephthah , Ibzan from Bethlehem led Israel .
He had thirty sons and thirty daughters . He gave his daughters in marriage outside the clan and brought thirty young women from outside the clan for his sons to marry . Ibzan led Israel for seven years ,
then he died and was buried at Bethlehem .
After Ibzan , Elon from Zebulun led Israel for ten years .
He died and was buried at Aijalon in the territory of Zebulun .
After Elon , Abdon son of Hillel from Pirathon was leader of Israel .
He had forty sons and thirty grandsons , who rode on seventy donkeys . Abdon led Israel for eight years ,
Abdon died and was buried at Pirathon in the territory of Ephraim in the mountains of the Amalekites .
The Israelites sinned against Jehovah again . So he let the Philistines rule them for forty years .
There was a man named Manoah from the town of Zorah . He was a member of the tribe of Dan . His wife was not able to have children .
Jehovah’s angel appeared to her and said : » You have not been able to have children , but you will become pregnant and have a son .
» Do not drink any wine or beer , or eat any forbidden food .
» After your son is born never cut his hair . This is because from the day of his birth he will be dedicated to God as a Nazirite . He will begin the work of delivering Israel from the Philistines . «
Then the woman told her husband : » A man of God came to me . He looked as frightening as the angel of God . I did not ask him where he came from , and he did not tell me his name .
» He told me I would become pregnant and have a son . He told me : ‘ Do not drink any wine or beer , or eat any forbidden food . This is because the boy is to be dedicated to God as a Nazirite as long as he lives . ’ «
Then Manoah prayed to Jehovah : » Please , Jehovah , let the man of God that you sent come back to teach us what we must do with the boy when he is born . «
God did what Manoah asked . His angel came back to the woman while she was in the field . Her husband Manoah was not with her ,
She ran to tell him , » The man who came to me the other day appeared to me again . «
Manoah followed his wife to the man and asked , » Are you the man who talked to my wife ? « » Yes , « he answered .
Manoah said : » When your words come true , what must the boy do ? What kind of a life must he live ? «
Jehovah’s angel answered : » Your wife must be sure to do everything I told her .
» She must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine . She must not drink any wine or beer , or eat any forbidden food . She must do everything I told her to do . «
Not knowing that it was Jehovah’s angel , Manoah said : » Please do not go yet . Let us cook a young goat for you . «
The angel replied : » If I stay I will not eat your food . But if you want to prepare it , burn it as an offering to Jehovah . «
Manoah replied : » Tell us your name . We want to honor you when your words come true . «
The angel asked : » Why do you want to know my name ? It is ‘ Wonderful . ’ «
So Manoah took a young goat and some grain , and offered them on the rock altar to Jehovah the God who works wonders .
While the flames were going up from the altar , Manoah and his wife saw Jehovah’s angel go up toward heaven in the flames . They did not see the angel again .
Manoah knew then that the man was Jehovah’s angel . He and his wife fell on their faces to the ground .
Manoah told his wife : » We will die , for we have seen God a God-like being ! «
His wife answered : » If Jehovah wanted to kill us he would not accept our offerings . He would not have shown us all this or told us these things . «
The woman gave birth to a son and named him Samson . The child grew and Jehovah blessed him .
Jehovah’s power strengthened him while he was between Zorah and Eshtaol in the Camp of Dan .
One day Samson traveled to Timnah . He noticed a young Philistine woman .
He went home and told his father and mother : » A Philistine woman at Timnah caught my attention . Get her for me . I want to marry her . «
His father and mother asked him : » Why do you go to those heathen Philistines to get a wife ? Can you not find someone in our own family or among all our people ? « Samson told his father : » I like her ! She is the one I want . Get her for me . «
His parents did not know Jehovah was leading Samson to do this . Jehovah was looking for an opportunity to fight the Philistines . At this time the Philistines were ruling Israel .
Samson went to Timnah with his father and mother . When they traveled through the vineyards he heard a young lion roaring .
Suddenly the power of Jehovah made Samson strong . He tore the lion apart with his bare hands , as if it were a young goat . But he did not tell his parents what he had done .
Then he went and talked to the young woman . He wanted her .
A few days later Samson returned to marry her . On the way he left the road to look at the lion he had killed . He found a swarm of bees and some honey inside the dead body .
He scraped the honey out into his hands and ate it as he walked along . Then he went to his father and mother and gave them some . They ate it , but Samson did not tell them that he had taken the honey from the dead body of a lion .
Samson’s father went to the woman’s house . Samson gave a banquet there . This was a custom among the young men .
The Philistines saw him . They sent thirty companions to stay with him .
Samson said to them : » Let me tell you a riddle . If you can tell me the meaning before the seven days of the wedding feast are over , I will give each of you a piece of fine linen and a change of fine clothes . « » Tell us your riddle , « they said : » Let us hear it . «
» If you cannot tell me the answer you must give me thirty pieces of fine linen and thirty sets of fine clothes . « » Tell us the riddle , « they said .
He said : » Out of the eater came something to eat ; Out of the strong came something sweet . « Three days later they still could not figure out the riddle .
On the fourth day they said to Samson’s wife : » Trick your husband into telling us what the riddle means . If you do not , we will burn your father’s house with you in it . Did you invite us here to rob us ? «
Samson’s wife approached him in tears and said : » You do not love me ! You just hate me ! You told my friends a riddle and did not tell me it’s meaning ! « He said : » I have not told my father and mother . Why should I tell you ? «
She cried about it for the whole seven days of the feast . She nagged him so that on the seventh day he told her what the riddle meant . Then she told the Philistines .
On the seventh day , before Samson went into the bedroom , the men of the city said to him : » What could be sweeter than honey ? What could be stronger than a lion ? « Samson replied : » If you had not been plowing with my cow , you would not know the answer now . «
Suddenly the power of Jehovah made him strong . He went to Ashkelon , where he killed thirty men . He stripped them and gave their fine clothes to the men who had solved the riddle . He returned home , furious about what had happened .
His wife was given to his best man at the wedding .
Later Samson went to visit his wife during the wheat harvest and took her a young goat . He told her father : » Let me go to my wife in her room . But he would not let him go in . «
He told Samson : » I thought that you hated her , so I gave her to your friend . Her younger sister is prettier . You can have her , instead . «
Samson said : » This time I am not going to be responsible for what I do to the Philistines ! «
He caught three hundred foxes . Two at a time , he tied their tails together and put torches in the knots .
Then he set fire to the torches and turned the foxes loose in the Philistine wheat fields . In this way he burned up both the shocks and the standing grain still in the fields . The olive orchards were also burned .
When the Philistines asked who had done this , they learned that Samson had done it because his father-in-law , a man from Timnah , had given Samson’s wife to a friend of Samson’s . So the Philistines burned the woman to death and burned down her father’s house .
Samson said to them : » This is how you act ! I swear that I will not stop until I pay you back ! «
He attacked them fiercely and killed many of them . After that he stayed in the cave in the cliff at Etam .
The Philistines came and camped in Judah . They attacked the town of Lehi .
The men of Judah asked : » Why do you attack us ? « They answered : » We came to take Samson prisoner and to treat him as he treated us . «
These three thousand men of Judah went to the cave in the cliff at Etam and said to Samson : » Do you know that the Philistines are our rulers ? What did you do ? « He answered : » I did to them just what they did to me . «
They replied : » We have come here to tie you up and hand you over to them . « Samson said : » Give me your word that you will not kill me . «
They said : » We are only going to tie you up and hand you over to them . We will not kill you . « So they tied him up with two new ropes and brought him back from the cliff .
When he got to Lehi , the Philistines shouted and ran toward him . Suddenly Jehovah’s power made him strong . He broke the ropes around his arms and hands as if they were burnt flax .
Samson found a fresh jawbone of a donkey . He picked it up , and killed a thousand men with it .
Then Samson said : » With the jawbone of a donkey I piled them in piles . With the jawbone of a donkey I killed a thousand men . «
When he finished speaking he threw the jawbone away . The place where this happened was named Ramath Lehi .
Samson became very thirsty . He called to Jehovah : » You gave me this great victory . Will I now die of thirst and be captured by these heathen Philistines ? «
God opened a hollow place in the ground there at Lehi , and water came out of it . Samson drank it and felt better . The spring was named Hakkore . It still exists there at Lehi .
Samson judged Israel for twenty years while the Philistines ruled the land .
Samson went to the Philistine city of Gaza . He met a prostitute and went to bed with her .
The people of Gaza discovered that Samson was there . They surrounded the place and waited for him all night long at the city gate . They were quiet all night , thinking : » We will wait until daybreak and kill him . «
However Samson stayed in bed until midnight . He got up and took hold of the city gate and pulled it up , doors , posts , lock , and all . He put them on his shoulders and carried them far off to the top of the hill overlooking Hebron .
After this , Samson fell in love with a woman named Delilah , who lived in Sorek Valley .
The five Philistine kings said to her : » Entice Samson into telling you why he is so strong and how we can overpower him . Tie him up , and make him helpless . Each one of us will give you eleven hundred pieces of silver . «
Delilah said to Samson : » Tell me what makes you so strong . How could you be subdued and tied up ? «
Samson answered : » If they tie me up with seven new bowstrings that are not dried out , I ’ ll be as weak as anybody else . «
The Philistine kings brought Delilah seven new bowstrings that were not dried out , and she tied Samson up .
She had some men waiting in another room , so she shouted : » Samson ! The Philistines are coming ! « But he snapped the bowstrings just as thread breaks when fire touches it . They still did not know the secret of his strength .
Delilah told Samson : » You made a fool of me . What is the truth ? Please tell me how someone could tie you up . «
He said : » If I am tied with new unused ropes I will be weak . «
Delilah tied him with new ropes . Then she shouted : » Samson ! The Philistines are coming ! « The men were waiting in another room . However he snapped the ropes off his arms like thread .
Delilah said to Samson : » You still make a fool of me . What is the truth ? Tell me how someone could tie you up . « He told her : » If you weave my seven locks of hair into a loom , and make it tight with a peg , I will be weak . «
Delilah lulled him to sleep . She took his seven locks of hair and wove them into the loom . She made it tight with a peg and shouted : » Samson ! The Philistines are coming ! « He woke up and pulled his hair loose from the loom .
» How can you say you love me , « she asked : » when you do not mean it ? You have made a fool of me three times . You still have not told me what makes you strong . «
She kept asking him , day after day . He got sick and tired of her nagging him .
So finally he told her the truth : » My hair has never been cut , « he said : » I have been dedicated to God as a Nazirite from the time I was born . I would lose my strength if my hair were cut . «
When Delilah realized that he told her the truth , she sent a message to the Philistine kings : » Come back one more time . He told me the truth . They came and brought the money with them . «
Delilah lulled Samson to sleep in her lap and called a man , who cut off Samson’s seven locks of hair . Then she tormented him , for he had lost his strength .
She shouted : » Samson ! The Philistines are coming ! « He woke up and thought : » I will get loose and go free , as always . « He did not know that Jehovah had left him .
The Philistines captured him and put his eyes out . They took him to Gaza , chained him with copper chains . They put him to work grinding at the mill in the prison .
His hair grew back .
The Philistine kings met together to offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon . They rejoiced and said : » Our god gave us victory over our enemy Samson ! «
They praised their god and said : » Call Samson , and make him entertain us ! « They brought Samson out of the prison and they made him entertain them .
They forced him to stand between the columns . When the people saw him , they sang praise to their god : » Our god gave us victory over our enemy , who devastated our land and killed so many of us ! «
Samson said to the boy who led him by the hand : » Let me touch the columns that hold up the building . I want to lean on them . «
The building was crowded with men and women . All five Philistine kings were there . There were about three thousand men and women on the roof , watching Samson entertain them .
Samson prayed : » Sovereign Lord Jehovah please remember me . Please , God , give me my strength just this one time . With this one blow I can get even with the Philistines for putting out my two eyes . «
Then Samson took hold of the two middle columns holding up the building . He put one hand on each column . He pushed against them .
Samson shouted : » Let me die with the Philistines ! « He pushed with all his might , and the building fell down on the five kings and everyone else . Samson killed more people at his death than he had killed during his life .
His brothers and the rest of his family came to get his body . They took him back and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of his father Manoah . He had been Israel’s judge for twenty years .
There was a man named Micah , who lived in the mountains of Ephraim .
He said to his mother : » When someone stole those eleven hundred pieces of silver from you , you put a curse on the robber . I heard you do it . Look , I have the money . I am the one who took it . « His mother said : » Jehovah blesses you . «
He gave the money back to his mother . She said : » To keep the curse from falling on my son , I myself solemnly dedicate the silver to Jehovah . It will be used to make a wooden idol covered with silver . Now I will give the pieces of silver back to you . «
He returned them to his mother . She took two hundred of the pieces of silver and gave them to a metalworker . The metalworker made an idol , carving it from wood and covering it with the silver . It was placed in Micah’s house .
Micah had his own place of worship . He made some idols and an ephod , and appointed one of his sons as his priest .
In those days there was no king in Israel . Everyone did whatever he or she wanted to do .
There was a young Levite who had been living in the town of Bethlehem in Judah .
The man left Bethlehem to find another place to live . While he was traveling , he came to Micah’s house in the mountains of Ephraim .
Micah asked him : » Where do you come from ? « He answered : » I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah . I need a place to live . «
Micah said : » Stay here with me . Be my adviser and priest . I will give you ten pieces of silver a year along with some clothes , and your food . «
The young Levite agreed to stay with Micah . He became like a son to him .
He lived in Micah’s home . Micah made him his priest .
Micah said : » Now I know that Jehovah will be good to me , since I have a Levite as a priest . «
There was no king in Israel in those days . The tribe of Dan was looking for territory to claim and settle in because they had not yet received any land of their own among the tribes of Israel .
The people of Dan sent five qualified men out of all the families in the tribe from the towns of Zorah and Eshtaol with instructions to explore the land and spy on it . When they arrived in the mountains of Ephraim , they stayed at Micah’s house .
While they were at Micah’s house , they recognized the accent of the young Levite , so they went up to him and asked : What are you doing here ? Who brought you here ?
He answered : » Micah and I have an arrangement . He pays me to serve as his priest . «
They said to him : » Please ask God if our journey will be successful . «
The priest answered : » Do not worry . Jehovah is taking care of you on this trip . «
So the five men left and traveled to the town of Laish . They saw how the people there lived in security like the Sidonians . They were a peaceful , quiet people , with no argument with anyone . They had all they needed . They lived far away from the Sidonians and had nothing to do with any other people .
When the five men returned to Zorah and Eshtaol , the people asked them what they found .
They said : » Come and attack Laish . We saw the land , and it is very good . Do not stay here doing nothing . Enter and possess the land .
» When you go you will find a secure people who do not suspect a thing . It is a big country . God has given it to you and it has all you could want . «
Six hundred men from the tribe of Dan left Zorah and Eshtaol , ready for war .
They went up and camped west of Kiriath Jearim in Judah . That is why the place is still called Camp of Dan .
They went from there to Micah’s house in the mountains of Ephraim .
The five men who had gone to spy on the country around Laish said to their companions : » Did you know that here in one of these houses there is a wooden idol covered with silver ? There are also other idols and an ephod . Consider what you should do . «
They went into Micah’s house , where the young Levite lived . They greeted the Levite .
The six hundred soldiers from the tribe of Dan , ready for battle , stood at the gate .
The five spies went straight into the house . They took the wooden idol covered with silver , the other idols , and the ephod . The priest stayed at the gate with the six hundred armed men .
The men went into Micah’s house and took the sacred objects . The priest asked them : » What are you doing ? «
They told him : » Be quiet . Do not say a word . Come with us and be our priest and adviser . Is it better for you to be a priest to the house of one man , or to be a priest to a tribe and a family in Israel ? «
This filled the priest with joy . He took the sacred objects and went along with them .
They turned around and started off , with their children , their livestock , and their belongings going ahead .
They traveled a good way from the house when Micah gathered his neighbors for battle . They caught up with the Danites .
They shouted at them . The Danites turned around and asked Micah , » What is the problem ? Why have you gathered such a company ? «
Micah answered : » What do you mean ? You take my priest and the gods that I made , and walk off ! What do I have left ? «
The Danites responded : » Do not say anymore or these men will get angry and attack you . You and your whole family would die . «
The Danites went on their way . Micah saw that they were too strong for him , so he went back home .
They took the things Micah made and the priest who belonged to him and attacked Laish . Laish was a town of peaceful , quiet people in the same valley as Bethrehob . They killed the inhabitants and burned the town .
There was no one to save them , because Laish was a long way from Sidon , and they had no dealings with any other people . The Danites rebuilt the town and settled down there .
They changed its name from Laish to Dan , after their ancestor Dan , the son of Jacob .
The Danites set up the idol to be worshiped , and Jonathan , the son of Gershom and grandson of Moses , served as a priest for the Danites . His descendants served as their priests until the people were taken away into exile .
Micah’s idol remained there as long as the Tent where God was worshiped was at Shiloh .
There was still no king in Israel . There was a Levite who lived in the remote area of Mount Ephraim . He took for himself a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah .
She was unfaithful to him and went to her father’s house at Bethlehem in Judah . She was there four whole months .
The man went after her to persuade her to return . He took his servant and two donkeys with him . The woman invited the Levite into the house , and when her father saw him , he gave him a friendly greeting .
The young woman’s father insisted that he stay . So he stayed for three days . The couple had their meals and spent the nights there .
The morning of the fourth day they woke up early and prepared to go . But the woman’s father said to the Levite : Eat first . You will feel better . You can go later .
The two men sat down and ate and drank together . Then the woman’s father told him : » Spend the night and enjoy yourself . «
The Levite got up to go . However the father encouraged him to stay , so he spent another night there .
The morning of the fifth day he started to leave . The woman’s father said : » Eat something and wait until later in the day . « The two men ate together .
When the man , his concubine , and the servant once more started to leave , the father said : » It is almost evening . Please spend the night . It will be dark soon . Stay and enjoy yourself . Tomorrow you can get up early for the trip and go home . «
The man did not want to spend another night there . He and his concubine started on their way , with their servant and two donkeys with packsaddles .
It was late in the day when they came near Jebus that is , Jerusalem . The servant said to his master : » Why not stop and spend the night here in this Jebusite city ? «
But his master said : » We are not going to stop in a city where the people are not Israelites .
» We will pass by and go a little farther and spend the night at Gibeah or Ramah . «
They passed by Jebus and continued on their way . It was sunset when they came to Gibeah in the territory of the tribe of Benjamin .
They turned off the road to spend the night there . They went into town and sat down in the city square . However no one offered to take them home for the night .
An old man came by at the end of a day’s work on the farm . He was originally from the mountains of Ephraim , but he was now living in Gibeah . The other people there were from the tribe of Benjamin .
The old man saw the traveler in the city square and asked : » Where do you come from ? Where are you going ? «
The Levite answered : » We have been in Bethlehem in Judah . We are on our way home deep in the mountains of Ephraim . No one will put us up for the night .
» We have fodder and straw for our donkeys and we have bread and wine for my concubine and me and for my servant . We have everything we need . «
The old man said : » Come to my home . You are welcome ! I will take care of you . You do not have to spend the night in the square . «
He took them home and fed their donkeys . They washed their feet and ate and drank .
They were enjoying themselves when suddenly some sexual perverts from the town surrounded the house and pounded on the door . They said to the old man : Bring out the man who came to your house ! We want to have sex with him !
The old man went outside and said to them : » No , my friends ! Please ! Do not do such an evil , immoral thing ! This man is my guest .
» Here is his concubine and my virgin daughter . I will bring them out now . You can have them . Do whatever you want with them . But do not do such an awful thing to this man ! «
The men would not listen to him . The Levite took his concubine and put her outside with them . They raped her and abused her all night long and did not stop until morning .
At dawn the woman came and fell down at the door of the old man’s house . She was still there when daylight came .
When her master opened the door that morning to go on his way , he found his concubine lying in front of the house with her hands reaching for the door .
He said : » Get up and let us go . « But there was no answer . Then he put her body across the donkey and started on his way home .
When he arrived at his house he got a knife . He took his concubine’s body and cut it into twelve pieces . He sent one piece to each of the twelve tribes of Israel .
Everyone who saw it said : » No such deed has been seen or done since the people of Israel left Egypt ! We must do something about this ! What will we do ? «
The people of Israel came from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south , as well as from the land of Gilead in the east . They were united in Jehovah’s presence at Mizpah .
The leaders of all the tribes of Israel were present at this gathering of God’s people . There were four hundred thousand foot soldiers .
Now the people of Benjamin heard that all the other Israelites had gathered at Mizpah . The Israelites asked : » Tell us , how did this wicked deed happen ? «
» The Levite whose concubine had been murdered answered : » My concubine and I went to Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin to spend the night .
» The men of Gibeah came to get me . They surrounded the house at night . They intended to kill me . Instead they raped my concubine , and she died .
» I took her body and cut it in pieces . Then I sent one piece to each of the twelve tribes of Israel for these people have committed an evil and immoral act .
» What are you Israelites going to do about this ? «
The people stood together and said : » None of us , whether he lives in a tent or in a house , will go home .
» This is what we will do : We will draw lots and choose some men to attack Gibeah .
» One tenth of the men in Israel will provide food for the army . The others will go and punish Gibeah for this immoral act they committed in Israel . «
The men of Israel assembled with one purpose , to attack the town .
The tribes of Israel sent messengers through the territory of the tribe of Benjamin to say : » What is this crime that you have committed ?
» Hand over those perverts in Gibeah , so that we can kill them and remove this evil from Israel . « But the people of Benjamin would not listen to their brothers .
People from all the cities of Benjamin came to Gibeah to fight the other people of Israel .
They mobilized twenty-six thousand soldiers from their cities that day .
Besides these , the citizens of Gibeah gathered seven hundred specially chosen men who were left-handed . Every one of them could sling a stone at a strand of hair and never miss .
Not including the tribe of Benjamin , the well-trained soldiers of Israel numbered four hundred thousand .
The Israelites went to the house of God at Bethel , and there they asked God : » Which of us should attack the Benjaminites first ? « Jehovah answered : » The tribe of Judah . «
So the Israelites started out the next morning and camped near the city of Gibeah .
They went to attack the army of Benjamin , and placed the soldiers in battle array to fight against Gibeah .
The army of Benjamin came out of the city . That day they killed twenty-two thousand Israelite soldiers .
The Israelite army was encouraged as they placed the soldiers in position again at the place where they put themselves the first day .
They mourned in the presence of Jehovah until evening . They asked him if they should go again in battle against their brothers the Benjaminites ? Jehovah’s answer was : » Yes . «
The Israelites marched against the army of Benjamin a second time .
The second time the Benjaminites came out of Gibeah . This time they killed eighteen thousand trained Israelite soldiers .
The people of Israel went up to Bethel and mourned . They sat there in Jehovah’s presence and fasted until evening . They offered fellowship sacrifices and burned some sacrifices whole in the presence of Jehovah .
The Ark of the Covenant was there at Bethel in those days . Phinehas , the son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron , was in charge of it .
The people asked Jehovah : » Should we go to battle against our brothers the Benjaminites again , or should we cease ? « Jehovah answered : » Fight . Tomorrow I will give you victory over them . «
The Israelites hid some soldiers around Gibeah .
Then for the third straight day they marched against the army of Benjamin . They placed their soldiers in battle position facing Gibeah , as they had done before .
The Benjaminites came out to fight and were drawn away from the city . Just as before they killed some Israelites in the open country , on the road to Bethel and on the road to Gibeah . They killed about thirty Israelites .
The Benjaminites said : » They are defeated just as before . But the Israelites planned to retreat and lead them away from the city onto the roads . «
The main army of the Israelites pulled back and regrouped at Baaltamar . The men surrounding Gibeah suddenly rushed out of hiding in the rocky country around the city .
Ten thousand , specially chosen men , out of all Israel , attacked Gibeah , and the fighting was fierce . The Benjaminites did not realize they were about to be destroyed .
Jehovah gave Israel victory over the army of Benjamin . The Israelites killed twenty five thousand one hundred of the enemy that day ,
The Benjaminites knew they were defeated . The main body of the Israelite army had retreated from the Benjaminites . This is because they relied on the men that were hiding around Gibeah .
These men ran quickly toward Gibeah . They spread out and killed everyone there .
The main Israelite army and the men in hiding had a prearranged signal . When they saw a big cloud of smoke going up from the town ,
the Israelites out on the battlefield were to turn around . By this time the Benjaminites had already killed the thirty Israelites . They told themselves : » We have beaten them . «
The signal appeared . A cloud of smoke rose above the town . The Benjaminites looked behind them to see the whole city going up in flames .
Then the Israelites turned around . The Benjaminites were thrown into panic because they could see that they were about to be destroyed .
They retreated from the Israelites . They ran toward the open country and could not escape . They were caught between the main army and the men now coming out of the city . They were destroyed .
The Israelites trapped the enemy . Without stopping they pursued them as far as a point east of Gibeah . They killed them as they advanced .
Eighteen thousand of the best Benjaminite soldiers were killed .
The others turned and ran to the open country to Rimmon Rock . Five thousand of them were killed on the roads . The Israelites continued to pursue the rest to Gidom , killing two thousand .
In all , twenty-five thousand brave Benjaminites were killed that day .
Six hundred men were able to escape to the open country to Rimmon Rock . They stayed there four months .
The Israelites turned back against the rest of the Benjaminites and killed them all , men and women , children and animals as well . They burned every town in the area .
The Israelites gathered at Mizpah . They made a solemn promise to Jehovah : » None of us will allow a daughter to marry a Benjaminite . «
The people of Israel went to Bethel and sat there in the presence of God until evening . They lifted their voices and wept bitterly .
They said : » Jehovah God of Israel , why has this happened ? Why is the tribe of Benjamin about to disappear from Israel ? «
The next morning the people got up early and built an altar there . They offered burnt offerings and peace offerings .
They asked : » Is there any group out of all the tribes of Israel that did not go to the gathering in Jehovah’s presence at Mizpah ? « They had taken a solemn oath that anyone who had not gone to Mizpah would be put to death .
The people of Israel felt sorry for their brothers the Benjaminites . They said : » Israel has lost one of its tribes .
» We have made a solemn promise to Jehovah that we will not give them any of our daughters . How can we make sure that the remaining men of Benjamin will have wives ? «
When they asked if some group out of the tribes of Israel had not gone to the gathering at Mizpah , they found out that no one from Jabesh in Gilead had been there .
No one from Jabesh responded to the roll call .
The assembly sent twelve thousand of their bravest men with the orders : Go kill everyone in Jabesh , including women and children .
Kill all the males , and also every woman who is not a virgin .
They found four hundred young virgins among the people in Jabesh . They brought them to the camp at Shiloh , which is in the land of Canaan .
The whole assembly sent word to the Benjaminites who were at Rimmon Rock and offered to end the war .
The Benjaminites came back . And the other Israelites gave them the young women from Jabesh whom they had not killed . But there were not enough of them .
The people felt sorry for the Benjaminites because Jehovah had broken the unity of the tribes of Israel .
So the leaders said : » There are no more women in the tribe of Benjamin . What shall we do to provide wives for the men who are left ?
» Israel must not lose one of its twelve tribes . We must find a way for the tribe of Benjamin to survive .
» We cannot allow them to marry our daughters . We have put a curse on anyone who allows a Benjaminite to marry one of our daughters . «
They said : » The yearly festival of Jehovah at Shiloh is coming soon . Shiloh is north of Bethel , south of Lebonah , and east of the road between Bethel and Shechem . «
They told the Benjaminites : » Go hide in the vineyards . «
» When the young women of Shiloh come out to dance during the festival , you come out of the vineyards . Each of you should take a wife by force from among them and take her back to the territory of Benjamin with you .
» If their fathers or brothers come to you and protest , you can tell them : ‘ Please let us keep them , because we did not take them from you in battle to be our wives . Since you did not give them to us , you are not guilty of breaking your promise . ’ «
The Benjaminites did this . Each of them chose a wife from the young women who were dancing at Shiloh and carried her away . They went back to their own territory , rebuilt their towns , and lived there .
The rest of the Israelites left , and every man went back to his own tribe and family and to his own property .
In those days there was no king in Israel . Everyone did what was right in his own eyes .
There was a famine in the land in the days when the judges ruled . And a man of Bethlehem in Judah went to live in the country of Moab , he and his wife and his two sons .
The man was Elimelech , and his wife was Naomi , and the two sons were Mahlon and Chilion , Ephrathites of Bethlehem in Judah . They went to Moab and stayed there .
Naomi’s husband Elimelech died . And she was left with her two sons .
They took two women of Moab as their wives . One was Orpah and the other Ruth . They made their home there for about ten years .
Mahlon and Chilion also died . Naomi was left all alone . She had no husband or sons .
Some time later Naomi heard that Jehovah blessed his people by giving them good crops . So she got ready to leave Moab with her daughters-in-law .
They started out together to go back to Judah .
On the way she said to them : » Go back home and stay with your mothers . Jehovah should be as good to you as you have been to me and to those who have died .
» May Jehovah make it possible for each of you to marry again and have a home . « Then Naomi kissed them good-bye and they cried .
They said to her : » No ! We will go with you to your people . «
» You must go back , my daughters , « Naomi replied . » Why do you want to come with me ? Do you think I could have sons again for you to marry ?
» Return home , my daughters . I am too old to get married again . Even if I thought there was still hope , and got married and had sons ,
» would you wait for them to grow up ? Would this keep you from marrying someone else ? No , my daughters , you know that is not possible . Jehovah has turned against me . I feel sorry for you . «
They started crying again . Orpah kissed her mother-in-law good-bye and went back home . Ruth held on to her .
Naomi said to her : » Ruth , your sister-in-law went back to her people and her gods . Go back home with her .
Ruth replied : » Do not ask me to leave you ! Let me go with you . Wherever you go , I will go ; wherever you live , I will live . Your people will be my people , and your God will be my God .
» Wherever you die , I will die . That is where I will be buried . May Jehovah’s worst punishment come upon me if I let anything but death separate me from you ! «
When she saw that Ruth was determined to go with her , she said no more .
The two of them traveled to Bethlehem . When they arrived at Bethlehem the whole town was excited because of them . The women said : » Is this Naomi ? «
She said : » Do not call me Naomi meaning pleasant . Call me Mara , because the Almighty has made my life bitter .
» I went away full , and Jehovah sent me back empty . Why do you give me the name Naomi , seeing that Jehovah has given witness against me , and the Almighty has brought sorrow to me ? «
So Naomi came back out of the country of Moab . Ruth the Moabitess , her daughter-in-law , came with her . They came to Bethlehem in the first days of the barley harvest .
Boaz was a relative of Naomi . He was a wealthy man from the family of Elimelech .
Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi : » Now let me go into the fields and pick up the heads of grain after anyone in whose eyes I find favor . « She said to her : » Go , my daughter . «
So she went and picked up the heads of grain in the field after the cutters . By chance she went into that part of the field owned by Boaz , who was of the family of Elimelech .
Boaz came from Bethlehem . He said to the grain-cutters , » Jehovah is with you . « They answered : » Jehovah gives you his blessing . «
Boaz asked his servant who was in authority over the cutters : » Whose young woman is this ? «
The servant said : » It is a Moabite girl who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab . «
She said to me : » Let me come into the grain-field and pick up the grain after the cutters . « So she came , and has been here from morning till now , without resting even for a minute .
Then Boaz said to Ruth : » Listen to me , my daughter ; do not go to pick up the grain in another field . Do not leave here , but stay with my servant girls .
» Keep your eyes on the field the men are harvesting and follow with the girls . I told the men not to touch you . When you are thirsty , drink from the water jars the men keep filled . «
Then she bowed down on her face to the earth , and said to him : » Why have I found favor in your eyes ? For you give me attention and I am a foreigner . «
Boaz answered : » I have heard about everything you have done for your mother-in-law after the death of your husband . You went away from your father and mother and the land of your birth , and came to a people who are strange to you .
» May Jehovah reward you for what you have done . May you have a full reward from Jehovah the God of Israel , to whom you have come for protection ! «
Ruth answered : » You are very kind to me , sir . You make me feel better by speaking gently to me , even though I do not even have the standing of one of your servants . «
At mealtime Boaz said to her : » Come here , that you may eat of the bread and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar . « So she sat beside the reapers . He served her roasted grain . She ate and was satisfied and had some left over .
She rose to glean . Boaz commanded his servants , saying : » Let her glean among the sheaves , and do not bother her .
» Pull some heads of grain out of what has been corded up and drop them for her to take . Say no sharp word to her . «
She gathered the heads of grain till evening . After crushing out the seed , it came to about an ephah of grain .
She carried it back to town to show her mother-in-law what she gathered . She kept enough for herself and gave Naomi the rest .
Her mother-in-law said to her : » Where did you gather grain today ? Where did you work ? Blessed is the man who gave you this attention . « So she gave her mother-in-law an account of where she had been working , and said : » The name of the man with whom I was working today is Boaz . «
Naomi said to her daughter-in-law : » May Jehovah bless him . The man is kind to the living and to the dead . « Then Naomi admitted to her : » The man is of our family , one of our near relatives . «
Ruth the Moabitess said : » Truly , he said to me : ‘ Keep near my young men till all my grain is cut . ’ «
And Naomi said to Ruth , her daughter-in-law : » It is better , my daughter , for you to go out with his servant girls , so that no danger may come to you in another field . «
So she kept near the servant girls of Boaz to gather the grain till the cutting of the early grain and the cutting of the late grain was ended . She continued living with her mother-in-law .
Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her : » My daughter , Should I try to find a secure home for you where you will be well treated ?
» Boaz is of our kindred , with whose servant girls you have been . He winnows barley tonight in the threshing floor .
» Wash and perfume yourself and put on your best clothes . Go down to the floor . Make yourself known to the man after he is done eating and drinking .
» When he lies down , notice the place where he lies down . Go in , uncover his feet and lay down . He will tell you what you should do . «
Ruth said : » All that you say to me I will do . «
She went down to the floor , and did according to all that her mother-in-law told her .
After Boaz ate and drank , and his heart was merry , he went to lie down at the end of the heap of barley . Ruth approached quietly , uncovered his feet , and lay down .
Something startled him about midnight . He saw the woman at his feet .
He said : » Who are you ? « She answered : » I am your servant Ruth . Spread your garment over me , for you are my kinsman . «
He said : » You are blessed of Jehovah , my daughter : for this kindness is greater than what you showed earlier . You have not pursued younger men , whether poor or rich .
» And now , my daughter , have no fear . I will do for you whatever you say , for it is clear to all my townspeople that you are a woman of virtue .
» It is true that I am a close relative , but there is a relation nearer than I .
» Rest here tonight . In the morning , if he wants to redeem you , for it is right for a relation to do this , very well , let him do so . But if he will not , then as surely as Jehovah lives , I will do so . «
She slept there at his feet until morning . She got up before it was light enough for anyone to see . He said : » Do not let anyone know that a woman came to the grain floor . «
He said : » Take your robe and stretch it out in your hands . « She did so , and he took six measures of grain and put them into it . Then she went back to town .
When she got back , her mother-in-law asked her : » How did it go with you , my daughter ? « And she gave her an account of all that the man did to her .
She said : » He gave me these six measures of grain , saying , ‘ Do not go back to your mother-in-law with nothing in your hands . ’ «
Naomi said : » Wait until you find out what happened . The man will not rest till he sees this thing through . «
Boaz went to the public place in the town and sat down . When the kinsman-redeemer came along , the one he had mentioned , Boaz said : » Come here , and sit down . « He came and was seated .
Then he got ten of the responsible men of the town , and said : » Be seated here . And they took their seats . «
Then Boaz said to the close relative : » Naomi has come back from the country of Moab . She is offering for a price that bit of land which belonged to our brother Elimelech .
» I am giving you a chance to take it with the approval of those seated here , the responsible men of my people . If you are ready to do what it is right for a relative to do , then do it . If you will not do it , say so to me now . There is no one who has the right to do it but you , and after you , myself . « And he said : » I will do it . «
Then Boaz said : » On the day when you take this field , you will have to take with it Ruth , the Moabitess , the wife of the dead , so that you may keep the name of the dead living in his heritage . «
The near relative said : » I am not able to redeem it for myself , for fear of damaging the heritage I have . You may do it in my place , for I am not able to do it myself . «
It was the custom for the seller to take off his sandal and give to the buyer to settle a sale or exchange of property . By doing this , Israelites showed that the matter was settled .
So when the man said to Boaz : » You buy it , « he took off his sandal and gave it to Boaz .
Then Boaz said to the leaders and all the others there : » You are all witnesses today that I have bought from Naomi everything that belonged to Elimelech and to his sons Chilion and Mahlon .
» In addition , Ruth the Moabite , Mahlon’s widow , becomes my wife . This will keep the property in the dead man’s family , and his family line will continue among his people in his hometown . Today you are witnesses to this . «
The leaders and the others said : » Yes , we are witnesses . May Jehovah make your wife become like Rachel and Leah , who bore many children to Jacob . May you become rich in the clan of Ephrathah and famous in Bethlehem .
» May your family be like the family of Perez , the son whom Tamar gave to Judah , from the offspring that Jehovah may give you by this young woman . «
Boaz took Ruth to be his wife . He slept with her and Jehovah enabled her to conceive and she gave birth to a son .
The women said to Naomi : » A blessing on Jehovah . He has not let you be without a near relative . May his name be great in Israel .
» He will be a giver of new life to you . He will be your comforter when you are old , because your daughter-in-law , who in her love for you is better than seven sons , has given birth to him . «
Naomi took the child in her arms and took care of it .
Her neighbor women gave it a name . They said : » Naomi has a child . « They gave him the name of Obed : he is the father of Jesse , the father of David .
Now these are the generations of Perez : Perez became the father of Hezron .
And Hezron became the father of Ram , and Ram became the father of Amminadab .
And Amminadab became the father of Nahshon , and Nahshon became the father of Salmon .
Salmon became the father of Boaz , and Boaz became the father of Obed .
And Obed became the father of Jesse , and Jesse became the father of David .
There was a certain man of Ramathaim , a Zuphite of the mountains of Ephraim . His name was Elkanah . He was the son of Jeroham son of Elihu son of Tohu son of Zuph an Ephraimite .
He had two wives , one named Hannah and the other Peninnah . Peninnah was the mother of children . Hannah had no children .
This man went to Shiloh every year to worship and to make offerings to Jehovah of Hosts . The two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas were the priests of Jehovah at Shiloh .
The day came for Elkanah to make his offering . So he gave a part of the feast to Peninnah his wife , and to all her sons and daughters .
He gave a double portion to Hannah . Hannah was very dear to him even though Jehovah had not given her children .
The other wife did everything possible to make her unhappy . This is because Jehovah had not given her children .
Year after year when Peninnah went to the Temple of Jehovah , she kept on provoking Hannah . It bothered Hannah so much she wept and did not eat .
Her husband Elkanah said to her : » Hannah , why are you weeping ? Why are you not eating ? Why is your heart troubled ? Am I not more to you than ten sons ? «
So after they finished eating and drinking in Shiloh Hannah got up . The priest Eli sat by the pillars near the door in the Temple of Jehovah .
Hannah was filled with grief and wept bitterly . She prayed and pledged an oath to Jehovah :
» O Jehovah of Hosts : If you will truly notice the sorrow of your servant . Remember me . Do not turn away from me . If you will give me a son , then I will give him to you , Jehovah , all the days of his life . His hair will never be cut . «
Hannah prayed to Jehovah for a long time . Eli watched her lips .
She prayed silently . Her lips were moving , but she made no sound . So Eli thought that she was drunk .
He said to her : » Stop making a drunken show of yourself ! Stop your drinking and sober up ! «
» No , I am not drunk , « she answered . » I have not been drinking ! I am desperate . I have prayed and poured out my troubles to Jehovah .
» Do not consider your maidservant a worthless woman . I pray like this because I am miserable and filled with grief . «
Eli answered : » Go in peace . May the God of Israel give you what you have asked of him . «
» Let your maidservant find favor in your sight , « she replied . Then she went away , ate some food , and was no longer sad self-concerned .
The next morning Elkanah and his family got up early . After worshiping Jehovah , they went back home to Ramah . Elkanah had intercourse with his wife Hannah and Jehovah answered her prayer .
So it was that she became pregnant and gave birth to a son . She named him Samuel . She explained : » I asked Jehovah for him . «
The time came again for Elkanah and his family to go to Shiloh and offer to Jehovah the yearly sacrifice and the special sacrifice he promised .
This time Hannah did not go . She told her husband : As soon as the child is weaned , I will take him to the Temple of Jehovah , where he will stay all his life .
Elkanah answered : » All right , do what seems best to you . Stay at home until you have weaned him . May Jehovah make your promise come true . « So Hannah stayed at home and nursed her child .
After she weaned him she took him to Shiloh . She also took a three-year-old bull , a bushel of flour , and a leather bag full of wine . She took Samuel , young as he was , to the Temple of Jehovah at Shiloh .
First they slaughtered the bull . Then they took the child to Eli the priest .
Hannah said to him : » My lord . Do you remember me ? I am the woman you saw standing here , praying to Jehovah .
» I asked him for this child . He gave me what I asked of him .
» So I am dedicating giving granting him to Jehovah . As long as he lives , he will belong to Jehovah . « Then they worshiped Jehovah there .
Hannah prayed : » My heart rejoices in Jehovah . My horn strength power is exalted in Jehovah . I speak against mock my enemies because I rejoice in your salvation .
» No one is as holy as Jehovah . There is none beside you . Neither is there any rock like our God .
» Boast no more so proudly . Remove arrogance from your mouth . Jehovah is a God of knowledge , and he measures his actions deeds .
» The bows of the mighty are broken . Those who stumbled are girded with strength .
» Those who were full have hired themselves out for food . The hungry have ceased to hunger . The barren has borne seven . She who has had many sons has languished .
» Jehovah kills and makes alive . He brings down to the grave and brings up .
» Jehovah takes away and He gives riches . He brings low and lifts up high .
» He raises the poor from the dust . He lifts up the needy from the dunghill to set them among the princes . He causes them to inherit a throne of glory honor . The pillars of the earth are Jehovah’s . He sets the world on them .
» He guards the feet of his holy ones . The wicked are silenced in darkness . Man will not prevail by strength .
» The adversaries of Jehovah will be broken to pieces . He thunders in the heavens against them . Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth . He will give strength to His king and exalt the horn power of His anointed . «
Elkanah went home to Ramah . The child served Jehovah before Eli the priest .
The sons of Eli were corrupt . They did not know Jehovah .
The priests had a custom with the people . If any man offered sacrifice , the priest’s servant came while the flesh was boiling , with a fork of three teeth in his hand .
He stuck it into the pan , kettle , caldron or pot . All that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took for himself . So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites that came there .
Before they burned the fat the priest’s servant came and said to the man who sacrificed : » Give flesh to roast for the priest . For he will not have boiled flesh from you , but raw ! «
If any man said to him : » Let them burn the fat first , you may take as much as you desire . « Then he would answer him , » No ! But you will give it now ! If not , I will take it by force . «
The sin of the young men was very great before Jehovah . For men despised the offering of Jehovah .
Samuel served before Jehovah as a child girded with a linen ephod .
His mother made him a little robe . She brought it to him when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice .
Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife , and said : » May Jehovah give you children from this woman for the loan made to Jehovah . « They returned to their home .
Jehovah visited Hannah so that she conceived . She bore three sons and two daughters . At the same time the child Samuel grew before Jehovah .
Eli was very old . He heard everything his sons did to Israel . He heard how they slept with the women who served at the door of the tabernacle of meeting .
So he said to them : » Why do you do such things ? I hear of your evil dealings by all the people .
» No , my sons . It is not a good report that I hear . You make Jehovah’s people transgress .
» If one man sins against another , God will judge him . But if a man sins against Jehovah , who will intercede for him ? « But his sons did not listen to the voice of their father . Jehovah desired to put them to death .
The child Samuel grew both in stature and in goodness with Jehovah and also with men .
A man of God came to Eli . He said : » Thus says Jehovah : ‘ Did I plainly appear to the house of your father when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh’s house ?
» ‘ Did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest , to offer upon my altar , to burn incense , to wear an ephod in my presences me ? Did I give to the house of your father all the offerings made by fire from the sons of Israel ?
» ‘ Why do you kick at my sacrifice and my offering , which I have commanded in my house ? Do you honor your sons above me , to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel my people ? ’
» Jehovah , the God of Israel says : ‘ I said indeed that your house and the house of your father should walk before me all the days of your life . ’ « Now Jehovah says : » Far be it from me . I will honor those who honor me . I will not regard those who think little of me .
» ‘ The days are coming when I will cut off your arm reduce your strength and the arm of your father’s house . No old man shall be in your house !
» ‘ You will see the enemy in my house even though God does good for Israel . There will not be an old man in your house forever .
» ‘ Yet I will keep one of your descendants alive . He will serve me as priest . But he will become blind and lose all hope . All your other descendants will die in the prime of life .
» ‘ Your two sons Hophni and Phinehas will both die on the same day . This will show you a sign that everything I have said will come true .
» ‘ I will choose a priest who will be faithful to me and do everything I desire him to do . I will give him descendants , who will always serve in the presence of my anointed ones forever .
» ‘ Your descendants who survive will have to go to that priest and ask him for money and food , and beg to be allowed to help the priests , in order to have something to eat . ’ «
When the boy Samuel was serving Jehovah under the direction of Eli , there were very few messages from Jehovah . Visions from him were rare .
Eli was lying down in his usual place . His eyes became dim and he could not see .
The lamp of God went out in the Temple of Jehovah . Samuel was lying down where the Ark of God was .
Jehovah called Samuel . He answered : » Here am I . «
He ran to Eli and said : » Here I am . You called me ? « » I did not call you , « Eli replied . » Go back to bed . « So Samuel went back to bed .
Jehovah called Samuel again . Samuel got up , went to Eli , and said : » Here I am . You called me . « Eli responded : » I did not call you , son . Go back to bed . «
Samuel had no experience with Jehovah , because the word of Jehovah had not yet been revealed to him .
Jehovah called Samuel a third time . Samuel got up , went to Eli , and said : » Here I am . You called me ! « Eli realized discerned that Jehovah was calling the boy .
» Go , lie down , « Eli told Samuel . When he calls you , say : » Speak Jehovah I am listening . « So Samuel went back to bed in his room .
Jehovah came and stood there . He called as he had called the other times : » Samuel ! Samuel ! « Samuel replied : » Speak ! Your servant is listening . «
Jehovah said to Samuel : » I will do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears it tingle .
» On that day I am going to do to Eli and his family everything I said from beginning to end .
» I told him I would hand down a long lasting judgment against his household because he knew about his sons’ sin . They were cursing God but he did not restrain them .
» I have taken an oath concerning Eli’s family line . No offering or sacrifice will ever be able to make peace for the sins that Eli’s family committed . «
Samuel remained in bed until morning . Then he opened the doors of Jehovah’s house . But Samuel was afraid to tell Eli about the vision .
Eli called Samuel and said : » Samuel , my son . « » Here I am , « he responded .
» What did Jehovah tell you ? « He asked . » Please do not hide it from me . May God strike you dead if you hide anything he told you from me . «
Then Samuel told Eli everything . Eli replied : » He is Jehovah ! He will do what he thinks is right . «
Samuel grew up . Jehovah was with him and did not let any of his words go unfulfilled fail .
All Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew Samuel was Jehovah’s appointed prophet .
Jehovah continued to appear in Shiloh , since Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh through the word of Jehovah . And Samuel spoke to all Israel .
Samuels words came to all Israel . Israel went out to battle against the Philistines . They camped near Ebenezer while the Philistines camped at Aphek .
The Philistines deployed their troops to meet Israel in battle . The Philistines defeated Israel and killed about four thousand soldiers in the field .
The army of Israel retreated to their camp . The leaders of Israel asked : » Why has Jehovah used the Philistines to defeat us today ? Let us get the Ark of Jehovah’s Covenant from Shiloh so that he may be with us and save us from our enemies . «
They sent men to Shiloh to bring back the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah of Hosts who is enthroned over the angels . Eli’s two sons , Hophni and Phinehas came along with God’s ark .
When Jehovah’s Ark came into the camp , all Israel shouted so loudly that the earth shook .
When the Philistines heard the noise , they asked : » What is all this shouting in the Hebrew camp ? « The Philistines found out that Jehovah’s ark was brought into the camp .
Then they were frightened and said : » A god has come into their camp . « They also said : » Oh no ! Nothing like this has ever happened before .
» We are in trouble now ! Who will deliver us from the power of these mighty gods ? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with plagues in the desert wilderness .
» Be strong , Philistines , and conduct your selves like men with courage . Or else you will serve the Hebrews as they served you . Act like men and fight . «
The Philistines fought and defeated Israel . Every Israelite soldier fled to his tent . It was a major defeat in which thirty thousand Israelite foot soldiers died .
The Ark of the Covenant was captured . Eli’s two sons , Hophni and Phinehas , died .
A man from the tribe of Benjamin ran all the way from the battlefield to Shiloh and arrived there the same day . To show his grief he had torn his clothes and put dirt on his head .
Eli was very worried about the Ark of the Covenant . He sat besides the road staring . When the man spread the news throughout the town everyone cried out in fear .
Eli heard the noise and asked : » What is all this noise about ? « The man hurried to Eli to tell him the news .
Eli was now ninety-eight years old and almost completely blind .
The man said : » I have escaped from the battle and ran all the way here today . « Eli asked him : » What happened , my son ? «
The messenger answered : » Israel ran away from the Philistines . It was a great slaughter and a terrible defeat for us ! Besides that , your sons Hophni and Phinehas were killed , and God’s Ark of the Covenant was captured ! «
When the man mentioned the Ark of God Eli fell backward from his seat beside the gate . He was so old and fat that the fall broke his neck and he died . He was a leader in Israel for forty years .
Eli’s daughter-in-law the wife of Phinehas was pregnant . It was almost time for her baby to be born . When she heard that God’s Ark of the Covenant was captured and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead , she suddenly went into labor and gave birth .
She too was dying . The women helping her said : » Do not be afraid . You have given birth to a son . « But she did not answer or pay attention .
She called the boy Ichabod No Glory , saying : » Israel’s glory is gone , because the Ark of God had been captured and because her father-in-law and her husband died . «
» Israel’s glory is gone because the Ark of God has been captured : « she said .
The Philistines captured the Ark of God and they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod .
They brought it into the temple of Dagon and placed it beside Dagon .
Early the next day the people of Ashdod saw that Dagon had fallen forward on the ground in front of Jehovah’s Ark . So they took Dagon and put him back in his place .
But the next morning they saw that Dagon had again fallen forward on the ground in front of Jehovah’s Ark . Dagon’s head and his two hands were cut off and were lying on the temple’s threshold . The rest of Dagon’s body was intact .
That is why the priests of Dagon and everyone else who enters Dagon’s temple in Ashdod do not step on the temple’s threshold , even to this day .
Jehovah dealt harshly with the people of Ashdod . He destroyed them by striking the people in the vicinity of Ashdod with tumors .
When the people of Ashdod realized what was happening , they said : » The Ark of the God of Israel must not stay with us . Their God is dealing harshly with our god Dagon and with us . «
The people of Ashdod called together the Philistine rulers . » What shall we do with the Ark of the God of Israel ? « They asked . The rulers said : » The Ark of the God of Israel must be taken to Gath . « So the people took the Ark of the God of Israel there .
After they had moved it , Jehovah threw the city into a great panic . He struck all the people in the city and they were covered with tumors .
So the people of Gath sent the Ark of God to Ekron . But when the Ark of God came to Ekron , the people of Ekron cried out : » They brought the Ark of the God of Israel here to kill us . «
The people of Ekron called for another meeting of the Philistine rulers and told them : » Send this chest back where it belongs . Then it will not kill us . « Everyone was in a panic , because God was causing a lot of people to die .
The survivors suffered from the sores , so they all cried to their gods for help .
After the Ark of Jehovah had been in Philistia for seven months ,
the Philistines called in their priests and fortunetellers , and asked : » What should we do with this Ark of Jehovah ? Tell us how to send it back where it belongs ! «
They answered : » If you return the Ark of the Covenant of the God of Israel , you must send with it a gift guilt offering to him to pay for your sin . The Ark must not go back without a gift . In this way you will be healed . You will find out why he continues to punish you . «
» What guilt offering trespass gift shall we send him ? « The people asked . They answered : » Five gold models of tumors and five gold mice , one of each for each Philistine king . The same plague was sent on all of you and on the five kings .
» You must make these models of the tumors and of the mice that are ravaging your country . You must give honor to the God of Israel . Perhaps he will stop punishing you , your gods , and your land .
» Why are you as stubborn as the Egyptians and their Pharaoh were ? When he did terrible mighty things among them did he let the Israelites go ?
» Now get a new cart ready for two dairy cows that have never been yoked . Hitch the cows to the cart . Take their calves away and leave them in their stall .
» Take the Ark of Jehovah and put it on the cart . Put the gold objects that you are giving him as a guilt offering in a box beside the Ark . Send the cart on its way .
» Then watch where it goes . If it goes up the road to its own country toward Beth Shemesh , then this disaster is Jehovah’s doing . But if not , we will know it was not his hand that struck us , but what happened to us was an accident . «
The men did this . They took two milk cows and tied them to the cart . They placed their calves in pens at home .
They laid the Ark of Jehovah on the cart , and the box with the mice of gold and the images of their tumors .
The cows went straight ahead to Bethshemesh . They went on the highway lowing as they went . They did not turn aside to the right or to the left . And the lords of the Philistines followed them to the border of Bethshemesh .
The people of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley . They looked up and saw the ark . They rejoiced to see it .
The cart came to the field of Joshua , a Bethshemite , and stood there . There was a great stone . They cut the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to Jehovah .
The Levites removed the cart the Ark of Jehovah and the box that contained the gold objects . They put them on the large rock . The people of Bethshemesh presented burnt offerings and sacrifices to Jehovah that day .
After the five rulers of the Philistines saw this , they went back to Ekron that same day .
The Philistines sent the five gold tumors to Jehovah as a gift guilt offering to pay for their sins . They included one for each of the cities of Ashdod , Gaza , Ashkelon , Gath , and Ekron .
They also sent gold mice , one for each of the cities ruled by the five Philistine kings , both the fortified towns and the villages without walls . The large rock in the field of Joshua of Bethshemesh , on which they placed the Ark of Jehovah’s Covenant , is still there as a witness to what happened .
Some of the men of Bethshemesh looked inside the Ark . Jehovah killed seventy of them . This made the people of Bethshemesh very sad .
They said : » No other God is like Jehovah ! Who can go near him and still live ? We must send the chest away from here . But where can we send it ? «
They sent messengers to tell the people of Kiriath-Jearim : » The Philistines have returned the Ark of Jehovah . Will you take it and keep it there with you ? «
The people of Kiriath Jearim got the Ark and took it to Abinadab’s house on a hill in their town . His son Eleazar took care of it .
It stayed there for twenty years . During this this long period of time everyone in Israel was very sad and begged Jehovah for help .
Samuel told the entire nation of Israel : » If you return to Jehovah with all your hearts you must get rid of the foreign gods you have , including the statues of the goddess Astarte . You must dedicate your lives to Jehovah and serve him only . Then he will rescue you from the Philistines . «
So the Israelites got rid of their idols of Baal and Astarte . They worshiped only Jehovah .
Samuel called all the Israelites to meet at Mizpah . He told them : » I will pray to Jehovah for you there . «
The Israelites gathered at Mizpah . They drew some water , poured it out in front of Jehovah and fasted that day . They confessed : » We have sinned against Jehovah . « So Samuel judged Israel in Mizpah .
The Philistines heard that the Israelites gathered at Mizpah . So the Philistine rulers came to attack Israel . The Israelites heard about the Philistine plan and were afraid of them .
The Israelites said to Samuel : » Do not stop crying to Jehovah our God for us ! Ask him to deliver us from the Philistines ! «
Samuel killed a young lamb and burned it whole as a sacrifice to Jehovah . Then he prayed to Jehovah to help Israel . Jehovah answered his prayer .
While Samuel was offering the burnt sacrifice , the Philistines moved forward to attack . Just then Jehovah thundered from heaven against them . They became completely confused and fled in panic .
The Israelites marched out from Mizpah and pursued the Philistines and drove them back as far as Bethcar . They killed them along the way .
Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen . He said : » Jehovah helped us all the way . « He named it : » Stone of Help . «
The Philistines were defeated . Jehovah prevented them from invading Israel’s territory as long as Samuel lived .
The cities between Ekron and Gath that the Philistines took from Israel were returned to Israel . Israel recovered the territory controlled by these cities from the Philistines . There was also peace between Israel and the Amorites .
Samuel judged Israel as long as he lived .
Every year he went around to Bethel , Gilgal , and Mizpah in order to judge Israel in all those places .
Then he returned home to Ramah where he judged Israel . And in Ramah he built an altar to Jehovah .
When Samuel was old , he appointed his sons judges over Israel .
The name of his firstborn son was Joel . He named his second son Abijah . They were judges in Beersheba .
The sons did not follow their father’s example but turned to dishonest ways of making money . They took bribes and denied people justice .
One day the nation’s elders came to Samuel at Ramah .
They said : » You are an old man . You set a good example for your sons . But they have not followed it . Now we want a king to be our leader like all the other nations . Choose one for us ! «
Samuel was upset to hear the leaders say they wanted a king . So he prayed about it .
Jehovah answered : » Samuel , do everything they want you to do . I am really the one they have rejected as their king .
» Ever since the day I rescued my people from Egypt , they have turned from me to worship idols . Now they are turning away from you .
» Listen to them . But be sure to warn them and tell them about the behavior and rights of a king who rules over them . «
Then Samuel told the people who had asked him for a king everything Jehovah said .
Samuel said : » These are the rights of a king : He will draft your sons and make them serve on his chariots and horses , and make them run ahead of his chariots .
» He will appoint them to be his officers over one thousand or over fifty soldiers . He will have them plow his ground and harvest his crops . He will require them to make weapons and equipment for his chariots .
» He will take your daughters from you and force them to make perfumes , cook , and bake .
» He will take away the best of your fields , vineyards , and olive orchards and give them to his officials .
» He will take a tenth of your grain and wine and give it to his aids and officials .
» He will confiscate your male and female slaves , your best cattle , and your donkeys for his own use .
» He will take a tenth of your flocks . In addition , you will be his servants .
» You will cry out because of the king whom you have chosen for yourselves . Jehovah will not answer you when that day comes . «
But the people refused to listen to Samuel . They said : » We want a king !
» We want to be like other nations , with our own king to rule us and to lead us out to war and to fight our battles . «
Samuel listened to everything they said . Then he repeated it to Jehovah .
Jehovah answered : » Do what they want . Give them a king . « Then Samuel told all the men of Israel to go back home .
There was a wealthy and influential man named Kish . He was from the tribe of Benjamin . He was the son of Abiel and grandson of Zeror . He belonged to the family of Becorath , a part of the clan of Aphiah .
He had a son named Saul . Saul was a handsome young man in the prime of life . Saul was a foot taller than anyone else in Israel and more handsome as well .
Some donkeys belonging to Kish wandered off . He said to Saul : » Take one of the servants with you and look for the donkeys . «
They went through the mountains of Ephraim and the region of Shalishah , but did not find them . They went on through the region of Shaalim , but the donkeys were not there . Then they went through the territory of Benjamin , but still did not find them .
When they came to the territory of Zuph , Saul told his servant who was with him : » Let us go back , or my father will stop worrying about the donkeys and worry about us instead . «
The servant responded : » There’s a man of God in this city , a highly respected man . Everything he says is sure to happen . Let us go there . Maybe he will tell us which way we should go . «
Saul said : » How can we talk to the prophet when I do not have anything to give him ? We do not even have any food left in our sacks . What can we give him ? «
» I have a small piece of silver , « the servant answered . » We can give him that . Then he will tell us where to look for the donkeys . «
Formerly in Israel , when a person went to ask God a question , he would say : » Come ; let’s go to the seer . « This is because a prophet used to be called a seer .
Saul told his servant : » That is a good idea ! Come on let us go . « They went to the city where the man of God was .
Going up the hill to the city they met girls coming out to get water . They asked the girls : » Is the seer here ? «
The girls answered : » He is there ahead of you . Hurry ! He just went into the city today since the people are offering a sacrifice at the worship site .
» As you go into the city , you can find him before he goes to the worship site to eat . The people will not eat until he comes . He blesses the sacrifice . Then those who are invited may eat . You should be able to find him now . «
Saul and his servant went to the city . Samuel was coming toward them as they entered . He was on his way to the worship site .
Jehovah revealed the following message to Samuel before Saul came :
» This time tomorrow I will send you a man from the territory of Benjamin . Anoint him to be ruler of my people Israel . He will save my people from the Philistines . I have seen my people suffering and their cry has reached me . «
Samuel noticed Saul . Jehovah told him : » There is the man I told you about . This man will govern my people . «
Saul approached Samuel inside the gateway . He said : » Please tell me where the seer’s house is . «
Samuel replied : » I ’ m the seer . Go ahead of me to the worship site . You will eat with me today . In the morning I will let you go after I tell you all that is on your mind .
» Do not trouble yourself about the donkeys that were lost three days ago . They have been found . Who will have all that is desirable in Israel ? Will it be you and your father’s family ? «
Saul replied : » I am a man from the tribe of Benjamin . It is the smallest tribe of Israel . My family is the most insignificant of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin . Why are you saying such things to me ? «
Samuel brought Saul and his servant to the banquet hall . They sat down at the head of thirty guests .
Samuel said to the cook : » Bring me the portion of the sacrificial meat that I gave you and told you to set aside . «
The cook picked up the leg and thigh and laid it in front of Saul . Samuel said : This was set apart for you . Eat it . When I invited people to the feast , I set it aside for you . So Saul ate with Samuel that day .
They left the worship site for the city . They spread blankets and Saul slept on the roof .
At dawn Samuel called to Saul on the roof : » Get up ! It is time for me to send you away . « Saul got up , and both he and Samuel went outside .
As they traveled toward the city limits , Samuel told Saul : » Have the servant go ahead of you . « He went ahead . » You stay here , and I will tell you God’s word . «
Samuel took a flask of olive oil and poured it on Saul’s head . He kissed him and said : » Jehovah has anointed you to be ruler of his people Israel . You will rule his people . You will save them from all their enemies . This will be the sign that Jehovah has anointed you to be ruler of his people .
» When you leave me today two men will be at Rachel’s grave on the border of Benjamin at Zelzah . They will tell you : ‘ We have found the donkeys you are looking for . Your father no longer cares about them . Instead he is worried about you . He keeps asking : What can I do to find my son ? ’ «
» You will go from there until you find the oak tree of Tabor . You will see three men going up to God to Bethel . One will have three young goats and another three cakes of bread and another a skin full of wine :
» They will say : ‘ Peace be with you . ’ ’ They will give you two cakes of bread that you should take from them .
» After that you will come to Gibeah , the hill of God , where an armed force of the Philistines is stationed . When you come to the town , you will see a band of prophets coming down from the high place with instruments of music before them . They will be acting like prophets :
» The Spirit of Jehovah will come upon you with power . You will be acting like a prophet with them , and will be changed into a different person .
» When you see these signs be sure to take what is offered to you . For God is with you .
» Go ahead of me to Gilgal . I will come to sacrifice burnt offerings and make fellowship offerings . Wait seven days until I come to tell you what to do . «
When Saul tried to leave Samuel , God changed his mind . That day all these signs happened .
When Saul came to the hill a group of prophets came to meet him . God’s Spirit came over him . He prophesied with them .
All those who knew him before saw how he prophesied with the prophets . They asked one another : » What has happened to the son of Kish ? Is Saul one of the prophets ? «
A man from that place asked : » Who is their father ? « So it became a proverb : » Is Saul one of the prophets ? «
When he finished prophesying he went to the worship site .
Saul’s uncle asked him and his servant : » Where did you go ? « Saul answered : » To look for the donkeys . When we could not find them , we went to Samuel . «
Saul’s uncle said : » Please tell me what Samuel said to you . «
» He assured us the donkeys had been found , « Saul answered his uncle . But Saul did not tell him what Samuel said about his becoming king .
Samuel called the people to come into the presence of Jehovah at Mizpah .
He said to the Israelites : » This is what Jehovah God of Israel says : ‘ I brought Israel out of Egypt and rescued you from the power of the Egyptians and all the kings who were oppressing you .
» ‘ You have rejected your God , who saves you from all your troubles and distresses . You said to him : » No ! Place a king over us . Now then , stand in front of Jehovah by your tribes and family groups . « ’ «
Samuel had all the tribes of Israel come forward . The tribe of Benjamin was chosen .
He had the tribe of Benjamin come forward by families . The family of Matri Matrites was chosen . Then Saul , the son of Kish , was chosen . They looked for him but could not find him .
They asked Jehovah again : » Has he arrived here yet ? « Jehovah answered : » He’s hiding among the baggage . «
They ran and got him from there . He stood among the people and was a head taller than everyone else .
Samuel asked the people : » Do you see whom Jehovah has chosen ? There is no one like him among all the people . « Then all the people shouted : » Long live the king ! «
Samuel explained the laws concerning kingship to the people . He wrote the laws on a scroll , which he placed in front of Jehovah . Then Samuel sent the people back to their homes .
Saul also went home to Gibeah . With him went some soldiers whose hearts God had touched .
Some good-for-nothing people asked : » How can this man save us ? « They despised him and would not bring him presents . He did not respond .
Nahash the Ammonite came up and put his forces in position for attacking Jabesh in Gilead . The men of Jabesh said to Nahash : » Make an agreement with us and we will be your servants . «
Nahash answered : » I will make a treaty with you on one condition . I will put out everyone’s right eye and so bring disgrace on all Israel . «
The elders of Jabesh said : » Give us seven days to send messengers throughout the land of Israel . If no one will help us , then we will surrender to you . «
The messengers arrived at Gibeah where Saul lived . When they told the news , the people started crying in despair .
Just then Saul came from the field from behind some oxen . » Why are these people crying ? « Saul asked . They told him the news about the men of Jabesh .
When he heard this news , God’s Spirit came over him . He became very angry .
Saul took a pair of oxen , cut them in pieces , and sent them by messengers throughout the territory of Israel with the following message : » This is what will be done to the oxen of anyone who does not follow Saul and Samuel into battle . « The people were afraid of Jehovah . They came out united behind Saul .
When Saul counted them at Bezek , there were three hundred thousand troops from Israel and thirty thousand troops from Judah .
They told the messengers : » This is what you are to say to the men of Jabesh in Gilead : ‘ Tomorrow , by the time the sun gets hot , you will be rescued . ’ « When the men of Jabesh received the message , they were overjoyed .
They said to Nahash the Ammonite : » Tomorrow we will surrender to you . You may do to us whatever you think is right . «
The next day Saul arranged the army in three divisions . They came into the Ammonite camp during the morning hours . They continued to defeat the Ammonites until it got hot that day . The survivors were so scattered that no two of them were left together .
The people asked Samuel : » Who said : ‘ Saul should not rule us ? ’ ’ Let us have them , and we will kill them . ’ «
Saul said : » No man is to be put to death today , for today Jehovah has saved Israel . «
Then Samuel said to the people : » Come to Gilgal . Let us make the kingdom strong in the hands of Saul . «
So all the people went to Gilgal . In Gilgal they made Saul king before Jehovah . Peace offerings were offered before Jehovah . Saul and all the men of Israel were glad with great joy .
Samuel said to all Israel : » I listened to everything you said to me and established a king over you .
» Now you have a king as your leader . I am old and gray and my sons are with you . I walked before you served as your leader from childhood until this day .
» Here I am ! Testify against me before Jehovah and before his anointed one . Whose bull have I stolen ? Whose donkey have I taken ? Have I cheated anyone ? Have I oppressed any ? Have I ever taken a bribe ? Tell me and I will make it right . «
The people answered : » You have not cheated us or oppressed us . You have not taken anything from anyone . «
Samuel replied : » Jehovah and the king he has chosen are witnesses today that you have found me to be completely innocent « . They answered : » That is right , Jehovah is our witness ! «
Samuel continued : » Jehovah chose Moses and Aaron and brought your ancestors out of Egypt .
» Now stand where you are . I will judge you before Jehovah by reminding you of all the mighty actions Jehovah did to save you and your ancestors .
» When Jacob and his family went to Egypt the Egyptians oppressed them . Your ancestors cried to Jehovah for help . He sent Moses and Aaron , who brought them out of Egypt and settled them in this land .
» But the people forgot Jehovah their God . So he let the Philistines and the king of Moab and Sisera , commander of the army of the city of Hazor , fight against your ancestors and conquer them .
» Again they cried to Jehovah for help ! They said : ‘ We have sinned , because we turned away from you , Jehovah . We worshiped the idols of the Baals and the Ashtoreth Greek : Astarte . Rescue us from our enemies . We will worship you ! ’ «
» Jehovah sent Gideon , Barak , Jephthah , and finally me . Each of us rescued you from your enemies . You lived in safety .
» But when you saw that King Nahash of Ammon was about to attack you , you rejected Jehovah as your king . You said to me : ‘ We want a human king to rule us . ’ «
» Now here is the king you have chosen . You asked for him . Now Jehovah gives him to you .
» All will go well with you if you honor Jehovah your God , serve him , listen to him , and obey his commands . If you and your king follow Jehovah all will be well .
» But if you do not listen to Jehovah but disobey his commands , he will be against you and your king . He was against your fathers because they disobeyed .
» So then , stand where you are , and you will see the great thing that Jehovah will do .
» It is the dry season and the wheat harvest . I will pray and Jehovah will send thunder and rain . When this happens , you will realize that you committed a great sin against Jehovah when you asked him for a king . «
Samuel prayed . That same day Jehovah sent thunder and rain . Then all the people became afraid of Jehovah and of Samuel .
They said to Samuel : » Please pray to Jehovah your God for us , that we will not die . We now realize that we have added to all our sins the evil of asking for a human king . «
» Do not be afraid ! « Samuel answered . » Even though you have done such an evil thing , do not turn away from Jehovah . Serve him with all your heart .
» Do not go after false gods and empty things . They cannot help you or save you . They are useless .
» Jehovah made a solemn promise . He will not abandon you . You are his people for his great name’s sake .
» As for me , far be it from me that I should sin against Jehovah by no longer praying for you . Instead , I will teach you what is good and right for you to do .
» Reverence Jehovah and serve him in truth with all your heart . Remember the great things he has done for you .
» If you continue to sin , you and your king will be destroyed . «
Saul was thirty years old when he became king . He was king of Israel forty-two years .
Saul chose three thousand men from Israel . Two thousand of them were stationed with Saul at Michmash and in the mountains of Bethel . One thousand were stationed with Jonathan at Gibeah in Benjamin . He sent the rest of the people home .
Jonathan defeated the Philistine troops at Geba . The Philistines heard about it . With the sounding of the trumpet throughout the land , Saul announced : » Let the Hebrews listen ! «
All Israel listened as Saul told that he had defeated the Philistine troops . Now Israel has gone on the offensive against the Philistines . All the troops rallied behind Saul at Gilgal .
The Philistines assembled to fight Israel . They had thirty thousand chariots , six thousand horsemen , and as many soldiers as the sand on the seashore . They camped at Michmash , east of Beth Aven .
The Israelite army realized that they were outnumbered and were going to lose the battle . Some of the Israelite men hid in caves , thickets and rocks . Others hid in tombs or in deep dry pits .
Some of them went to Gad and Gilead on the other side of the Jordan River . Saul stayed at Gilgal . His soldiers trembled with fear .
They were starting to run off and leave him . Saul waited there seven days , just as Samuel had ordered him to do . But Samuel did not come .
Saul commanded : » Bring me some animals so we can offer sacrifices to please Jehovah . Then we can ask for his help . « Saul slaughtered one of the animals ,
and just as he was placing it on the altar , Samuel arrived . So Saul went out to welcome him .
Samuel asked : » What have you done ? « Saul replied : » I saw the troops were scattering . You did not come when you said you would and the Philistines were assembling at Michmash .
» So I thought the Philistines will come against me at Gilgal . I have not sought Jehovah’s favor . I felt pressured into sacrificing the burnt offering . «
» You did a foolish thing , « Samuel told Saul . » You did not follow the command of Jehovah your God . If you had , Jehovah would have established your kingdom over Israel from generation to generation for a very long time .
» Your kingdom will not last . Jehovah searched for a man after his own heart . Jehovah appointed him as ruler of his people . This is because you did not follow the command of Jehovah . «
Samuel left Gilgal . The rest of the people followed Saul to meet the soldiers . They went from Gilgal to Gibeah in Benjamin . Saul counted the troops who were still with him . There were about six hundred men .
Saul and his son Jonathan and the troops with them stayed at Geba Gebeah in Benjamin . The Philistines camped at Michmash .
Raiding parties left the Philistine camp in three companies . One company turned on the road to Ophrah to the region of Shual .
Another company turned to the road to Beth Horon . Another turned onto the road toward the region that overlooks the valley of Zeboim and the desert .
No blacksmith could be found in all of Israel . In this way the Philistines kept the Hebrews from making swords and spears .
Everyone in Israel had to go to the Philistines to sharpen the blade of his plow , his mattock , ax , or sickle .
The charge for sharpening plowshares and for the mattocks , and for the mattocks , and for the three-pronged forks , and for the axes was a pim .
So in the day of battle there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people with Saul and Jonathan . But with Saul and with his son Jonathan there was found sword and spear .
The garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash .
Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who carried his armor : » Come and let us go over to the Philistine outpost on the other side . « He did not tell his father .
Saul stayed on the edge of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree in Migron . There were about six hundred men with him .
Ahiah son of Ahitub , Ichabod’s brother , son of Phinehas , son of Eli , Jehovah’s priest in Shiloh , who was wearing an ephod were with him . The people did not know that Jonathan was gone .
Johathan tried to go over to the Philistines garrison between the passes . There was a rocky crag on each side . The name of the one was Bozez , and the name of the other crag was Seneh .
One cliff was on the north side of the pass facing Michmash . The other was on the south side facing Geba .
Jonathan said to the young man : » Let us cross over to the camp of those heathen Philistines . Maybe Jehovah will help us . If he does , nothing can keep him from giving us the victory no matter how few of us there are . «
His armor bearer answered him : » Do whatever you have in mind . Go ahead ! I agree with you . «
» We will do this , « Jonathan said . » We will go across so they can see us .
» If they agree to come to us down the hill and fight where we are , then we will not climb up to their camp .
» But we will go to them if they tell us to come up the hill and fight . That will mean Jehovah will help us win . «
So they let the Philistines see them . The Philistines said : » Some Hebrews are coming out of the holes they were hiding in ! «
They called out to Jonathan and the young man : » Come up here ! We have something to tell you ! « Jonathan said to the young man : » Follow me , for Jehovah gives Israel victory over them . «
Jonathan climbed out of the pass on his hands and knees . The young man followed him . Jonathan attacked the Philistines and knocked them down . The young man killed them .
In that first slaughter Jonathan and the young man killed about twenty men in an area of about half an acre .
There was panic among the army in the field . All the troops in the military post trembled with fear . The raiding party also trembled in fear . The earth shook , and there was a panic sent from God .
Saul’s watchmen at Gibeah of Benjamin could see the crowd in the Philistine camp dispersing in all directions .
» Call the roll , « Saul told the troops who were with him , » See who has left our camp . « They looked and found that Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there .
Then Saul said to Ahijah : » Bring the Ark of God here . « At that time it was with the Israelites .
While Saul was talking to the priest , the confusion in the Philistine camp grew worse . Then Saul said to the priest : » Remove your hand . «
Saul and all the people with him came together and went forward to the battle . Every man’s sword was turned against the man at his side . There was a very great noise .
The Hebrews who had been with the Philistines for some time went to their camp . They joined the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan .
All the men of Israel who had taken cover in the mountains of Ephraim , hearing that the Philistines had been put to flight chased them and attacked them .
Jehovah made Israel safe that day . The battle shifted to Beth-aven .
And all the people were with Saul . There were about twenty thousand men . The fight was general through all the mountains of Ephraim . Saul made a great error that day . He put the people under an oath , saying : » Let that man be cursed who eats any food before evening . I have taken vengeance on my enemies . « So the people did not eat .
All the people came to the forest . There was honey on the ground . The bees had gone from it .
When the people entered the woods , the honey was flowing . But no one put his hand to his mouth . The people were afraid of violating their oath .
Jonathan had not heard that his father forced the people to take an oath . So he stretched out the tip of the staff he had in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb . When he put it to his mouth his eyes lit up .
Then one of the people told him : » Your father forced the people to take a solemn oath , saying : ‘ Cursed is anyone who eats food today . ’ « That is why the people were exhausted .
Jonathan answered : » My father brought trouble to the country . See how my eyes lit up when I tasted a little of this honey ?
» If only the people had eaten some of the enemies’ food they found today . We would have killed more Philistines . «
That day they struck down the Philistines from Michmash to Aijalon , but the people were thoroughly exhausted .
They grabbed the food they had captured from the Philistines and started eating . They even killed sheep and cows and calves right on the ground and ate the meat without draining the blood .
Someone told Saul : » The army is disobeying Jehovah by eating meat before the blood drains out . « » You are right , « Saul answered . » They are being unfaithful to Jehovah ! Hurry ! Roll a big rock over here . «
» Then tell everyone in camp to bring their cattle and lambs to me . They can kill the animals on this rock and then eat the meat . That way no one will disobey Jehovah by eating meat with blood still in it . « That night the people brought their cattle over to the big rock and killed them there .
It was the first altar Saul had built for offering sacrifices to Jehovah .
Saul said : » Let us attack the Philistines again while it is still dark . We can fight them all night . Let us kill them and take everything they own ! « The people answered : » We will do whatever you want . « Ahijah the priest said : » Wait ! Let us ask God what we should do . «
Saul asked God : » Should I attack the Philistines ? Will you help us win ? « This time God did not answer .
Saul called his army officers together and said : » We have to find out what sin has kept God from answering .
» I promise by the living Jehovah , who gives Israel victory , that the guilty one will be put to death , even if he is my son Jonathan . « But no one said anything .
Then Saul said to them : » All of you stand over there . Jonathan and I will stand over here . « » Do whatever you think best , « they answered .
Saul said to Jehovah the God of Israel , give a perfect lot . Jonathan and Samuel were taken , but the people escaped .
Then Saul said : » Cast lots to decide between my son Jonathan and me . « And Jonathan was indicated .
Then Saul asked Jonathan : » What have you done ? « Jonathan answered : » I ate a little honey with the stick I was holding . Here I am . I am ready to die . «
Saul said : » May God strike me dead if you are not put to death ! «
But the people said to Saul : » Will Jonathan , who won this great victory for Israel , be put to death ? « » No ! We promise by the living Jehovah that he will not lose even a hair from his head . What he did today was done with God’s help . « So the people saved Jonathan from being put to death .
After that , Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines . The Philistines went back to their own territory .
After Saul became king of Israel , he fought all his enemies everywhere : the people of Moab , of Ammon , and of Edom , the kings of Zobah , and the Philistines . He was victorious wherever he fought .
He fought heroically and defeated even the people of Amalek . He saved the Israelites from all attacks .
Saul’s sons were Jonathan , Ishvi , and Malchishua . The names of his two daughters were Merab the firstborn daughter and Michal the younger daughter .
The name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz . The name of the commander of his army was Abner son of Saul’s uncle Ner .
Kish , Saul’s father and Ner , Abner’s father , were the sons of Abiel .
There was intense warfare with the Philistines as long as Saul lived . Whenever any warrior or any skilled fighting man came to Saul’s attention , Saul would enlist him in the army .
Samuel told Saul : » Jehovah sent me to anoint you king of his people Israel . Now listen to Jehovah’s words :
‘ The Israelites were on their way out of Egypt when the nation of Amalek attacked them . I am Jehovah All-Powerful . I am going to make Amalek pay for what he did to Israel !
» ‘ Go and attack the Amalekites ! Destroy them and all their possessions . Do not have any pity . Kill their men , women , children , and even their babies . Slaughter their cattle , sheep , camels , and donkeys . ’ «
Saul called his forces together and inspected them at Telem . There were two hundred thousand soldiers from Israel and ten thousand from Judah .
Then he and his men went to the city of Amalek . They waited in ambush in a dry riverbed .
He sent a warning to the Kenites , a people whose ancestors had been kind to the Israelites when they came from Egypt : » Go away and leave the Amalekites . That way I will not kill you along with them . « So the Kenites left .
Saul defeated the Amalekites . He fought all the way from Havilah to Shur , east of Egypt .
He captured King Agag of Amalek alive and with the sword he killed all the people .
Saul and his men spared Agag’s life and did not kill the best sheep and cattle , the best calves and lambs , or anything else that was good . They destroyed only what was useless or worthless .
Jehovah spoke to Samuel :
» I am sorry that I made Saul king . He has turned away from me and disobeyed my commands . « Samuel was angry . All night long he pleaded with Jehovah .
Early the following morning he went off to find Saul . He heard that Saul had gone to the town of Carmel . There in Carmel he built a monument to himself . Then he went to Gilgal .
Samuel went up to Saul . Saul said : » Jehovah bless you , Samuel ! I have obeyed Jehovah’s command . «
Samuel asked : » Why do I hear the sound of cows and sheep ? «
Saul answered : » The army brought them from the Amalekites . They spared the best sheep and cows to sacrifice to Jehovah your God . But the rest they claimed for God and destroyed them . «
» Be quiet , « Samuel told Saul , » Let me tell you what Jehovah told me last night . « » Speak , « Saul replied .
Samuel said to Saul : » You are little in your own eyes . Even though you are a leader of all of the tribes of Israel that Jehovah anointed king over Israel .
» Jehovah sent you on a mission . He said : Go and destroy those sinners , the Amalekites . Fight against them until every one is dead .
» Why then did you not obey the voice of Jehovah ? Why did you pounce on the plunder ? Why did you do evil in the sight of Jehovah ? «
Then Saul said to Samuel : » I did obey the voice of Jehovah . I went on the mission Jehovah sent me . I brought back Agag the king of Amalek . I have utterly destroyed the Amalekites . »
The people took from the plunder of the flock the best of the sheep and cattle to sacrifice to Jehovah your God in Gilgal .
Samuel said : » What is more pleasing to Jehovah , burnt offerings and sacrifices or your obedience to his voice ? Obeying is better than sacrifice . To pay attention is better than the fat of rams .
» The sin of divination is rebellion . Wickedness and idolatry are arrogance . They are evil . Because you rejected the word of Jehovah , he rejects you as king . «
Then Saul told Samuel : » I have sinned by not following Jehovah’s command or your instructions . I was afraid of the people and listened to them .
» But now I beg you , forgive my sin and return with me , so that I can worship Jehovah . «
» I will not return with you , « Samuel answered . » You rejected Jehovah’s command . He has rejected you as king of Israel . «
Samuel turned to leave , but Saul caught hold of his cloak , and it tore .
Samuel said to him : » Jehovah has torn the kingdom of Israel away from you today . He gave it to someone who is a better man than you .
» The Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind . He is not a mortal who changes his mind . «
Saul replied : » I have sinned ! Now please honor me in front of the elders of my people and in front of Israel . Come back with me . Let me worship Jehovah your God ! «
Then Samuel turned and followed Saul . Saul worshiped Jehovah .
» Bring me King Agag of the Amalekites , « Samuel said . Agag came to him trembling . » Surely , the bitterness of death is past , « Agag said .
But Samuel said : » As your sword made women childless , so your mother will be made childless among women . « Samuel cut Agag in pieces in the presence of Jehovah at Gilgal .
Samuel went to Ramah . Saul went up to his house in Gibeah , in the land of Saul .
Samuel never saw Saul again until the day of his death . Samuel went into mourning for Saul . It was no longer Jehovah’s pleasure for Saul to be king over Israel .
Jehovah said to Samuel : » How long will you mourn for Saul ? After all I have rejected him from being king over Israel ? Take oil in your vessel and go . I will send you to Jesse , the Beth-lehemite . I have a king from among his sons . «
» How can I go ? « Samuel asked . » When Saul hears about it he will kill me « Jehovah said : » Take a heifer with you and say : ‘ I have come to sacrifice to Jehovah . ’ «
» Then invite Jesse to the sacrifice . I will reveal to you what you should do . You will anoint the one I point out to you . «
Samuel did what Jehovah told him . When he came to Bethlehem the elders of the city trembled at his coming . They greeted him and said : » May peace be with you . «
» Greetings , « he replied , » I have come to sacrifice to Jehovah . » Perform the ceremonies to make yourselves holy , and come with me to the sacrifice . « He performed the ceremonies for Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice .
When they entered he looked at Eliab and thought : » Surely Jehovah’s anointed is before Him . «
But Jehovah said to Samuel : » Do not look at his appearance or at the height of his stature . I have rejected him . God does not see as man sees . Man looks at the outward appearance . Jehovah looks at the heart inner man . «
Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel . Samuel said : » Jehovah has not chosen this one either . «
Next Jesse made Shammah pass by . He said : » Jehovah has not chosen this one either . «
So Jesse brought seven more of his sons to Samuel , but Samuel told Jesse : » Jehovah has not chosen any of these . «
» Are these all the sons you have ? « Samuel asked . » There is still the youngest one , « Jesse answered . » He is tending sheep . « Samuel responded : » Send someone to get him . We will not continue until he gets here . «
Jesse sent for him . He was a handsome , healthy young man , and his eyes sparkled . Jehovah said to Samuel : » This is the one . Anoint him ! «
Samuel took the olive oil and anointed David in front of his brothers . Immediately the Spirit of Jehovah took control of David and was with him from that day on . Then Samuel returned to Ramah .
Jehovah’s Spirit left Saul , and a distressing spirit sent by Jehovah tormented him .
His servants said to him : » We know that a distressing spirit sent by God is tormenting you .
» So give us the order and we will look for a man who knows how to play the harp . Then when the distressing spirit comes on you , the man can play his harp , and you will be all right again . «
Saul ordered : » Find me a man who plays well and bring him to me . «
One of his attendants said : » Jesse of the town of Bethlehem has a son who is a good musician . He is also a brave and handsome man , a good soldier , and an able speaker . Jehovah is with him . «
Saul sent a message to Jesse : » Tell your son David to leave your sheep and come here to me . «
Jesse loaded a donkey with bread and a goatskin full of wine . He told David to take the donkey and a young goat to Saul .
David went to Saul and worked for him . Saul liked him so much that he put David in charge of carrying his weapons .
Not long after this , Saul sent another message to Jesse : » I really like David . Please let him stay with me . «
Whenever the distressing spirit from God bothered Saul , David would play his harp . Saul would relax and feel better . The distressing spirit would go away .
The Philistines got ready for war and brought their troops together to attack the town of Socoh in Judah . They set up camp at Ephes-Dammim , between Socoh and Azekah .
Saul and the men of Israel came together and took up their position in the valley of Elah . They drew up in battle array against the Philistines .
The Philistines were stationed on the mountain on one side . Israel was on the mountain on the other side . There was a valley between them .
A fighter came out from the tents of the Philistines . His name was Goliath of Gath . He was over nine feet tall .
He had a headdress of copper on his head . He was dressed in a coat of metal that weighed one hundred twenty five pounds .
He had copper shin guards on his legs and on his back a copper javelin .
The shaft of his spear was like the beam used by weavers . The head of his spear was made of fifteen pounds of iron . The man who carried his shield walked ahead of him .
Goliath stood and called to the Israelites : » Why do you form a battle line ? Am I not a Philistine ? Are you Saul’s servants ? Choose a man , and let him come down to fight me .
» If he can fight me and kill me we will be your slaves . But if I overpower him and kill him you will be our slaves and serve us . «
The Philistine added : » I challenge the Israelite battle line today . Send out a man so we can fight each other . «
Saul and all the Israelites were overcome with fear when they heard what this Philistine said .
David was a son of a man named Jesse from the region of Ephrath and the city of Bethlehem in Judah . Jesse had eight sons . In Saul’s day he was an old man .
Jesse’s three oldest sons joined Saul’s army for the battle . The firstborn was Eliab , the second was Abinadab , and the third was Shammah .
David was the youngest . The three oldest joined Saul’s army .
David went back and forth from Saul’s camp to Bethlehem , where he tended his father’s flock .
Each morning and evening for forty days the Philistine came forward and made his challenge .
Jesse told his son David : » Take this half-bushel of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread to your brothers . Take them to your brothers in the camp right away .
» Also take these ten slices of cheese to the commanding officer . Find out how your brothers are getting along . Bring back something to show that you saw them and that they are well .
» King Saul , your brothers , and all the other Israelites are in Elah Valley fighting the Philistines . «
David obeyed his father . He got up early the next morning and left someone else in charge of the sheep . He loaded the supplies and started off . He reached the army camp just as the soldiers were taking their places and shouting the battle cry .
The army of Israel and the Philistine army stood there facing each other .
David left his things with the man in charge of supplies . He ran up to the battle line to ask his brothers if they were well .
David talked to his brothers . Goliath came out from the line of Philistines and boasted as usual . David heard him .
When the Israelite soldiers saw Goliath they were afraid and ran off .
They said to each other : » Look how he keeps coming out to insult us . The king offers a big reward to the man who kills Goliath . That man will even get to marry the king’s daughter . No one in his family will ever have to pay taxes again . «
David asked some soldiers standing nearby : » What will a man get for killing this Philistine and stopping him from insulting our people ? Who does that worthless Philistine think he is ? He makes fun of the army of the living God ! «
The soldiers repeated to David how the man who kills Goliath would be treated .
Eliab , David’s oldest brother , heard David talking to the men . Then Eliab became angry with David . » Why did you come here , « he asked him , « and with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness ? I know how overconfident and headstrong you are . You came here just to see the battle . «
» What have I done now ? « David snapped at him . » Did I just ask a question ? «
He turned to face another man and asked the same question . The other soldiers gave him the same answer .
What David said was overheard and reported to Saul . Saul sent for him .
David told Saul : » No one should be discouraged because of this . I will go and fight this Philistine . «
Saul responded to David : » You cannot fight this Philistine . You are just a boy . He has been a warrior since he was your age . «
David replied to Saul : » I am a shepherd for my father’s sheep . When a lion or a bear comes and carries off a sheep from the flock ,
» I go after it , attack it , and rescue the lamb . If the lion or bear turns on me , I grab it by the throat and beat it to death .
» I have killed lions and bears . I will do the same to this heathen Philistine . He has defied the army of the living God .
» Jehovah saved me from lions and bears . He will save me from this Philistine . « Saul answered : » Go and Jehovah be with you . «
He gave his own armor to David for him to wear . It consisted of a copper helmet , which he put on David’s head , and a coat of armor .
David strapped Saul’s sword over the armor and tried to walk . But he could not walk . » I cannot fight with all this , « he said to Saul . » I am not used to it . « So he took it all off .
He took his shepherd’s stick and picked up five smooth stones from the stream and put them in his bag . With his sling ready , he went out to meet Goliath .
The Philistine , preceded by the man carrying his shield came closer and closer to David .
The Philistine got a good look at David and he despised him . David was only a young man with a healthy complexion and good looks .
The Philistine asked David : » Am I a dog that you come to attack me with sticks ? « So the Philistine called on his gods to curse David .
» Come here , « the Philistine told David , » and I will give your body to the birds . «
David answered : » You come out to fight me with a sword and a spear and a dagger . But I come out to fight you in the name of Jehovah of Hosts . He is the Almighty God of Israel’s army . You have insulted him !
» Today Jehovah will help me defeat you . I will knock you down and cut off your head ! I will feed the bodies of the other Philistine soldiers to the birds and wild animals . Then the whole world will know that Israel has a real God .
» Everybody here will see that Jehovah does not need swords or spears to save his people . Jehovah always wins his battles . He will help us defeat you ! «
Goliath started forward and David ran toward him .
He put a rock in his sling and swung the sling around by its straps . When he let go of one strap , the rock flew out and hit Goliath on the forehead . It cracked his skull . He fell facedown on the ground .
So David overcame the Philistine with his leather band and a stone . The Philistine was wounded and laying on the ground . But David had no sword in his hand .
He ran to him and stood over him . David took Goliath’s sword out of its sheath and cut off his head to kill him . When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead they ran away .
The men of Israel and Judah shouted and ran after them . They pursued them all the way to Gath and to the gates of Ekron . The Philistines fell wounded all along the road that leads to Shaaraim , as far as Gath and Ekron .
The sons of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines . They plundered their tents .
David took the head of the Philistine to Jerusalem . But he put his armor in his tent .
When Saul saw David going out against the Philistine , he asked Abner the commander of the army : » Abner , whose son is this young man ? « Abner said : » By your life , O king , I do not know . «
The king said : » Find out whose son the young man is . «
When David returned from killing the Philistine , Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the Philistine’s head in his hand .
Saul said : » Whose son are you , young man ? « David answered : » I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite . «
David finished talking to Saul . Jonathan became David’s closest friend . He loved David as much as he loved himself .
Saul kept him with him that day and would not let him go home to his father’s house any more .
Jonathan made a covenant with David . He loved him as himself .
Jonathan removed the robe he was wearing . He gave it to David along with his armor , including his sword , his bow and his belt .
So David did everything Saul sent him to do successfully . Saul made him a commander in his army . This pleased the people and Saul’s servants .
David returned from a campaign against the Philistines . That same day women from all of Israel’s cities came to meet King Saul . They sang and danced . Tambourines , joyful music , and triangles accompanied them .
The women who celebrated sang : » Saul has defeated thousands but David tens of thousands ! «
Saul became very angry because he considered this saying to be insulting . He said : » To David they credit tens of thousands but to me they credit only a few thousand . The only thing left for David is my kingdom . «
He was jealous and suspicious of David from that day on .
The next day Jehovah let a distressing spirit take control of Saul . He began acting like a crazy man inside his house . David came to play the harp for Saul as usual . This time Saul had a spear in his hand .
Saul balanced the spear in his hand and said : » I will give David a blow ! I will pin him to the wall . « David got away from him twice .
Saul was afraid of David , because Jehovah was with David but left Saul .
So Saul sent him away . He put him in command of a thousand men . David led his men in battle .
Jehovah helped David . He and his soldiers always won their battles .
Saul saw how wisely David behaved . This made him fear him .
Everyone in Israel and Judah loved David . He led them in and out of battle .
Finally , Saul said to David : » Here is my oldest daughter Merab . I will give her to you as your wife if you prove yourself to be a warrior for me and fight Jehovah’s battles . « Saul thought : » I must not lay a hand on him . Let the Philistines do that . «
David answered : » Who am I ? What is my family that I should be the king’s son-in-law ? «
The time came for Merab to be given to David . Instead , she was given to a man named Adriel from Meholah .
Saul’s daughter Michal fell in love with David . When Saul heard of this he was pleased .
He said to himself : » I will give Michal to David . I will use her to trap him . The Philistines will kill him . « So for the second time Saul said to David : » You will be my son-in-law . «
Saul ordered his officials to speak to David in private . They went to David and said : » Look , the king likes you , and all of his officials are loyal to you . Why not ask the king if you may marry his daughter Michal ? «
Saul’s servants said these things to David . And David said : » I am not rich or famous enough to marry Princess Michal . «
Saul’s servants told him : » David asked , do you think it is easy to become the king’s son-in-law ? I am a poor and unimportant person . «
When the officers told Saul what David had said ,
Saul’s officials reported to David what Saul had said . David was delighted with the thought of becoming the king’s son-in-law . Before the day set for the wedding ,
David and his men killed two hundred Philistines . He took their foreskins to the king and counted them all out to him . This was so he might become his son-in-law . So Saul had to give his daughter Michal in marriage to David .
Saul knew she loved David . He also realized that Jehovah was helping David .
Knowing those things made Saul even more afraid of David . He was David’s enemy for the rest of his life .
The Philistine rulers kept coming to fight Israel . David always won when he fought them . He won more battles against the Philistines than any of Saul’s other officers . This made him famous .
Saul told Jonathan his son and all his servants to kill David . But Jonathan was very fond of David .
Jonathan told David : » My father Saul is seeking to kill you . Please be on guard in the morning , and stay in a secret place and hide yourself .
» I will stand beside my father in the field where you will be . I will speak with my father about you . If I find out anything I will tell you . «
Jonathan spoke well of David to his father Saul . » You should not commit a sin against your servant David , « he said . » He has not sinned against you . He has in fact done some very fine things for you .
» He risked his life and killed the Philistine Goliath . Jehovah gave all Israel a great victory . You rejoiced when you saw it . Why should you sin by shedding David’s innocent blood for no reason ? «
Jonathan convinced Saul , so Saul made a vow in Jehovah’s name that he would not kill David .
Jonathan called to David and told him what Saul said . Then he brought David to Saul . David served in Saul’s army just as he had done before .
Then there was a war with the Philistines . David fought hard and forced them to retreat .
One night , David was in Saul’s home , playing the harp for him . Saul sat there with a spear in his hand . The distressing spirit from Jehovah took control of him .
Saul tried to pin David to the wall with his spear . David dodged it , and Saul’s spear struck the wall . David escaped from Saul that night .
Saul sent messengers to watch David’s house and kill him in the morning . Michal , David’s wife advised him : » If you do not save yourself tonight , you will be dead tomorrow ! «
Michal lowered David through a window . He ran away to escape .
Then Michal took some idols , laid them in the bed , put a goat-hair blanket at its head , and covered the idols with a garment .
Saul sent messengers to get David . Michal said : » He is sick . «
Then Saul sent messengers to see David . They said : » Bring him up to me on his bed . I will put him to death . «
The messengers entered . There , on the bed was the household idol with the quilt of goats’ hair at its head .
Saul said to Michal : » Why have you deceived me like this ? You let my enemy go . He has escaped ! « Michal said to Saul : » He said to me : ‘ Let me go ! Why should I kill you ? ’ «
David escaped to Samuel at Ramah . He told him all that Saul had done to him . He and Samuel stayed in Naioth .
Saul was told : » David is at Naioth in Ramah . «
Saul sent messengers to get David . They saw a group of prophets prophesying with their leader Samuel . God’s Spirit came over Saul’s messengers so that they also prophesied .
Saul heard what happened . So he sent another group of messengers , but they prophesied the same way . He sent a third group of messengers , but the same thing happened to them .
Finally , Saul left for Ramah himself . He went as far as the deep pit at the town of Secu . He asked : » Where are Samuel and David ? « The people answered : » At Prophets Village in Ramah . «
He went on from there to Naioth in Ramah . The spirit of God came on him and he acted like a prophet . Then he arrived at Naioth in Ramah .
He even took off his clothes as he prophesied in front of Samuel . He lay there naked all day and all night . The saying : » Is Saul one of the prophets ? « came from there .
David fled from the pastures at Ramah . He went to Jonathan and asked : » What have I done ? What crime am I guilty of ? What sin have I committed against your father that he tries to kill me ? «
He said to him : » It will not happen . You will not die ! My father does nothing either great or small without disclosing it to me . So why should my father hide this thing from me ? It is not so ! «
David again said : » Your father has certainly known that I have found favor in your eyes . « He said : » Do not let Jonathan know this , that he not be grieved . And yet , as Jehovah lives , and you live , there is only a step between death and me . «
Jonathan said : » I will do anything you want . «
» Tomorrow is the New Moon Festival , « David replied , » and I am supposed to eat with the king . But if it is all right with you , I will go and hide in the fields until the evening of the day after tomorrow .
» If your father notices that I am not at the table , tell him that I begged your permission to hurry home to Bethlehem . It is after all the time for the annual sacrifice there for my whole family .
» If he says : ‘ It is well . I will be safe . ’ ’ But if he becomes angry , you will know that he is determined to harm me .
» ‘ Therefore deal kindly with your servant . You brought your servant into a covenant of Jehovah with you . But if there is iniquity in me kill me yourself . Why should you take me to your father ? ’ «
Jonathan replied : » Far be it from you ! For if I should indeed learn my father decided to bring evil on you then would I not tell you about it ? «
David asked : » Who will tell me whether or not your father gives you a harsh answer ? «
Jonathan said : » Let us go out to the field . « So they went to the field .
» As Jehovah God of Israel is my witness , « Jonathan continued , » I will find out in the next two or three days how my father feels about you . If he does feel kindly toward you I will send someone to tell you .
» If my father plans to harm you and I do not send you away safely , may Jehovah harm me even more . Jehovah should be with you just as he used to be with my father .
» Someday Jehovah will wipe out all of your enemies . Then if I am still alive , please be as kind to me as Jehovah has been . But if I am dead , be kind to my family .
» Show the same kind of loyalty to my family as long as you live . When Jehovah has completely destroyed all your enemies ,
» May our promise to each other still be unbroken . If it is broken , Jehovah will punish you . «
Once again Jonathan made David promise to love him . Jonathan loved David as much as he loved himself .
Jonathan said to him : » Tomorrow is the New Moon Festival . Your absence will be noticed if you are not at the meal .
» The day after tomorrow you will be missed even more . So go to the place where you hid on that other occasion . Stay by the rock .
» I will shoot three arrows at a target off to the side of the rock .
» Then I will send my servant to find the arrows . You will know if it is safe to come out by what I tell him . If it is safe , I swear by the living God Jehovah that I will say : ‘ The arrows are on this side of you ! Pick them up !
» ‘ If it is not safe , I will say to the boy : The arrows are farther away ! This will mean that Jehovah wants you to leave . You must go .
» ‘ He will always watch us to make sure that we keep the promise we made to each other . ’ «
David hid there in the field . It was the New Moon Festival . Saul sat down to eat .
He ate by the wall , just as he always did . Jonathan sat across from him . Abner sat next to him . But David’s place was empty .
Saul was in deep thought . So he did not say anything that day . Something must have happened to make David unfit to be at the Festival . Yes , something must have happened .
David’s place was still empty the day after the New Moon Festival . Saul asked Jonathan : » Why has that son of Jesse not come to eat with us ? He was not here yesterday , and he still is not here today ! «
Jonathan answered Saul : » David earnestly asked permission of me to go to Bethlehem .
» David said to me : ‘ Please let me go , since our family must make a sacrifice in the city . My brother has commanded me to attend . If I have found favor in your sight , please let me get away that I may see my brothers . ’ ’ For this reason he has not come to the king’s table . ’ «
Saul got angry with Jonathan and he said , » You are Son of a crooked and rebellious woman Jonathan ! I know you have sided with Jesse’s son , Saul accused . You have no shame . You act as if you are your mother’s son not mine .
» As long as Jesse’s son lives on earth , neither you nor your right to be king is secure . Send some men to bring him to me . He is a dead man ! «
Jonathan asked his father : » Why should he be killed ? What has he done ? «
Saul threw his spear at Jonathan and tried to kill him . Then Jonathan was sure that his father really did want to kill David .
Jonathan was angry that his father had insulted David . He got up and left the table . He did not eat anything all that day .
In the morning Jonathan went out to the field to meet David . He took a servant boy along .
Jonathan told him : » When I shoot the arrows , you run and find them for me . « The boy started running , and Jonathan shot an arrow so that it would go beyond him .
When the boy reached the place where the arrow fell Jonathan shouted to him : » The arrow is farther on !
» Do not just stand there ! Hurry up ! » The boy picked up the arrow and returned to his master .
The boy did not know what it all meant . Only Jonathan and David knew .
Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and told him to take them back to town .
After the boy left , David got up from behind the pile of stones . He fell on his knees and bowed with his face to the ground three times . Both he and Jonathan cried as they kissed each other . David’s grief was even greater than Jonathan’s .
Jonathan said to David : » God be with you . Jehovah will make sure that you and I , and your descendants and mine , will keep the sacred promise we have made to each other for as long as we live . « Then David left and Jonathan went back to town .

David went to the priest Ahimelech at Nob . Ahimelech was afraid when he met David . » Why are you alone ? « He asked David . » Why is no one with you ? «
The king ordered me to do something , David answered the priest Ahimelech , and he told me : » No one must know anything about this mission I am sending you to do . I have stationed my young men at a certain place . «
David added : » What do you have to eat ? Give me five loaves of bread or whatever you can find . «
The high priest answered David : » I do not have any ordinary bread here . But there is holy bread for the young men if they have not had sexual intercourse today . «
David answered the priest : » Women have been kept away from us as usual when we go on a mission . The young men’s bodies are kept holy even on ordinary campaigns . How much more then are their bodies holy today ? «
The priest gave him holy bread . For he only had the bread of the presence that had been taken from Jehovah’s presence and replaced with warm bread that day .
That same day one of Saul’s servants who was obligated to stay in Jehovah’s presence was there . His name was Doeg . He was chief herdsman for Saul’s shepherds from Edom .
David asked Ahimelech : » Do you have a spear or a sword here ? I did not take either my spear or any other weapon because the king’s business was urgent . «
The high priest answered : » The sword of Goliath the Philistine , whom you killed in the Elah Valley , is here . It is wrapped in a cloth behind the priestly ephod . Take it if you want . There is no other weapon here . « David said : » There is none like it . Let me have the sword . «
David kept running from Saul that day until he came to Gath . There he met with King Achish .
The officers of King Achish were also there . They asked Achish : » Is David a king back in his own country ? Do the Israelites not dance and sing : ‘ Saul has killed a thousand enemies ; David has killed ten thousand enemies ? ’ «
David thought about what they said . It made him afraid of Achish .
Right there in front of everyone , he pretended to be insane . He acted confused and scratched up the doors of the town gate . He drooled in his beard .
Look at him ! Achish said to his officers . You can see he is crazy . Why did you bring him to me ?
I have enough crazy people without your bringing another one here . Keep him away from my palace !
David escaped from the town of Gath and he went to Adullam Cave . Once they found out where he was his brothers and the rest of his family followed him there .
A lot of other people joined him too . Some were in trouble . Others were angry or in debt . David was soon the leader of four hundred men .
David went from there to Mizpah in Moab . He said to the king of Moab : » Please let my father and my mother come and stay with you until I know what God will do for me . «
He left them with the king of Moab . So they stayed with him all the time that David was in the stronghold .
» Do not live in your stronghold , « the prophet Gad told David . » Go to the land of Judah . So David went to the forest of Hereth . «
Saul heard that David and his men were found . Saul stayed in Gibeah under the tamarisk tree at the worship site . He held his spear in his hand . All his officials stood around him .
He said to his officials : » Listen to me men of Benjamin ! Will Jesse’s son give every one of you fields and vineyards ? Will he make you all officers over a regiment or a battalion of soldiers ?
» All of you are plotting against me . No one informed me when my son entered into a loyalty pledge with Jesse’s son . No one felt sorry for me . And no one informed me that my son has encouraged my servant David to ambush me , as he is doing now . «
Doeg from Edom , standing with Saul’s officials , answered him : » I saw Jesse’s son when he came to Ahimelech , Ahitub’s son , in Nob .
» Ahimelech prayed to Jehovah for David . He gave him food and the sword of Goliath the Philistine . «
Then the king sent for the priest Ahimelech son of Ahitub’s and his entire family who were the priests in Nob . All of them came to the king .
Saul said : » Listen here , son of Ahitub ! « He responded : » Here I am lord . «
Saul asked him : » Why did you and Jesse’s son plot against me ? You gave him bread and a sword . You even prayed to God that he could rise up against me and ambush me , as he is doing now . «
Ahimelech asked the king : » But whom among all your officials can you trust like David ? Your Majesty , he is your son-in-law , the commander of your bodyguard . He is honored in your own household .
» Is this the first time I have prayed to God for him ? Not at all ! You should not blame my family or me for this . I knew nothing at all about this . «
The king said : » Ahimelech , you and your entire family are going to die . «
The king said to the guards who were attending him : » Turn around and kill the priests of Jehovah ! They are also with David . They knew that he was fleeing and did not reveal it to me . But the servants of the king were not willing to lift a hand to attack the priests of Jehovah . «
The king said to Doeg : » You turn around and attack the priests . « Doeg the Edomite turned around and attacked the priests . That day he killed eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod .
He also killed the people of Nob , the city of the priests . Using his sword , he killed men and women , children and infants , cows , donkeys , and sheep .
Ahimelech , Ahitub’s son had one son who escaped . His name was Abiathar . He fled to David .
Abiathar told David that Saul killed Jehovah’s priests .
David told Abiathar : » I knew that day when Doeg from Edom was there that he would be certain to tell Saul . I am the one responsible for all the lives of your family .
» Stay with me . Do not be afraid . The one who is seeking my life is also seeking your life . You will be under my protection . «
David heard that the Philistines attacked the town of Keilah . They robbed the threshing floors of the newly harvested grain .
He asked Jehovah : » Shall I go and attack the Philistines ? « Jehovah answered : » Yes , Attack them and save Keilah . «
David’s men said to him : » We have enough to be afraid of here in Judah . It will be worse if we go to Keilah and attack the Philistine forces ! «
David consulted Jehovah once again , and Jehovah said to him : » Go attack Keilah ! I will give you victory over the Philistines . «
David and his men went to Keilah and fought the Philistines . They drove off their livestock , and overwhelmingly defeated them . So David rescued the people who lived in Keilah .
When Ahimelech’s son Abiathar fled to David at Keilah , Abiathar brought a priestly ephod with him .
When Saul was told that David went to Keilah , Saul said : » God has delivered him into my hands . He has trapped himself by going into a city which has a gate with a double door held shut by a bar . «
So Saul called all the troops to go to war . They wanted to blockade Keilah , where David and his men were .
David learned that Saul was planning to harm him . He told the priest Abiathar : » Bring the ephod ! «
Then David said : » Jehovah God of Israel , I have actually heard that Saul is going to come to Keilah and destroy the city on account of me .
» Will the citizens of Keilah hand me over to him ? Will Saul come here as I have heard ? Jehovah God of Israel , please tell me . « Jehovah answered : » He will come . «
» Will the citizens of Keilah hand my men and me over to Saul ? « David asked . Jehovah answered : » They will hand you over . «
David and his men , about six hundred in all , left Keilah . They went wherever they could go . Then Saul was told : » David has escaped from Keilah ! So he gave up the campaign . «
David lived in fortified camps in the desert . He lived in fortified camps in the mountains of the desert of Ziph . Saul was always searching for him . But God did not let him capture David .
David was afraid because Saul had come to kill him at Horesh in the desert of Ziph .
Jonathan went to see David . God helped him encourage David .
» Do not be afraid , « Jonathan said . » My father Saul will never get his hands on you . In fact , you are going to be the next king of Israel . I will be your highest official . Even my father knows it is true . «
They both promised Jehovah that they would always be loyal to each other . Then Jonathan went home while David stayed at Horesh .
Some people from the town of Ziph went to Saul at Gibeah . They said : » Your Majesty , David has a hideout not far from us ! It is near Horesh . It is somewhere on Mount Hachilah south of Jeshimon .
» We know how much you want to capture him . Come to our territory and we will make sure you catch him . «
Saul answered : » May Jehovah bless you for being so kind to me !
» Go and make sure once more . Find out for certain where he is and who has seen him there . I hear that he is very cunning .
» Find out exactly the places where he hides . Be sure to bring back a report to me right away . Then I will go with you . If he is still in the region , I will hunt him down , even if I have to search the whole land of Judah . «
So they left and returned to Ziph ahead of Saul . David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon . They were in a desolate valley in the southern part of the Judean wilderness .
Saul and his men set out to look for David . David heard about it and went to a rocky hill in the wilderness of Maon and stayed there . When Saul heard about this he went after David .
Saul and his men were on one side of the hill . They were separated from David and his men , who were on the other side . They were hurrying to get away from Saul and his men , who were closing in on them and were about to capture them .
Just then a messenger arrived and said to Saul : » Come back at once ! The Philistines are invading the country ! «
Saul stopped pursuing David and went to fight the Philistines . That is why that place is called Separation Hill .
From there David went to stay in the fortified camps of En Gedi .
Saul returned from fighting the Philistines . He declared : » I have heard that David is in the desert around En-Gedi . «
Saul led three thousand of Israel’s best soldiers out to look for David and his men near Wild Goat Rocks at En-Gedi .
There were some sheep pens along the side of the road . One of them was built around the entrance to a cave . So Saul went into the cave to relieve himself . David and his men were hiding at the back of the cave .
They whispered to David : » Jehovah told you he was going to let you defeat your enemies and do whatever you want with them . This must be the day Jehovah was talking about . « David sneaked over and cut off a small piece of Saul’s robe and Saul did not notice .
Later David’s conscience bothered him because he had cut off the edge of Saul’s robe .
He told his men : » Stop talking foolishly . We are not going to attack Saul . He is my king . I pray that Jehovah will keep me from doing anything to harm his chosen king . «
David stopped his men by saying this to them . He did not let them attack Saul . Saul left the cave and went out onto the road .
Then David got up and left the cave . He called to Saul : » My lord ! « When Saul looked back . David knelt down with his face touching the ground .
David asked Saul : » Why do you listen to rumors that I am trying to harm you ?
» Today you saw how Jehovah handed you over to me in the cave . Although I was told to kill you I spared you . I said : ‘ I will not raise my hand against my lord because you are Jehovah’s anointed . ’ «
» My master , look at this ! The border of your robe is in my hand ! I cut off the border of your robe and did not kill you . You should know and be able to see I mean no harm or rebellion . I have not sinned against you ! But you are trying to ambush me in order to take my life .
» I will let Jehovah decide which one of us has done right . I pray that Jehovah will punish you for what you are doing to me . However , I will not do anything to you .
» An old proverb says : ‘ Only evil people do evil things . ’ ’ So I will not harm you .
» Why should the king of Israel be out chasing me , anyway ? I am as worthless as a dead dog or a flea .
» I pray that Jehovah will help me escape and show that I am in the right . «
» David , my son is that you ? « Saul asked . Then he started crying .
He said : » David , you are a better person than I am . You treated me with kindness when I was cruel to you .
» You have shown me how you were kind enough not to kill me when Jehovah gave you the chance .
» You would not let me live if you were my enemy . I pray that Jehovah will reward you for what you did today .
» I know now you will be the next king . You will be a powerful king too .
» Promise me with Jehovah as your witness , that you will not destroy my descendants . Let them live to keep my family name alive . «
David promised and Saul went home . David and his men returned to their hideout .
Samuel died . All Israel gathered to mourn him . They buried him at his home in Ramah . Then David went to the desert of Paran .
There was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel . He was a very rich man . He had three thousand sheep and one thousand goats . He sheared his sheep in Carmel .
His name was Nabal . He was of the family of Caleb . His wife’s name was Abigail . She was a woman of good sense and pleasing looks . The man was cruel and dishonest in his dealings .
While David was in the desert he heard that Nabal was shearing sheep .
David sent ten young men to Nabal . David said to them : » Go up to Carmel and go to Nabal , and say kind words to him in my name .
» Say to him : ‘ May you live long ! May you , your home , and all you have prosper !
» ‘ I hear that your sheepshearers are with you . Your shepherds have been with us . We have not mistreated them . Nothing of theirs has been missing as long as they have been in Carmel .
» ‘ Ask your shepherds . They will tell you the same thing . My servants are your servants . You are like a father to me . This is a day for celebrating . Please be kind and share some of your food with us . ’ «
David’s men went to Nabal and gave him David’s message . They waited for Nabal’s answer .
This is what he said : » Who does this David think he is ? That son of Jesse is just one more slave on the run from his master . There are too many of them now days .
» What makes you think I would give you the bread and water , and the meat that I cooked for my own servants ? I do not even know where you are from . «
The men returned to their camp and told David everything Nabal said .
David ordered : » Everyone get your swords ! « They strapped on their swords . Two hundred men stayed behind to guard the camp . The other four hundred followed David .
One of Nabal’s servants told Nabal’s wife Abigail : » Have you heard ? David sent some messengers from the wilderness with greetings for our master . He insulted them .
» Yet they were very good to us . They never bothered us . Nothing belonging to us was stolen at the time we were with them in the fields .
» They protected our sheep and us day and night the whole time we were with them .
» Consider what you should do because our master and his whole household are doomed . He is such a worthless man that it is useless to talk to him . «
So Abigail quickly took two hundred loaves of bread , two full wineskins , five butchered sheep , a bushel of roasted grain , one hundred bunches of raisins , and two hundred fig cakes and loaded them on donkeys .
» Lead the way , « she told her young men , » and I will follow you . « But she did not tell her husband Nabal about it .
She rode her donkey down a hidden mountain path . David and his men came to her .
David thought : » I guarded this man’s possessions in the desert for nothing ! Not one of his possessions was missing . Yet , he paid me back with evil when I was good to him .
» May God punish me if I do not kill every one of those men before morning ! «
Abigail saw David and quickly got down from her donkey . She immediately bowed down in front of David with her face touching the ground .
She fell at his feet and said : » Let me be held responsible for this wrong . Please let me speak with you . Please listen to me .
» You should not take this worthless person Nabal seriously . He is like his name . His name is Nabal Godless Fool . He is foolish . But I did not see the young men you sent .
» Jehovah kept you from spilling innocent blood and from getting a victory by your own efforts . As Jehovah lives and you live , may your enemies and those who are trying to harm you end up like Nabal .
» Please accept this gift from your maidservant . And give it to the young men who accompany my lord .
» Also please forgive the transgression of your maidservant . Jehovah will certainly give you a lasting dynasty , because my lord is fighting the battles of Jehovah . Evil will not be found in you all your days .
» Even if someone pursues you to take your life , your life is wrapped securely in the bundle purse bag of the living from Jehovah your God God will keep you safe . He will dispose of the lives of your enemies . They will be hurled like stones from a sling .
» When Jehovah does all the good he promised and makes you ruler of Israel ,
you should not have a troubled conscience because you spilled blood for no good reason and claimed your own victory . When Jehovah gives you success , remember me . «
David said to Abigail : » Blessed is Jehovah the God of Israel , who sent you today to meet me .
» Blessed is your good judgment and blessed are you for keeping me from slaughtering people today and from getting a victory by my own efforts .
» I solemnly promise as Jehovah the God of Israel lives that if you had not come to meet me Nabal would not have had one of his men alive at dawn . «
Then David accepted what she brought him . He said : » Go home in peace . I have listened to what you said and I grant your request . «
When Abigail came to Nabal , he was holding a banquet in his home . It was like a king’s banquet . He was in a good mood and very drunk , so she did not tell him anything until dawn .
In the morning after the effects of the wine wore off his wife told him what had happened . Nabal had a stroke . He could not move .
Ten days later Jehovah made him sicker and Nabal died .
David heard Nabal was dead . He said : » Blessed is Jehovah who defended me against the insults of Nabal . He kept me from doing wrong . Jehovah has turned Nabal’s own wickedness back on him . « David sent men on his behalf to propose marriage to Abigail .
David’s servants approached Abigail at Carmel . They told her : » David sent us to you to take you to him to be his wife . «
She bowed down with her face touching the ground . » I am ready to serve , « she said . » I am willing to wash the feet of my master’s servants . «
Abigail quickly got up and rode on a donkey with five of her female servants following her . So she went with David’s messengers and became his wife .
Earlier David married Ahinoam from the town of Jezreel . Now both she and Abigail were David’s wives .
Meanwhile , Saul arranged for Michal to marry Palti the son of Laish , who came from the town of Gallim .
Some people from Ziph went to Gibeah to talk with Saul , they said : » David has a hideout on Mount Hachilah near Jeshimon out in the desert . «
Saul went to the desert of Ziph . He took three thousand of Israel’s best-trained men to search for David .
Saul camped by the road at the hill of Hachilah near Jeshimon . David camped in the desert . He discovered that Saul come to the desert after him .
David sent spies to confirm Saul’s arrival .
Then David went to the place where Saul camped . David saw the place where Saul and Ner’s son Abner , the commander of the army , were lying . Saul was lying in the camp . The troops were camped around him .
David asked Ahimelech the Hittite , and Abishai the brother of Joab : » Who will go to Saul’s camp with me ? « » I will , « Abishai answered .
David and Abishai entered Saul’s camp at night . They found Saul sleeping in the center of the camp . His spear was stuck in the ground near his head . Abner and the troops were sleeping around him .
Abishai said to David : » God put your enemy in your power tonight . Let me plunge his own spear through him and pin him to the ground . I will do it with just one blow . I will not have to strike twice ! «
But David said : » Do not harm him ! Jehovah will certainly punish whoever harms his chosen king . «
» By the living God Jehovah , « David declared , » I know that Jehovah will kill Saul , either when his time comes to die a natural death or when he dies in battle .
» Jehovah forbid that I should try to harm the one Jehovah anointed to be king . Just take his spear and his water jar and go . «
David took the spear and the water jar from beside Saul’s head . Then he and Abishai left . No one saw it or knew what happened . No one woke up . They were all sound asleep , because Jehovah sent a heavy sleep on them all .
Then David crossed over to the other side of the valley . He went to the top of the hill a great distance away .
David shouted to Saul’s troops and to Abner : » Abner ! Can you hear me ? « » Who is calling to the king ? « Abner asked .
David answered , » Abner , are you the greatest man in Israel ? Why are you not protecting your master , the king ? Someone entered the camp to kill your master .
» You failed in your duty , Abner ! I swear by the living God Jehovah all of you deserve to die . You have not protected your master , whom Jehovah made king . Look for the king’s spear ? Where is the water jar that was near his head ? «
Saul recognized David’s voice and said : » Is that your voice my son David ? « And David said : » It is my voice , my lord the king .
He also said : » Why are you my lord pursuing your servant ? What have I done ? Or what evil is in my hand ?
» Please let my lord the king listen to the words of his servant . If Jehovah has stirred you up against me , let Him accept an offering . If it is men , cursed are they before Jehovah . They have driven me out today so that I would have no attachment with the inheritance of Jehovah , saying : ‘ Go serve other gods . ’ «
» Do not let my blood fall to the ground far from the presence of Jehovah . The king of Israel comes to search for a flea . Yet he hunts me down like a partridge on the mountains . «
» My servant David , « Saul said , » I have sinned . Come back . I will not harm you again . You valued my life today . I have acted like a fool . I made a terrible mistake . «
David answered : » Here is the king’s spear . Have one of your soldiers come and get it . «
» Jehovah put you in my power today . But you are his chosen king . I would not harm you . Jehovah rewards the righteous and faithful .
» I valued and saved your life today . I pray that you will value and save my life and that Jehovah will deliver me out of tribulation . «
Saul said : » David , my son , I pray that Jehovah will bless you and make you successful ! « Saul went back home . David also left .
David thought to himself : » One of these days Saul will kill me . The best thing for me to do is escape to Philistia . Saul will give up looking for me in Israel . Then I will be safe . «
David and his six hundred men went over at once to Achish son of Maoch , king of Gath .
David and his men and their families lived with Achish at Gath . David brought his two wives , Ahinoam the Jezreelitess , and Abigail of Carmel , the widow of Nabal .
Word soon reached Saul that David fled to Gath . So he stopped hunting for him .
David said to Achish : » If it is all right with you , let me live in one of the outlying towns . Why should I live in the royal city with you ? «
Achish immediately gave him Ziklag . This is why Ziklag still belongs to the kings of Judah today .
David lived in Philistine territory for one year and four months .
David and his men raided the Geshurites , the Girzites , and the Amalekites . Their territory extends from Telaim to Shur and Egypt .
David attacked the territory and left no man or woman alive . He also took sheep , cattle , donkeys , camels , and clothing and returned to Achish .
Achish would ask : » Whom did you raid today ? « David would answer : » The south country Negev in Judah , or the south country of the Jerahmeelites , or the south country of the Kenites . «
He did not bring a single man or woman back to Gath alive . He thought , they could tell Achish what I really did . This was his practice as long as he lived in Philistine territory .
Achish trusted David and thought : » David’s people must be furious with him . From now on he will have to take orders from me . «
One day the Philistines brought their soldiers together to attack Israel . Achish told David : » You and your men must fight as part of our Philistine army . «
David answered : » That will give you a chance to see for yourself just how well we can fight ! « Achish said : » You and your men will always be my bodyguards . «
After Samuel died all the Israelites mourned for him . They buried him in his hometown of Ramah . Saul forced all the fortunetellers and mediums to leave Israel .
The Philistine troops assembled and camped near the town of Shunem . Saul gathered the Israelites and camped at Mount Gilboa .
Saul was terrified when he saw the Philistine army .
So he asked Jehovah what to do . But Jehovah did not answer him . He did not answer by dreams or by the use of Urim and Thummim or by prophets .
Saul ordered his officials : » Find me a woman who is a medium . I will go and consult her . « » There is one in Endor , « they answered .
Saul disguised himself . He put on different clothes . After dark he went with two of his men to see the woman . » Consult the spirits for me and tell me what is going to happen , « he said to her : » Call up the spirit of the man I name . «
The woman answered : » You know what King Saul has done ? He forced the fortunetellers and mediums to leave Israel . Are you trying to trap me and get me killed ? «
Saul made a sacred vow . » By the living God Jehovah I promise that you will not be punished for doing this , « he told her .
» Whom shall I call up for you ? « The woman asked . » Samuel , « he answered .
The woman saw Samuel . She screamed and said to Saul , » Why have you tricked me ? You are King Saul ! «
» Do not be afraid ! « The king said to her . » What do you see ? « She answered : » I see a spirit coming up from the earth . «
» The spirit , what does it look like ? « He asked . » It is an old man , « she answered . » He wears a cloak . « Saul knew it was Samuel . So he bowed to the ground in respect .
Samuel said to Saul : » Why have you disturbed me ? Why did you make me come back ? « Saul answered : » I am in great trouble ! The Philistines are at war with me . God has abandoned me . He does not answer me any more by prophets or by dreams . Please tell me what to do . «
Samuel said : » Why do you call me when Jehovah has abandoned you and become your enemy ?
» Jehovah did to you what he told you through me . He took the kingdom away from you and gave it to David instead .
» You disobeyed Jehovah’s command and did not completely destroy the Amalekites . That is why Jehovah is doing this to you .
» He will give you and Israel over to the Philistines . Tomorrow you and your sons will join me . Jehovah will also give the army of Israel over to the Philistines . «
At once Saul fell down and lay stretched out on the ground . He was terrified by what Samuel said . He was weak because he had not eaten anything all day and all night .
The woman went to him . She saw that he was terrified . So she said to him : » I risked my life by doing what you asked .
» Now please do what I ask . Let me fix you some food . You must eat so that you will be strong enough to travel . «
Saul refused . He said he would not eat . But his officers also urged him to eat . He finally gave in , got up from the ground , and sat on the bed .
The woman quickly butchered a calf she had fattened . Then she took some flour and prepared it . She baked some bread without yeast .
She set the food before Saul and his officers and they ate . They left that same night .
The Philistines gathered all their troops at Aphek . The Israelites camped by the spring in Jezreel Valley .
The five Philistine kings marched with units of a hundred and of a thousand men . David and his men marched in the rear with King Achish .
The Philistine commanders saw them and asked : » What are these Hebrews doing here ? « Achish answered : » This is David . He is the man who ran away from King Saul of Israel . He has been with me for more than a year . He has done nothing I can find fault with since the day he came to me . «
The Philistine commanders were angry with Achish and said to him : » Send that fellow back to the town you gave him . Do not let him go into battle with us . He might turn against us during the fight . What better way is there for him to win back his master’s favor than by causing the death of our men ?
» This is David , the one about whom the women sang , as they danced : Saul has killed thousands , but David has killed tens of thousands . «
Achish called David and said : » I swear by the living God of Israel that you have been loyal to me . I would be pleased to have you go with me and fight in this battle . I have found no fault in you from the day you came to me . But the other kings do not approve of you .
» Go home in peace . Do not do anything that would displease them . «
David answered : » What have I done wrong ? As you say , you have not found any fault in me since the day I started serving you . Why should I not go with you , my master and king , and fight your enemies ? «
» I agree , « Achish replied . » I consider you as loyal as an angel of God . But the other kings say you may not go with us into battle .
» Tomorrow morning all of you who left Saul and came over to me must get up early and leave at first light . «
David and his men started out early the following morning . They went back to Philistia . The Philistines went on to Jezreel .
Two days later David and his men came to Ziklag . The Amalekites raided the south country Negev including Ziklag . They attacked Ziklag and burned it .
They captured the women young and old . However they killed no one . Instead , they took the women as prisoners .
When David and his men came to Zikleg they found it completely destroyed by fire . Their wives , sons , and daughters had been taken captive .
David and his men cried loudly until they did not have the strength to cry anymore .
The Amalekites also captured David’s two wives , Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail , Nabal’s widow , from Carmel .
The people in their bitterness said David should be stoned . This caused him great distress . They were thinking of their sons and daughters . But David found strength in Jehovah his God .
David told Abiathar the priest : » Please bring me the priestly ephod . « So Abiathar brought David the ephod .
David asked Jehovah : » Should I pursue these troops ? Will I catch up with them ? « » Pursue them ! « Jehovah told him : » You will certainly catch up with them and rescue the captives . «
So David and his six hundred men went to the Besor Valley , where some were left behind .
David and four hundred men went in pursuit . Two hundred men who were too exhausted to cross the Besor Valley stayed behind .
David’s men found an Egyptian in the open country and took him to David . They gave him food to eat and water to drink .
He also ate some dried figs , and two bunches of raisins . After he ate his strength returned . He had not eaten nor did he drank for three days .
» Who is your master ? Where are you from ? « David asked . » I am an Egyptian , the slave of an Amalekite , « he answered . » My master left me behind three days ago when I got sick .
» We raided the territory of the Cherethites in the southern part of Judah . We also raided the territory of the clan of Caleb , and we burned down Ziklag . «
» Will you lead me to those raiders ? « David asked him . He answered , » I will if you promise me in God’s name that you will not kill me or hand me over to my master . «
He led David to the Amalekites . They were eating , drinking and celebrating because of what they had taken from Philistia and Judah .
David attacked just before sunrise the next day . They fought until sunset . Four hundred Amalekites rode away on camels . They were the only ones to escape .
David rescued his two wives . They rescued everyone else the Amalekites captured at Ziklag .
Young and old , sons and daughters alike , no one was missing . David brought back everything that had been stolen .
They even brought back their livestock . David also took the sheep and cattle that the Amalekites had with them . He kept these separate from the others . Everyone agreed that these would be David’s reward .
On the way back , David met the two hundred men he left at Besor Gorge . They were too tired to keep up with him . They approached David and the people who were with him . He greeted the two hundred men and asked how they were doing .
Then every wicked and worthless man who had gone with David said : » Since they did not go with us , they should not be given any of the loot we recovered . Each of them should take only his wife and children and leave . «
David said : » My brothers , do not do that with the things Jehovah has given us . He kept us safe and helped us defeat the enemy .
» Besides , who is going to pay attention to what you have to say in this matter ? The share of those who go into battle must be like the share of those who stay with the supplies . They will all share alike . «
From that time on he made this a rule and a custom in Israel as it is to this day .
When David arrived in Ziklag , he sent some of the goods to the elders of Judah , and to his friends . He said : » Here is an offering for you from the spoil of those who fought against Jehovah . «
He sent the offering to the people in Bethel , to the people in Ramah in the southern part of Judah , and to the people in the towns of Jattir ,
Aroer , Siphmoth , Eshtemoa ,
and Racal ; to the clan of Jerahmeel , to the Kenites ,
and to the people in the towns of Hormah , Borashan , Athach ,
and Hebron . He sent it to all the places where he and his men had been .
When the Philistines fought Israel , the men of Israel fled from the Philistines and were killed in battle on Mount Gilboa .
The Philistines caught up to Saul and his sons . They killed Jonathan , Abinadab , and Malchishua , Saul’s sons .
The heaviest fighting was against Saul . When the archers got him in their range , he was badly wounded by them .
He said to the young man carrying his weapons : » Draw your sword and kill me . That way these godless Philistines will not gloat over me and kill me . « But the young man was too terrified to do it . So Saul took his own sword and threw himself on it .
The young man saw that Saul was dead . Then he too threw himself on his own sword and died with Saul .
That is how Saul , his three sons , and the young man died . All of Saul’s men died that day .
The Israelites on the other side of Jezreel Valley and east of the Jordan River heard that the Israelite army had fled and that Saul and his sons had been killed . They abandoned their towns and fled . Then the Philistines came and occupied the towns .
The next day the Philistines came to strip the dead . They found Saul and his three sons lying on Mount Gilboa .
They cut off his head and stripped off his armor . Then they sent men throughout Philistine territory to tell the people this good news in their idols’ temples .
They put his armor in the temple of their goddesses the Asherahs and fastened his corpse to the wall of Beth Shan .
The people living in Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul .
All the fighting men marched all night and took the dead bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beth Shan . They came back to Jabesh and burned the bodies .
They buried the bones under a small tree in Jabesh . Then for seven days , they went without eating to show their sorrow .
Saul was dead . David defeated the Amalekites and returned to Ziklag .
Three days later a soldier came from Saul’s army . His clothes were torn and dirt was on his head . He knelt down in front of David .
David asked : » Where did you come from ? « The man answered : » I escaped from Israel’s army . «
» How did the battle go ? « David asked . The man said : » Our army turned and ran . Many were wounded and died . King Saul and his son Jonathan are dead . «
David asked : » How do you know that Saul and Jonathan are dead ? «
He answered : » I was on Mount Gilboa . I saw Saul leaning on his spear . The chariots and cavalry of the enemy closed in on him .
» He looked my way and called me . I said : ‘ Yes here I am . ’ «
» He asked : ‘ Who are you . ’ ’ I told him I was an Amalekite .
» ‘ Then he said : ‘ Come here and kill me ! I am badly wounded and about to die . ’
» I went up to him and killed him . I knew that he would die anyway as soon as he fell . Then I took the crown from his head and the bracelet from his arm . Here , I have brought them to you . «
David and all his men tore their clothes in sorrow .
They grieved and mourned and fasted until evening for Saul and Jonathan and for Israel , the people of Jehovah , because so many had been killed in battle .
David asked the young man who brought him the news : » Where are you from ? « He answered : » I am an Amalekite , son of a foreign resident . «
David asked : » Why were you not afraid to take it upon yourself to destroy Jehovah’s anointed king ? «
David called one of the young men and said : » Execute him ! « So he struck him and he died .
David said to him : » Your blood is on your head . Your mouth has testified against you . For you admit that you killed Jehovah’s anointed . «
Then David chanted with a lament dirge requiem over Saul and Jonathan his son .
He told them to teach the sons of Judah the song of the bow . It is written in the book of Jashar :
» Your beauty , O Israel , is slain on your high places ! How the mighty have fallen !
» Do not tell the news in Gath . Do not announce the victory in the streets of Ashkelon . The daughters of the Philistines will be glad . The daughters of godless men will celebrate .
» Let no rain or dew fall on the mountains of Gilboa . Let its fields be barren ! For the shields of the mighty lie there in disgrace . The shield of Saul is no longer polished with oil .
» Jonathan’s bow was deadly . The sword of Saul was without mercy . He struck down the mighty and killed the enemy .
» It was easy to love Saul and Jonathan . Together in life , together in death , they were faster than eagles and stronger than lions .
» Daughters of Israel , weep over Saul . He clothed you in scarlet with luxury .
» The brave soldiers have fallen . They were killed in battle . Jonathan lies dead in the hills .
» I grieve for you , my brother Jonathan . You were dear to me ! How wonderful was your love for me . It was better than the love of women .
» The mighty have fallen , their weapons abandoned and useless . «
Later David asked Jehovah : » Shall I go to the towns of Judah ? « » Yes , « Jehovah answered . » Which one ? « David asked . » Hebron , « Jehovah told him .
David went to Hebron . He took his two wives : Ahinoam from Jezreel , and Abigail , Nabal’s widow from Carmel with him .
He also took his men and their families . They settled in the towns around Hebron .
Then the men of Judah came to Hebron . They anointed David as king of Judah . David heard that the people of Jabesh-gilead Jabesh in Gilead buried Saul .
He sent some men there with the message : » Jehovah blesses you for showing your loyalty to your king by burying him .
» May Jehovah always show you kindness . I also will be good to you because you did this .
» Be strong and courageous . Your master Saul is dead . Therefore the tribe of Judah has anointed me to be their king . «
Ner’s son Abner , commander of Saul’s army , took Saul’s son Ishbosheth and brought him to Mahanaim .
Abner made him king of Gilead , Asher , Jezreel , Ephraim , and Benjamin , that is , all Israel .
Saul’s son Ishbosheth was forty years old when he became king of Israel . He ruled for two years . However the tribe of Judah followed David .
In Hebron David was king over the tribe of Judah for seven years and six months .
One time Abner and the soldiers of Ishbosheth left Mahanaim and went to Gibeon .
At that time Joab the son of Zeruiah was leading David’s soldiers . The two groups met at the pool in Gibeon . Abner and his men sat down on one side of the pool and Joab and his men sat on the other side .
Abner yelled to Joab : » Let some of our best soldiers get up and fight each other ! « Joab agreed .
Twelve of Ishbosheth’s men from the tribe of Benjamin got up to fight twelve of David’s men .
Each one grabbed his opponent by the head . Then he stuck his sword into his opponent’s side , and they fell down together . That place in Gibeon is called the Field of Enemies .
Fierce fighting broke out that day . In the end , David’s men defeated Abner and the men of Israel .
Zeruiah’s three sons were there : Joab , Abishai , and Asahel . Asahel was as fast on his feet as a wild gazelle .
So Asahel started chasing Abner . He ran straight for him .
Abner looked behind and asked : » Are you Asahel ? « He answered : » I am . «
Abner said : » Soldiers are all around us . Stop chasing me and fight one of them ! Kill him and take his clothes and weapons for yourself . « But Asahel refused to stop .
Abner spoke again to Asahel : » If you do not turn back , I will have to kill you ! Then I could never face your brother Joab again . «
However , Asahel would not turn back . So Abner struck him in the stomach with the back end of his spear . The spear went all the way through and came out of his back . Asahel fell down and died . Everyone who saw Asahel lying dead just stopped and stood still .
Joab and Abishai ran after Abner . It was sun down when they arrived at the hill of Ammah . This hill is near Giah on the road to the wilderness of Gibeon .
The men of Benjamin rallied behind Abner . They became united as one and stood on the top of a hill .
Then Abner called to Joab : Must the sword devour forever ? Do you not understand it will be bitter to the end ? How long before you command the people to return from chasing their brothers ?
Joab said : » As God lives ; if you had not spoken the men would have continued following their brothers . «
So Joab blew a ram’s horn and all the troops stopped . They did not chase or fight Israel anymore .
That night Abner and his men marched through the plains . They crossed the Jordan River and passed through the entire Bithron until they came to Mahanaim .
Joab returned from chasing Abner . He gathered the troops . Nineteen of David’s officers and Asahel were missing .
David’s men killed three hundred and sixty of the men of Benjamin under Abner’s command .
They buried Asahel in his father’s tomb in Bethlehem . Joab and his men marched all night . They arrived at Hebron at daybreak .
There was a long war between the royal families of Saul and David . David’s family became stronger and stronger . Saul’s family became weaker and weaker .
Sons were born to David while he was in Hebron . His first son was Amnon , born to Ahinoam from Jezreel .
The second was Chileab , whose mother was Abigail , Nabal’s widow from Carmel . The third was Absalom , whose mother was Maacah daughter of King Talmai of Geshur .
The fourth son was Adonijah , whose mother was Haggith . The fifth was Shephatiah , whose mother was Abital .
The sixth was Ithream , whose mother was Eglah . All of these sons were born in Hebron .
The fighting continued between David’s forces and the forces loyal to Saul’s family . Abner became more and more powerful among Saul’s followers .
Saul had a concubine named Rizpah . She was Aiah’s daughter . Ishbosheth asked Abner : » Why did you have sex with my father’s concubine ? «
Ishbosheth’s question made Abner very angry . » Am I a dog that belongs to Judea ? « He asked . » Until now I have been faithful to your father Saul’s family , to his relatives and friends . I did not hand you over to David . But now you charge me with a crime because of this woman .
» May God deal with me harshly if I do not help David get all that Jehovah promised him when he said :
» ‘ I Jehovah will transfer the kingship from Saul’s family and establish David’s throne over Israel and Judah from Dan to Beersheba . ’ «
Ishbosheth could not respond to a single word for he was afraid of Abner .
Abner sent messengers to David to speak on his behalf . » Who owns this country ? « He asked . » Make an agreement with me , « he said . » Then I will support you and bring all Israel to you . «
» Good ! « David answered . » I will make an agreement with you . But there is one condition : You may not come to see me unless you bring Michal , Saul’s daughter , when you come . «
David sent messengers to Ishbosheth to give him this message : » Give me back my wife Michal ! I bought her for the price of a hundred Philistine foreskins . «
Ishbosheth sent some of his men to take Michal away from her new husband , Paltiel son of Laish .
Paltiel followed Michal and the men all the way to Bahurim . He cried all the way . But he went back home after Abner ordered him to leave .
Meanwhile , Abner communicated with the leaders of Israel : » For some time now you wanted to make David your king .
» Do it now ! This is what Jehovah said about David : ‘ I will save my people Israel from the Philistines and all their other enemies through my servant David . ’ «
Abner also spoke to the people of Benjamin . Then Abner went directly to David in Hebron . He told him everything Israel and the entire tribe of Benjamin had approved .
Twenty men accompanied Abner to see David at Hebron . David had a feast for Abner and his men .
Abner told David : » I must go now so that I can gather all Israel for you , Your Majesty . They will make an agreement with you . You will rule over all that your heart desires . « Then David dismissed Abner , who left peacefully .
Just then David’s men and Joab came home from a raid with a lot of plunder . Abner had been dismissed , so he was no longer with David in Hebron .
Joab came back with the whole army . He was told : » Ner’s son Abner came to the king . However David dismissed him and Abner left peacefully . «
Joab went to the king and asked : » What have you done ? Abner came to see you . Why did you send him away ?
» Surely you know that he came to deceive you . He came to find out everything you do and everywhere you go . «
Joab left David . Then he sent messengers to get Abner , and they brought him back from Sirah Well . David knew nothing about it .
Abner arrived in Hebron . Joab took him aside at the gate , as though he wanted to speak privately with him . There he stabbed him in the stomach . So Abner was murdered because he had killed Joab’s brother Asahel .
When David heard the news , he said : » Jehovah knows that my subjects and I are completely innocent of the murder of Abner .
» Let the punishment for it fall on Joab and all his family ! In every generation may there be some man in his family who has gonorrhea or a dreaded skin disease or is fit only to do a woman’s work or is killed in battle or does not have enough to eat ! «
Joab and his brother Abishai took revenge and murdered Abner for killing their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon .
David told Joab and everyone with him : » Show your sorrow by tearing your clothes and wearing sackcloth ! Walk in front of Abner’s body and cry ! « David walked behind the coffin on which Abner’s body was being carried .
Abner was buried in Hebron . David and everyone else stood at the tomb and cried loudly .
The king sang a funeral song for Abner : » Should Abner die like a godless fool ? «
» Your hands were not bound . Your feet were not in fetters . You fell as one falls in front of wicked men . And all the people continued to cry for him . «
David refused to eat anything the day of the funeral even though people tried to persuade him to eat . David vowed : » May God strike me dead if I taste any food or anything else before the sun goes down . «
All the people understood and approved of everything the king did .
That day all the people of Israel knew the king was not responsible for killing Ner’s son Abner .
The king told his officers : » Do you not know that today a leader , a great man , has fallen in Israel ?
» Today , even though I am the anointed king , these men , Zeruiah’s sons , are too strong for me to control . May Jehovah repay these wicked men , as their evil deed deserves . «
Saul’s son Ishbosheth heard that Abner had died in Hebron . He lost his courage , and all Israel was alarmed .
Saul’s son had two men who were captains of raiding parties . One was named Baanah , and the other was named Rechab . They were the sons of Rimmon from Beeroth from the tribe of Benjamin . Beeroth was considered a part of Benjamin .
The people of Beeroth fled to Gittaim . They still live there today .
Saul’s son Jonathan had a son who was crippled . When the boy was five years old , the news about the death of Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel . His nurse picked him up and fled to Gittaim . She was in a hurry when she left . He fell from her arms and became disabled . His name was Mephibosheth .
Rechab and Baanah went to Ishbosheth’s house at the noontime . It was a hot day , and he was resting .
They came to the middle of the house pretending to get wheat . Once they were inside they stabbed Ishbosheth in the stomach and killed him .
They cut off his head and took his head with them . They traveled by way of the Arabah all night .
They took the head of Ishbosheth to David at Hebron and said to the king , » Here is the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul , your enemy , who sought your life . Jehovah has given my lord the king vengeance this day on Saul and his descendants . «
David responded to Rechab and his brother Baanah , the sons of Rimmon from Beeroth :
» I once seized a man who told me that Saul had died . He thought he was bringing good news . I killed him in Ziklag to reward him for his news .
» How much more should I reward wicked men who kill an innocent man on his own bed in his home ? Jehovah has rescued me from every trouble . I solemnly swear , as Jehovah lives , I will now seek revenge for his murder and rid the land of you . «
David gave the order for his soldiers to kill Rechab and Baanah and cut off their hands and feet . They killed them and hung their hands and feet near the pool in Hebron . They took Ishbosheth’s head and buried it in Abner’s tomb there at Hebron .
All the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said to him : » We are your own flesh and blood .
» For a long time when Saul was still our king , you led the people of Israel in battle . Jehovah promised you that you would lead his people and be their ruler . «
All the elders of Israel came to King David at Hebron . He made a sacred alliance with them . They anointed him , and he became king of Israel .
David was thirty years old when he became king . He ruled for forty years .
In Hebron he ruled Judah for seven years and six months . In Jerusalem he ruled for thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah .
The king and his men went to Jerusalem to attack the Jebusites , who lived in that region . The Jebusites told David : » You will never get in here . Even the blind and the lame could turn you away . In other words he could not enter there . «
However , David captured the fortress Zion , that is , the City of David .
That day David said : » Whoever wants to defeat the Jebusites must reach the lame and the blind that hate me by using the water tunnel . « So there is a saying : » The blind and the lame will not get into the palace . «
David lived in the fortress and called it the City of David . He built the city of Jerusalem around it from the stronghold citadel to the palace .
David continued to grow more powerful because Jehovah God of Hosts was with him .
King Hiram of Tyre sent some officials to David . Carpenters and stone workers came with them . They brought cedar logs so they could build a palace for David .
David knew that Jehovah made him king of Israel and that he had made him a powerful ruler for the good of his people .
David left Hebron and moved to Jerusalem . He married many women from Jerusalem , and he had a lot of children .
The following are the names of his sons born in Jerusalem : Shammua , Shobab , Nathan , Solomon ,
Ibhar , Elishua , Nepheg , Japhia ,
Elishama , Eliada , and Eliphelet .
The Philistines heard that David was now king of Israel . They mobilized all their forces to capture him . But David found out and went into his fortress .
So the Philistines camped in Rephaim Valley .
David asked Jehovah : » Shall I attack the Philistines ? Will you hand them over to me ? « Jehovah answered David : » Attack ! I will certainly deliver the Philistines to you . «
David went to Baal Perazim and defeated the Philistines . He said : » Jehovah has overwhelmed my enemies in front of me like an overwhelming flood . « That is why that place is called Baal Perazim Master of Breaking Through
The Philistines left their idols there . David and his men carried them all away .
The Philistines again attacked and overran the valley of Rephaim .
Once again David consulted Jehovah . Jehovah answered David : » Do not attack them from here . Go around and get ready to attack them from the other side , near the balsam trees .
» Attack when you hear the sound of marching in the treetops . I will be marching ahead of you to defeat the Philistine army . «
David did what Jehovah commanded . He drove the Philistines back from Geba all the way to Gezer .
Once again David called together the best soldiers in Israel , a total of thirty thousand men .
He led them to Baalah in Judah , in order to bring the Ark of the Covenant bearing the name of Jehovah of Hosts , whose throne is above the winged creatures .
They took it from Abinadab’s home on the hill and placed it on a new cart . Uzzah and Ahio , sons of Abinadab , were guiding the cart .
Ahio walked in front .
David and all the Israelites danced and sang with all their might to honor Jehovah . They played harps , lyres , drums , tambourines , rattles , and cymbals .
As they came to the threshing place of Nacon , the oxen stumbled , and Uzzah reached out and took hold of the Ark of the Covenant .
At once Jehovah God became angry with Uzzah . He killed him because of his irreverence . Uzzah died there beside the Ark of the Covenant .
Because of that the place has been called Perez Uzzah breakthrough of Uzzah ever since . David was furious because Jehovah punished Uzzah in anger .
Then David was afraid of Jehovah and said : » How can I take the Ark of the Covenant with me now ? «
So he decided not to take it with him to Jerusalem . Instead , he turned off the road and took it to the house of Obed Edom , a native of the city of Gath .
The Ark of Jehovah stayed at the home of Obed Edom from Gath for three months . Jehovah blessed Obed Edom and his whole family .
King David was told : » Jehovah has blessed Obed Edom’s home and everything he owns because of the Ark of God . « Then David joyfully went to get the Ark of God from Obed Edom’s house and bring it to the City of David .
When those who carried the Ark of Jehovah walked six steps , David sacrificed a bull and a fattened calf .
Wearing a linen ephod , David danced in Jehovah’s presence with all his might .
He and the entire nation of Israel brought the Ark of Jehovah with shouts of joy and the sounding of rams’ horns .
When the Ark of Jehovah came to the City of David , Saul’s daughter Michal looked out of a window and saw King David leaping and dancing in Jehovah’s presence . She despised him in her heart .
The men carrying the Ark set it in its place inside the tent David put up for it . David sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings in Jehovah’s presence .
David finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and the fellowship offerings . Then he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah of Hosts .
He also distributed to all the people , to the whole crowd of Israelites , men and women , one loaf of bread , one date cake , and one raisin cake . Then all the people went home .
David went home so he could ask Jehovah to bless his family . But Saul’s daughter Michal went out and started yelling at him : » You were really great today ! « She said . » You acted like a dirty old man . You danced around half-naked in front of your servants’ slave-girls . «
David answered : » I danced to honor Jehovah . He chose me to be king instead of your father and his family . He made me the leader of his people Israel . I will continue to dance and honor Jehovah .
» I will disgrace myself even more . You may think I am nothing , but those women think highly of me ! «
Michal , Saul’s daughter , never had any children .
King David was settled in his palace . Jehovah kept him safe from all his enemies .
The king said to the prophet Nathan : » I live in a house built of cedar . Yet the Ark of God is kept in a tent ! «
Nathan answered : » Do what you have in mind . Jehovah is with you . «
That night Jehovah said to Nathan ,
» Go tell my servant David that I say to him : ‘ You are not the one to build a temple for me to live in .
» From the time I rescued the people of Israel from Egypt until now , I have never lived in a temple . I have traveled around living in a tent .
» In all my traveling with the people of Israel I never asked any of the leaders that I appointed why they had not built me a temple made of cedar . ’ «
» Say this to my servant David : ‘ This is what Jehovah of Hosts says : I took you from the pasture where you followed sheep so that you could be the leader of my people Israel .
» ‘ I was with you wherever you went . I destroyed all your enemies in front of you . I will make your name famous like the names of the greatest people on earth .
» ‘ I will make a place for my people Israel and plant them there . They will dwell in their own place and not be troubled anymore . The wicked will not oppress them as they used to do
when I let judges rule my people . I have kept your enemies from attacking you . Now I promise that you and your descendants will be kings .
» ‘ I will choose one of your sons to be king when you reach the end of your life and are buried in the tomb of your ancestors . I will make him a strong ruler .
» ‘ I will allow no one to take his long lasting kingdom away from him . He will be the one to build a temple for me .
» ‘ I will be his father . He will be my son . When he does wrong I will correct him just as parents correct children .
» ‘ I will never put an end to my agreement with him . I put an end to my agreement with Saul when he was king before you .
» ‘ I will make sure that one of your descendants will be king for a very long time . Your throne will be established from generation to generation . ’ «
Nathan told David exactly what he heard in the vision .
David went into the tent he set up for the ark . Then he sat there and prayed : » Jehovah All-Powerful , my family and I do not deserve what you have already done for us .
» Yet this was insignificant in your eyes , O Sovereign Lord Jehovah for you have spoken also of your servant’s house in the distant future . And this is the law for man , O Sovereign Lord Jehovah .
» What more can David say to you ? For you know your servant , O Sovereign Lord Jehovah .
» For the sake of your Word and according to your will you have done this great thing . You have made it known to your servant !
» For this reason you are great , O Sovereign Lord Jehovah . There is none like you . There is no God besides you according to all that we have heard with our ears .
» There is no other nation on earth like Israel . This is the nation you rescued from slavery in Egypt to be your own . You became famous by using great and wonderful miracles to force other nations and their gods out of your land , so your people could live here .
» You chose Israel to be your people from generation to generation ! You have become their God .
» And now , Jehovah God , please do what you have promised .
» You will be famous for a very long time ! Everyone will say : » Jehovah of Hosts rules Israel . David’s descendants are his chosen kings .
» Now therefore , may it please you to bless the house of your servant that it may continue a long time before you . You O Lord Jehovah have spoken . May the house of your servant be blessed from generation to generation .
» Lord Jehovah , you are God . You have promised me some very good things , and you can be trusted to do what you promise .
» Please bless my descendants and let them be your chosen kings for a very long time . You have already promised , and I am sure that you will bless my family from generation to generation . «
King David attacked the Philistines again . He defeated them and ended their control over Methegammah .
He defeated the Moabites . He made the prisoners lie down on the ground and put two out of every three of them to death . So the Moabites became his subjects and paid taxes to him .
David defeated the king of the Syrian state of Zobah , Hadadezer son of Rehob . Hadadezer was on his way to restore his control over the territory by the upper Euphrates River .
David captured seventeen hundred of his cavalry and twenty thousand of his foot soldiers . He kept enough horses for a hundred chariots and crippled hamstrung all the rest .
The Syrians of Damascus sent an army to help King Hadadezer . David attacked it and killed twenty-two thousand men .
Then he set up military camps in their territory . They became his subjects and paid taxes to him . Jehovah made David victorious everywhere .
David captured the gold shields carried by Hadadezer’s officials and took them to Jerusalem .
King David also took a large quantity of copper from Betah and Berothai , Hadadezer’s cities .
Soon King Toi of Hamath heard that David had defeated Hadadezer’s entire army .
He sent his son Joram to greet King David and congratulate him for fighting and defeating Hadadezer . There had often been war between Hadadezer and Toi . Joram brought articles of gold , silver , and copper with him .
King David dedicated these articles to Jehovah , along with the silver and gold he dedicated from all the nations he conquered .
These nation included : Edom , Moab , Ammon , the Philistines , Amalek , and from the goods taken from Zobah’s King Hadadezer , son of Rehob .
David made a name for himself by killing eighteen thousand Edomites in the Dead Sea region as he returned to Jerusalem .
He put troops everywhere in Edom . All the Edomites were David’s subjects . Everywhere David went Jehovah gave him victories .
So David ruled all Israel . He did what was fair and right for all his people .
Joab the son of Zeruiah was the commander in chief of the army . Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud kept the government records .
Zadok the son of Ahitub , and Abiathar the son of Ahimelech , were the priests . Seraiah was the secretary .
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was the commander of David’s bodyguard . David’s sons were priests .
One day , David thought : » I wonder if any of Saul’s family is still alive . If they are I will be kind to them . This is because I made a promise to Jonathan . «
There was a servant of Saul’s family named Ziba . He was told to go to David . » Are you Ziba ? « The king asked . » I am at your service . « He answered .
The king asked him : » Is there anyone left of Saul’s family to whom I can show loyalty and kindness ? I promised God I would . « Ziba answered : » There is still one of Jonathan’s sons . He is crippled . «
» Where is he ? « The king asked . Ziba answered : » At the home of Machir son of Ammiel in Lodebar . «
King David sent for him .
Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan and grandson of Saul arrived . He bowed down before David in respect . David said : » Mephibosheth . « He answered : » I am here to serve . «
David replied : » Do not be afraid . I will be kind to you for the sake of your father Jonathan . I will give you back all the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul . You will always be welcome at my table . «
Mephibosheth bowed again and said : » I am no better than a dead dog ! Why should you be so good to me ? «
The king called Ziba , Saul’s servant , and said : » I am giving Mephibosheth , your master’s grandson , everything that belonged to Saul and his family .
» You , your sons , and your servants will farm the land for your master Saul’s family and bring in the harvest . This will provide food for them . Mephibosheth will always be a guest at my table . « Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants .
Ziba answered : » I will do everything Your Majesty commands . « So Mephibosheth ate at the king’s table , just like one of the king’s sons .
Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Mica . Everyone who lived at Ziba’s home became Mephibosheth’s servant .
Mephibosheth was disabled . He lived in Jerusalem . He always ate at the king’s table .
Later the king of Ammon died . His son Hanun became king in his place .
David thought : » I will show kindness to Hanun since his father Nahash showed me kindness . « David sent his servants to comfort Hanun after his father’s death . When David’s servants entered Ammonite territory ,
the Ammonite princes asked their master Hanun : » Do you think David is honoring your father because he sent men to comfort you ? Perhaps David sent his men to explore the city , spy on it , and destroy it . «
Hanun seized David’s men and shaved off half of each man’s beard . He cut off their clothes from the waist down , and sent them away .
David was told what happened . He sent someone to meet them because they were deeply humiliated . The king said to them : » Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown back . Then return to Jerusalem . «
The Ammonites realized they had made themselves repulsive to David . They hired the Arameans from Beth Rehob and Zobah , with twenty thousand foot soldiers . From the army of the king of Maacah they hired one thousand men , and twelve thousand men of Tob .
After David heard about this , he sent Joab and all the elite troops .
The Ammonites formed a battle line at the entrance of the city gate . The Arameans from Zobah and Rehob and the men from Tob and Maacah remained by themselves in the open country .
Joab saw he was under attack in front and behind . He took the select troops of Israel and organized them for combat against the Arameans .
He put his brother Abishai in command of the rest of the army and had them fight the Ammonites .
Joab told his brother : » If the Arameans are too much for me to handle , you can come and help me . If the Ammonites are too strong for you , I will come and help you .
» Be brave and fight hard to protect our people and the cities of our God . I pray that Jehovah will do whatever pleases him . «
Joab and his men advanced to attack the Syrians . The Syrians retreated .
The Ammonites saw the Syrians Arameans running away . They fled from Abishai and retreated into the city . Then Joab turned back from fighting the Ammonites and went back to Jerusalem .
The Syrians knew they had been defeated by the Israelites . They called all their troops together .
King Hadadezer sent for the Syrians Arameans who were on the east side of the Euphrates River . They came to Helam under the command of Shobach , commander of the army of King Hadadezer of Zobah .
David heard of it . So he gathered the Israelite troops and crossed the Jordan River . They marched to Helam , where the Syrians took up their position facing him . The fighting began ,
and the Israelites drove the Syrian army back . David and his men killed seven hundred Syrian chariot drivers and forty thousand cavalry . They wounded Shobach , the enemy commander , who died on the battlefield .
As soon as the kings who were subject to Hadadezer realized that they had been defeated by the Israelites , they made peace with them and became their subjects . The Syrians were afraid to help the Ammonites any more .
In the spring , at the time of the year when kings usually go to war , David sent out Joab with his officers and the Israelite army . They destroyed the Ammonites and besieged the city of Rabbah . David stayed in Jerusalem .
Late one afternoon , David got up from his nap and went to the palace roof . He walked around on the roof . He saw a woman taking a bath . She was very beautiful .
He sent a messenger to find out who she was . He learned that she was Bathsheba , the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite .
So David sent messengers to get her . She came to him and they had sexual intercourse . She had just cleansed herself after her monthly period . Then she went home .
The woman became pregnant . So she sent someone to tell David that she was pregnant .
David sent a messenger to Joab , saying : » Send me Uriah the Hittite . « So Joab sent Uriah to David .
When Uriah arrived , David asked him how Joab and the troops were and how the war was going .
» Go home , « David said to Uriah , » and wash your feet . « Uriah left the royal palace , and the king sent a present to him .
But Uriah slept at the entrance of the royal palace among his superior’s mercenaries . He did not go home .
Someone told David that Uriah did not go home . So the next morning David asked him : » Why did you not go home ? Have you been away for a long time ? «
Uriah answered : » The Ark of the Covenant and the armies of Israel and Judah are camping out somewhere in the fields with our commander Joab and his officers and troops . Do you think I would go home to eat and drink and sleep with my wife ? I swear by your life that I would not ! «
David said : » Stay here in Jerusalem and I will send you back tomorrow . « Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next day .
David invited him for dinner . Uriah ate with David and drank so much that he got drunk . However he still did not go home . He went out and slept on his mat near the palace guards .
The next morning , David wrote a letter and told Uriah to deliver it to Joab .
The letter said : » Put Uriah on the front line where the fighting is the worst . Pull the troops back from him , so that he will be wounded and die . «
Joab carefully watched the city of Rabbah . He put Uriah in a place where he knew there were some of the enemy’s best soldiers .
The men of the city came out and fought Joab . Some of David’s mercenaries fell and died . This included Uriah the Hittite .
Joab sent a messenger to report to David all the details of the battle .
And he commanded the messenger : » When you finish telling the king about the battle ,
the king may become angry . He might ask you : ‘ Why did you go so close to the city to fight ? Did you not know they would shoot from the wall ? ’
» Who killed Jerubbesheth’s son Abimelech ? Did a woman on the wall of Thebez throw a small millstone at him and kill him ? Why did you go so close to the wall ? If the king asks this , tell him : ‘ Your man Uriah the Hittite is also dead . ’ «
The messenger left . When he arrived he reported to David everything Joab told him to say .
The messenger said to David : » Their men overpowered us when they came to attack us in the field . Then we forced them back to the entrance of the city gate .
» The archers on the wall shot down at your mercenaries . Some of Your Majesty’s mercenaries died . Your man Uriah the Hittite also is dead . «
David replied : » This is what you are to say to Joab : ‘ Do not let this thing trouble you . After all a sword can kill one person as easily as another . Strengthen your attack against the city , and destroy it . Say this to encourage him . ’ «
Uriah’s wife heard that her husband was dead and she mourned for him .
When her mourning was over , David sent for her and brought her to his home . She became his wife . Then she gave birth to a son . However , Jehovah considered David’s actions evil .
Jehovah sent Nathan to David . Nathan came to him and said : » There were two men in a certain city . One was rich and the other was poor .
» The rich man had a very large number of sheep and cattle .
But the poor man had only one little female lamb that he bought . He raised her , and she grew up in his home with his children . She would eat his food and drink from his cup . She rested in his arms and was like a daughter to him .
» Now , a visitor came to the rich man . The rich man thought it would be a pity to take one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler . So he took the poor man’s lamb and prepared it for the traveler . «
David became very angry with the rich man . He said : » I swear by the living God Jehovah that the man who did this should die !
» For doing such a cruel thing he should pay back four times for the lamb he took , for he had no compassion . «
» You are that man ! « Nathan said to David . » And this is what the Lord Jehovah the God of Israel says : ‘ I made you king of Israel and rescued you from Saul .
» ‘ I gave you his kingdom and his wives . Then I made you king over Israel and Judah . If this had not been enough , I would have given you twice as much .
» ‘ Why have you disobeyed my commands ? Why did you do this evil thing ? You had Uriah killed in battle ! You let the Ammonites kill him . Then you took his wife !
» ‘ In every generation some of your descendants will die a violent death because you have disobeyed me and have taken Uriah’s wife .
» ‘ I swear to you that I will cause someone from your own family to bring trouble to you . You will see it when I take your wives from you and give them to another man . He will have intercourse with them in broad daylight .
» ‘ You did this secretly . I will make this happen in broad daylight in front of all Israel . ’ «
David said to Nathan : » I have sinned against Jehovah . « Nathan replied : » Jehovah has taken away your sin . You will not die .
» You have shown total contempt for Jehovah by this affair . Therefore the son that is born to you must die . «
Nathan went home . Jehovah struck the child that Uriah’s wife had given birth to David . The child became sick .
David pleaded with God for the child . He fasted and lay on the ground all night .
The elders in his palace stood beside him to raise him up from the ground . But he was unwilling and he would not eat with them .
On the seventh day the child died . David’s servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead . They thought : » While the child was alive , we talked to him , and he would not listen to us . How can we tell him the child is dead ? He may harm himself . «
David saw that his servants were whispering to one another . He realized discerned that the child was dead . » Is the child dead ? « David asked them . » Yes , he is dead . « They answered .
David got up from the floor . He took a bath , combed his hair , and changed his clothes . Then he went and worshiped in the Temple of Jehovah . After that he returned to the palace and ate .
» We do not understand , « his servants said , » while the child was alive you would not eat . As soon as he died , you got up and ate ! «
David replied : » I fasted and cried while the child lived . I thought Jehovah might be gracious to me and let the child live .
» Why should I fast now that he is dead ? Can I bring him back ? Someday I will go to him . However he will not come back to me . «
David comforted his wife Bathsheba . He went to bed with her , and she later gave birth to a son . David named him Solomon . Jehovah loved the child .
He sent a message through the prophet Nathan to name the baby Jedidiah Jehovah’s Beloved .
Meanwhile , Joab fought against the Ammonite city of Rabbah and captured its royal fortress .
He sent messengers to tell David : » I fought against Rabbah and captured the fortress guarding its water supply .
» Assemble the rest of the troops . Surround the city and capture it . Otherwise I will capture the city . Then it will be named after me . «
David assembled the rest of the army and attacked Rabbah . He captured the city .
He removed the crown of their god Milcom from off the head of their king . The crown was made of seventy-five pounds of gold . There was a valuable jewel on it . David put the jewel on his own crown . He also carried off everything else of value .
David made the people of Rabbah tear down the city walls with iron picks and axes . He also put them to work making bricks . He did the same thing with all the other Ammonite cities . David went back to Jerusalem . The people of Israel returned to their homes .
David had a beautiful daughter named Tamar . She was Absalom’s sister . She was also the half sister of Amnon . Amnon fell in love with her .
Tamar was a virgin . Amnon could not think of a way to be alone with her . He was so upset about it that he made himself sick .
Amnon had a friend named Jonadab . He was the son of David’s brother Shimeah . Jonadab usually knew how to get what he wanted .
Jonadab said to Amnon : » You are the king’s son . Even so day after day I see you looking sad . What is the problem ? « Amnon answered : » I am in love with Tamar , the sister of my half brother Absalom . «
Jonadab said : » Pretend that you are sick and go to bed . When your father comes to see you , say to him : ‘ Please ask my sister Tamar to come and feed me . I want her to fix the food here where I can see her . Then she can serve it to me . ’ «
So Amnon went to bed and pretended that he was sick . King David went to see him . Amnon said : » Please have Tamar come and make a few cakes here where I can see her . Then she can serve them to me . «
David sent word to Tamar at the palace : » Go to Amnon’s house and fix him some food . «
She went there and found him in bed . She prepared dough and made some cakes there where he could see her . Then she baked the cakes .
Tamar emptied them out of the pan for him to eat . But he refused to eat . He said : Send everyone away . So they all left .
He said to her : » Bring the cakes here to my bed and serve them to me . « She took the cakes and went over to him .
She offered them to him . He grabbed her and said : » Come to bed with me ! «
She said : » No ! Do not force me to do this disgraceful thing . It is evil .
» How could I ever hold up my head in public again ? And you , you would be completely disgraced in Israel . Please speak to the king . I am sure he will give me to you . «
Amnon wouldn ’ t listen to her . He grabbed his sister and raped her .
After that Amnon developed an intense hatred for her . His hatred for her was greater than the lust he felt for her . » Get out of here , « he told her .
She said : » No , You do a greater wrong by sending me away than the other thing you did to me ! « He would not listen to her .
He called his servant and said : » Throw this woman out and lock the door ! «
The servant forced her to leave . He locked the door behind her . The king’s unmarried daughters used to wear long robes with sleeves .
Tamar tore the robe she was wearing . She put ashes on her head . Then she covered her face with her hands . She cried loudly as she walked away .
Tamar’s brother Absalom said to her : » How could Amnon have done such a terrible thing to you ! But since he is your brother , do not tell anyone what happened . Just try not to think about it . « Tamar soon moved into Absalom’s house . She was always sad and lonely .
King David heard what happened and he was furious !
Absalom hated Amnon so much because he raped his sister Tamar . He would not speak to him anymore .
Two years later Absalom had sheep sheared at Baal Hazor , near the town of Ephraim . He invited all the king’s sons to be there .
He went to King David and said : » Your Majesty , I am having my sheep sheared . Will you and your officials take part in the festivities ? «
The king answered : No , my son . It would be too much trouble for you if we all went . Absalom insisted , but the king would not give in . So he asked Absalom to leave .
Absalom said : » Will you at least let my brother Amnon come ? Why should he ? « The king asked .
Absalom insisted until David finally let Amnon and all his other sons go with Absalom . Absalom prepared a banquet fit for a king .
Absalom gave an order to his servants : » Watch now and when Amnon begins to feel good from drinking too much wine , I will tell you , Attack Amnon . Then kill him . Do not be afraid . I give this order . Be strong and courageous . «
Absalom’s servants did to Amnon as Absalom ordered . Then all the king’s sons got up , mounted their mules , and fled .
While they were on their way , David heard this rumor : » Absalom has killed all the king’s sons , and not a single one is left . «
The king stood up and tore his clothes . Then he lay down on the ground . All his servants stood beside him with their clothes torn to show their grief .
Jonadab son of David’s brother Shimea , said : » Do not think that all the young men are dead . They have not killed all the king’s sons . Only Amnon is dead . Absalom decided to do this the day his half brother raped his sister Tamar .
» You should not burden your heart with the idea that all the king’s sons are dead . Your Majesty , only Amnon is dead . «
Absalom has fled . The servant keeping the watch looked outside . He saw many people coming down the road beside the mountain west of him .
Jonadab said : » Your Majesty , look ! Here come your sons now , just as I told you . «
As soon as he finished speaking , the king’s sons arrived . They cried loudly and the king and all his men also cried very bitterly .
David was sad for a long time because Amnon was dead .
Absalom ran away to Geshur . He stayed there for three years with King Talmai the son of Ammihud .
King David longed for Absalom once people had consoled him over Amnon’s death .
Joab son of Zeruiah knew the king was still thinking about Absalom .
Joab sent someone to Tekoa to get a wise woman from there . He told her : » Please act like a mourner . Dress in mourning clothes . Do not use any cosmetic lotions . Act like a woman who has been mourning for the dead for a long time .
» Go to the king and speak to him in this way . « Then Joab told her exactly what to say .
The woman from Tekoa came to the king . She immediately bowed down with her face touching the ground . » Help me , Your Majesty , « she said .
The king asked her : » What can I do for you ? « She answered : » I am a widow ; my husband is dead .
» I had two sons who fought with each other in the field . There was no one to separate them . One killed the other .
» All my relatives have turned against me and are demanding that I hand my son over to them . They want to kill him for murdering his brother . If they do this , I will be left without a son . They will destroy my last hope . They will leave my husband without a son to keep his name alive . «
The king responded : » Go back home . I will take care of the matter . «
» Your Majesty , « she said , » do whatever you must . My family and I will take the blame . You and the royal family are innocent . «
The king replied : » If someone threatens you , bring him to me . He will never bother you again . «
She said : » Please pray to Jehovah your God , Your Majesty , so that my relative who is responsible for avenging the death of my son will not commit a greater crime by killing my other son . « » I promise by the living Jehovah , « David replied , » your son will not be harmed . «
She added : » Your Majesty , May I say something ? « » Yes , « he answered .
The woman said : » Have you been hurting God’s people ? Your own son had to leave the country . When you judged in my favor , it was the same as admitting that you should have let him come back .
» We each must die and disappear like water poured out on the ground . But God does not take our lives . Instead , he figures out ways of bringing us back when we run away .
» Your Majesty , I came here to tell you about my problem . I was afraid of what someone might do to me . I decided to come to you , because I thought you could help .
» In fact , I knew that you would listen and save my son and me from those who want to take the land that God gave us .
» I can rest easy now that you have given your decision . You know the difference between right and wrong just like an angel of God . I pray that Jehovah your God will be with you . «
David said : » Now I ask you a question . Do not try to hide the truth ! « The woman replied : » Please go ahead , Your Majesty . «
» Did Joab put you up to this ? « The king asked . The woman answered : » I solemnly swear on your life , Your Majesty , you are absolutely right ! Yes , your servant Joab ordered me to do this . He told me to say exactly what I said .
» Your servant Joab has done this to view this matter from a different angle . You are as wise as an angel of God messenger of God , who knows everything on earth . «
Later on the king said to Joab : » I have decided to do what you want . Go and get the young man Absalom and bring him back here . «
Joab quickly bowed down with his face touching the ground . He blessed the king . He said : » Today I know that you have been kind to me because you did what I wanted . «
Joab went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem .
The king said : » Absalom should return to his own house . Do not let him see me . « So Absalom returned to his house . He did not see the king .
No one in all Israel was praised for his good looks as much as Absalom was . He had no blemish from head to toe .
From time to time , he used to cut his hair because it became heavy for him . When he cut the hair on his head and weighed it , it weighed five pounds according to the king’s standard .
Absalom had three sons and one daughter . His daughter Tamar was a beautiful woman .
Absalom stayed in Jerusalem two years without seeing the king .
So Absalom sent for Joab in order to send him to the king . Joab refused to come . Absalom sent for him a second time . He still refused to come .
Finally , Absalom told his servants : » Joab’s barley field is next to mine . Set it on fire ! « So they set it on fire .
Joab went to Absalom’s house and demanded : » Why have your servants set my field on fire ? «
Absalom answered : » You did not pay any attention when I sent for you . I want you to ask my father why he told me to come back from Geshur . I was better off there . I want to see my father now ! If I am guilty , let him kill me . «
So Joab went to King David . He told him what Absalom said . The king sent for Absalom . He went to the king and bowed down to the ground in front of him . The king welcomed him with a kiss .
Absalom provided a chariot and horses for himself . He had an escort of fifty men to run ahead of him .
He would rise early in the morning and stand by the road at the city gate . When someone came there with a dispute that he wanted the king to settle , Absalom would call him over and ask him where he was from . After the man told him what tribe he was from ,
Absalom would say : » My friend , the law is on your side . However , there is no representative of the king to hear your case . «
He added : » How I wish I were a judge ! Then anyone who had a dispute or a claim could come to me . I would give him justice . «
The man would approach Absalom and bow down before him . Then Absalom would reach out and hug and kiss him .
Absalom did this with every Israelite who came to the king for judgment . That way he won their loyalty .
After four years Absalom said to King David : » My lord let me go to Hebron and keep a promise I made to Jehovah .
» When I lived at Geshur in Syria Aram , I promised Jehovah that if he would take me back to Jerusalem , I would worship him in Hebron . «
» Go in peace , « the king said . » So Absalom went to Hebron . «
He sent messengers to all the tribes of Israel . He told them : » When you hear the sound of trumpets , shout : ‘ Absalom is king in Hebron ! ’ «
Absalom had two hundred men who at his invitation traveled from Jerusalem with him . They knew nothing of the plot and went in good faith .
Absalom was offering sacrifices . He sent for Ahithophel , David’s adviser , to come from his home in Giloh . Meanwhile , the conspiracy grew stronger . The number of people siding with Absalom kept getting larger .
A messenger told David : » Absalom has the hearts of the people of Israel . «
David told all his men who were with him in Jerusalem : » We must run away quickly , or none of us will escape from Absalom . Leave right away or he will catch up to us and bring ruin upon us when he massacres the city . «
The king’s servants told him : » No matter what happens , we are Your Majesty’s servants . «
The king left on foot . His whole household followed him . The king left ten concubines behind to take care of the palace .
The king and his troops left the city on foot . They stopped at the city limits .
All his mercenaries passed by him . The Cherethites , all the Pelethites , Ittai , and all six hundred men who had followed him from Gath marched past the king .
The king asked Ittai from Gath : » Why should you go with us ? Go back , and stay with King Absalom . You are a foreigner , an exile from your homeland .
» In fact you came to us just yesterday . Should I make you wander around with me when I do not even know where I am going ? Go back and take your countrymen with you . May Jehovah always show you kindness . «
Ittai answered : » Your Majesty , I swear to you in the name of Jehovah that I will always go with you wherever you go , even if it means death . «
David answered : » That is fine . March on ! « So Ittai went on with all his men and their dependents .
The people cried loudly as David’s followers left . The king crossed Kidron Brook . His men followed him . They went to the wilderness .
Zadok the priest was there . He had Levites there carrying the sacred Ark of God . They set it down and did not pick it up again until all the people left the city . The priest Abiathar was there too .
The king said to Zadok : » Take the Ark of the Covenant back to the city . If Jehovah is pleased with me he will let me come back to see it and the place where it stays .
» Let him do to me what he wishes if he is not pleased with me . «
He also said to Zadok : » You are a seer , are you ? Take your son Ahimaaz and Abiathar’s son Jonathan and go back to the city in peace .
» I will wait at the river crossings in the wilderness until you send news . «
Zadok and Abiathar took the Ark of the Covenant back into Jerusalem and stayed there .
David went up the slope of the Mount of Olives . He was barefoot and crying . He covered his head to show his sorrow . Everyone with him was crying . They covered their heads too .
Someone told David : » Ahithophel is helping Absalom conspire against you ! « David said : » Please Jehovah keep Ahithophel’s plans from working ! «
David reached the top of the Mount of Olives . He met Hushai the Archite at a place of worship . Hushai’s robe was torn , and dust was on his head .
David told him : » You might slow me down if you come with me . «
Go back into the city and tell Absalom : » Your Majesty , I am your servant . I will serve you just as I served your father in the past . Hushai , if you do that you can help me ruin Ahithophel’s plans .
» Zadok and Abiathar the priests will be there with you . You can tell them everything you hear in the palace .
» Have them send their sons Ahimaaz and Jonathan to tell me what you hear . «
David’s advisor Hushai slipped back into Jerusalem . Absalom came into the city at the same time .
David started down the other side of the Mount of Olives . He met Ziba , the chief servant of Mephibosheth . Ziba had two donkeys that were carrying two hundred loaves of bread , a hundred clusters of raisins , a hundred figs , and some wine .
» What is all this ? « David asked . Ziba said : » The donkeys are for your family to ride . The bread and fruit are for the people to eat . The wine is for them to drink in the desert when they are tired out . «
» Where is your master Saul’s grandson ? « The king asked . » He stayed in Jerusalem , « said Ziba . He said : » Today the house of Israel will give me back my grandfather’s kingdom . «
The king told Ziba : » In that case everything that belonged to Mephibosheth now belongs to you . I sincerely thank you , « said Ziba , » I hope to remain in your good graces , Your Majesty . «
King David arrived at Bahurim . A man who was a distant cousin of Saul came out cursing . His name was Shimei , son of Gera .
Shimei threw stones at David and his officials . This was in spite of the fact that his men and his bodyguards surrounded David .
Shimei cursed him and said : » Get out ! Get out you murderer !
» You took Saul’s kingdom . Now Jehovah is punishing you for murdering so many of Saul’s family . Jehovah has given the kingdom to your son Absalom . You are ruined , you bloodthirsty murderer ! «
Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king : » Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king ? Let me go over there and cut off his head ! «
» What business is this of yours ? « The king said to Abishai and his brother Joab . » If Jehovah told him to curse me who am I to stop him ? «
David said to Abishai and to all his officials : » My own son is trying to kill me . Why should you be surprised at this Benjaminite ? Jehovah told him to curse . Leave him alone and let him curse .
» Perhaps Jehovah will acknowledge my misery and give me some blessings to take away this curse . «
David and his men continued along the road . Shimei kept up with them . He walked on the hillside . He cursed and threw stones and dirt at them as he went .
The king and all the people with him finally arrived at their destination and rested there .
Absalom and all Israel’s troops came to Jerusalem . Ahithophel was with him .
David’s friend Hushai from Archi’s family came to Absalom . He said : » Long live the king ! Long live the king ! «
» Is this how loyal you are to your friend ? « Absalom asked Hushai . » Why did you not go with him ? «
Hushai answered : » Jehovah and the people of Israel have chosen you to be king . I cannot leave . I must stay and serve the one they have chosen .
» After all it seems right for me to serve you , just as I served your father . «
Absalom turned to Ahithophel and said : » Give us your advice ! What should we do ? «
Ahithophel answered : » Some of your father’s wives were left here to take care of the palace . You should have sex with them . Then everyone will find out that you have publicly disgraced your father . This will make you and your followers even more powerful . «
They pitched a tent for Absalom on the palace roof . There in the sight of everyone Absalom went in and had intercourse with his father’s concubines .
Any advice that Ahithophel gave in those days was accepted as though it were the very word of God . David and Absalom followed it .
Later Ahithophel said to Absalom : » Let me choose twelve thousand men . Tonight I will set out after David .
» I will attack him while he is tired and discouraged . He will be frightened ! All his men will run away . I will kill only the king .
» Then I will bring back all his men to you . It will be like a bride returning to her husband . Kill one man and the rest of the people return safely . «
This seemed like good advice to Absalom and all the Israelite leaders .
Absalom said : » Bring in Hushai . Let us hear what he has to say about this . «
Hushai came to Absalom . He told him what Ahithophel planned . Then Absalom said : » Should we do what he says ? If we should not , can you come up with something better ? «
Hushai said : » This time Ahithophel’s advice is not very good .
» You know your father and his followers are mighty warriors . They are as fierce as a mother bear whose cubs have just been killed . Your father has a lot of experience in fighting wars . He will not spend the night with the others .
» He has no doubt already found a hiding place in a cave or somewhere else . When people hear that some of your soldiers have been killed , everyone will think your entire army has been destroyed .
» Even the bravest man with a heart like a lion would lose his courage . All Israel knows that your father is a mighty man and the men with him are brave .
» My advice is to gather all Israel’s troops from Dan to Beersheba . They are as numerous as the sand on the seashore . Lead them into battle yourself .
» Find him and attack him ! We will fall on him as dew falls on the ground . Neither he nor any of his men will be left alive .
» If he retreats into a city , all Israel will bring ropes to that city and drag it into a valley . Not even a pebble will be found there . «
Absalom and all the people of Israel said : » The advice of Hushai from Archi’s family is better than Ahithophel’s advice . Jehovah commanded Ahithophel’s good advice to be defeated in order to ruin Absalom . «
Hushai told the priests Zadok and Abiathar : » Ahithophel advised Absalom and the leaders of Israel to do one thing . But I advised them to do something else .
» Quickly send messengers to tell David : ‘ Do not rest tonight in the river crossings in the desert . Make sure you cross the river . Otherwise Your Majesty and all the troops with him will be wiped out . ’ «
Jonathan and Ahimaaz were waiting at En Rogel . They could not risk being seen coming into the city . A servant girl was to go and tell them . They were to go and tell King David .
A young man saw Jonathan and Ahimaaz and told Absalom . So both of them left quickly . They went to the home of a man in Bahurim who had a cistern in his courtyard . They climbed down into it .
The man’s wife took a covering and spread it over the opening of the cistern . She scattered grain over it so that no one would notice anything .
Absalom’s officials came to the house and asked the woman : » Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan ? « She answered : » They crossed the river . The men looked for them but could not find them . So they returned to Jerusalem . «
After they left , Ahimaaz and Jonathan came up out of the cistern . Then they reported to King David . They told him what Ahithophel planned against him . They said : » Hurry up and cross the river . «
So David and his men crossed the Jordan . By daybreak they had all gone across .
Ahithophel saw that his advice had not been followed . He saddled his donkey and went back to his hometown . He arranged his affairs in order and he hanged himself . He was buried in the family grave .
David went to the town of Mahanaim , and Absalom crossed the Jordan River with the army of Israel .
Absalom put Amasa in Joab’s place as commander of the army . Amasa’s father was Ithra from the family of Ishmael , and his mother was Abigal , the daughter of Nahash and the sister of Joab’s mother Zeruiah .
The Israelites under Absalom’s command set up camp in the region of Gilead .
David went to the town of Mahanaim . Shobi son of Nahash came from Rabbah in Ammon , Machir son of Ammiel came from Lo-Debar , and Barzillai the Gileadite came from Rogelim .
Here is a list of what they brought : sleeping mats , blankets , bowls , pottery jars , wheat , barley , flour , roasted grain , beans , lentils ,
Also honey , yogurt , sheep , and cheese . They brought food for David and the others because they knew that everyone would be hungry , tired , and thirsty from being out in the desert .
David called the troops that were with him . He appointed commanders in charge of regiments and battalions .
David assigned a third of the troops under Joab’s command . He put another third under Joab’s brother Abishai son of Zeruiah . Then he placed the last third under Ittai from Gath . » I am going into battle with you , « the king said to the troops .
» You must not go with us , « they answered . » It will not make any difference to the enemy if the rest of us turn and run . It will not matter even if half of us are killed . But you are worth ten thousand of us . It will be better if you stay here in the city and send us help . «
» I will do what you think best , « the king answered . Then he stood by the side of the gate as his men marched out in units of a thousand and of a hundred .
The king ordered Joab , Abishai , and Ittai : » Treat the young man Absalom gently for my sake . « All the troops heard him give the commanders this order regarding Absalom .
So the troops went to the country to fight Israel in the forest of Ephraim .
Battles were fought all over the forest . David’s soldiers were winning . Twenty thousand soldiers were killed that day .
More soldiers died from the dangers of the forest than from the fighting .
Absalom happened to come face to face with some of David’s men . He was riding on a mule . The mule went under the tangled branches of a large tree . Absalom’s head became caught in the tree . He was left hanging in midair when the mule under him ran away .
A man who saw this told Joab : » I saw Absalom hanging in a tree . «
» What ! You saw what ? « Joab said . » Why did you not strike him to the ground ? Then I would have felt obligated to give you four ounces of silver and a belt . «
The man told Joab : » Even if I felt the weight of twenty pounds of silver in my hand , I would not raise my hand against the king’s son . We heard the order the king gave you , Abishai , and Ittai . Protect the young man Absalom for my sake .
» Would you have stood by me if I did something treacherous to him ? There is nothing hidden from the king . You would turn against me . «
» I will not waste any more time with you , « Joab said . He took three spears and plunged them into Absalom’s chest while he was still alive and hanging in the oak tree .
Ten of Joab’s soldiers closed in on Absalom and finished killing him .
Joab ordered the trumpet blown to stop the fighting . His troops came back from pursuing the Israelites .
They took Absalom’s body and threw it into a deep pit in the forest . Then they covered it with a huge pile of stones . All the Israelites fled to their own hometowns .
During his lifetime Absalom built a monument for himself in King’s Valley . He had no son to keep his name alive . So he named it after himself . To this day it is known as Absalom’s Monument .
Ahimaaz son of Zadok said : » Joab let me run and tell King David that Jehovah rescued him from his enemies . «
Joab answered : » You are not the one to tell the king his son is dead . You can take him a message some other time , but not today . «
Someone from Ethiopia was standing there . Joab told him : » Go tell the king what you have seen . « The man knelt down in front of Joab and then got up and started running .
Ahimaaz spoke to Joab again : » No matter what happens , I still want to run . The Ethiopian has already left . « Joab said : » Why should you run ? You will not get a reward for the news you have ! «
» I would like to run whatever happens , Let me run , « replied Ahimaaz . Joab told him : » Run ! « So Ahimaaz ran along the valley road and got ahead of the Sudanese messenger .
David was sitting between the two gates . The watchman walked along the roof of the gate by the wall . He looked at the man running alone .
The watchman called and alerted the king . If he is alone , the king said , » He has good news to tell . « The runner came closer .
The watchman saw another man running . He called : » There is another man running alone . « The king said : » This one is also bringing good news . «
The watchman said : » It appears the first one runs like Ahimaaz , Zadok’s son . He’s a good man , « the king said . » He must be coming with good news . «
Ahimaaz approached the king , greeted him , and bowed down in front of him . Ahimaaz said : » May Jehovah your God be praised . He has handed over the men who rebelled against Your Majesty . «
» Is the young man Absalom all right ? « The king asked . Ahimaaz answered : » I saw a lot of confusion when Joab sent me away . I did not know what it meant . «
» Step aside , and stand here , « the king said . He stepped aside and stood there .
Then the Sudanese messenger came . Good news for Your Majesty ! He said . Today Jehovah freed you from all who turned against you .
» Is the young man Absalom all right ? « The king asked . The Sudanese messenger answered : » May your enemies and all who turned against you be like that young man ! «
The king was shaken by the news . He went to the room above the gate and cried . » My son Absalom ! « He said . » My son , my son Absalom ! I wish I had died in your place ! Absalom , my son , my son ! «
They brought Joab word . They said : » The king weeps and mourns for Absalom . «
David’s army found out he was crying because his son died . Suddenly their day of victory turned into a day of sadness .
The troops returned to Mahanaim without celebration . It was as if they ran away from battle and were ashamed .
David held his hands over his face and kept on crying loudly . » My son , Absalom ! Absalom , my son , my son ! «
Joab went to the house where David was staying and told him : » You have made your soldiers ashamed ! They saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters and wives as well .
» You are more loyal to your enemies than to your friends . You show your officers and soldiers that they do not mean a thing to you . You would be happy if Absalom was still alive even if the rest of us were dead .
» Now stand up ! Go out there and thank them for what they did . If you do not , I swear by Jehovah you will not even have one man left on your side tomorrow morning . You may have had a lot of troubles in the past . But this will be the worst thing that has ever happened to you ! «
The king sat in the gateway . The troops were told : » The king is sitting in the gateway . « So they went to the king . Meanwhile , Israel fled back to their homes .
All the people in all the tribes of Israel argued with one another . They said : » The king rescued us from our enemies and saved us from the Philistines . Now he has fled from Absalom and left the country .
» Absalom , whom we anointed to rule us , has died in battle . Why is no one talking about reinstating the king ? «
What all Israel was saying reached the king at his house . So King David sent this message to the priests Zadok and Abiathar : » Ask the leaders of Judah , Why should you be the last tribe to reinstate the king back to his palace ?
» You are my relatives , my own flesh and blood . Why should you be the last to reinstate the king ? «
» Say to Amasa : ‘ Are you my flesh and blood ? May God strike me dead unless you are given Joab’s place to serve me always as the commander of the army . ’ «
All the people of Judah were in total agreement . So they sent the king this message : » Come back with all your servants . «
The king returned to the Jordan River . The people of Judah went to Gilgal to meet the king and bring him across the Jordan River .
Shimei son of Gera from the tribe of Benjamin and the town of Bahurim , hurried down with the people of Judah to meet King David .
One thousand people from Benjamin were with him . Ziba the servant of Saul’s family rushed to the Jordan River across from the king . Ziba brought his fifteen sons and twenty servants .
They brought David’s family and servants back across the river . They did everything he wanted them to do . Shimei crossed the Jordan River and bowed down in front of David .
He said : » I beg you not to punish me ! Please forget what I did when you left Jerusalem . Do not even think about it .
» I know I was wrong and have sinned . That is why I wanted to be the first one from the northern tribes to meet you . «
But Abishai shouted : » You should be killed for cursing Jehovah’s chosen king ! «
David exclaimed : » Abishai , what will I do with you and your brother Joab ? Is it your job to tell me who has done wrong ? I have been made king of all Israel today . No one will be put to death ! «
David promised Shimei that he would not be killed .
Mephibosheth grandson of Saul also came to meet David . He missed David so much that he did not take a bath or trim his beard or wash his clothes the whole time David was gone .
They returned to Jerusalem . Mephibosheth came to see David . David asked him : » Why did you not go with me ? «
He answered : » Your Majesty , you know I cannot walk . I told my servant to saddle a donkey for me so I could go with you . But my servant left without me .
» He told you lies about me . My lord the king is like an angel of God . Do what you think is right .
» You could have killed anyone in my entire family . Instead you seated me with those who eat at your table . I no longer have the right to complain to my lord the king . «
The king asked him : » Why do you keep talking about it ? I said you and Ziba should divide the land . «
» Let him take it all , « Mephibosheth told the king . » It is enough for me that you have come home safely . «
Barzillai , the man from Gilead , came from Rogelim with the king to the Jordan River to send him on his way .
Barzillai was a very old man . He was eighty years old . He was very rich . He supplied the king with food while he was staying at Mahanaim .
The king said to him : » Come with me to Jerusalem . I will take care of you . «
Barzillai answered : » I do not have long to live . Why should I go with Your Majesty to Jerusalem ?
» I am already eighty years old . Nothing gives me pleasure any more . I cannot taste what I eat and drink . I cannot hear the voices of singers . I would only be a burden to my lord the king .
» I will cross the river with you . But I will only go a little way on the other side . You do not have to be so kind to me .
» Please let me return to my hometown . There I can someday be buried near my father and mother . My servant Chimham can go with you . You can treat him as your own . «
David said : » I will take Chimham with me . Whatever you ask me to do for him , I will do . If you want anything else I will do it . «
David’s soldiers went across the river . He stayed behind to tell Barzillai good-by and to wish him well . Barzillai returned home .
Chimham crossed the river with David . All of Judah’s army and half of Israel’s army were there to help David cross the river .
All the people of Israel came to the king . They asked : » Why did our brothers , the people of Judah , kidnap you and bring you and your family across the Jordan River ? «
All the people of Judah answered the people of Israel : » Because the king is our relative . Why are you angry about this ? Did we eat the king’s food , or did he give us any gifts ? «
The Israelites replied : » We have ten times as many claims on King David as you have ! We know he is one of you . Why do you look down on us ? Do not forget that we were the first to talk about bringing the king back ! « The men of Judah were more violent in making their claims than the men of Israel .
A worthless character named Sheba son of Bikri lived at Gilgal . He was of the tribe of Benjamin . He blew the trumpet and called out : » Down with David ! We will not follow him ! Men of Israel , let us go home ! «
The Israelites deserted David and went with Sheba . The men of Judah remained loyal and followed David from the Jordan to Jerusalem .
David left ten of his concubines in Jerusalem to take care of his palace . When he returned , he had them taken to another house . He placed soldiers there to guard them . He gave them what they needed . He never slept with any of them again . They had to live there for the rest of their lives as if they were widows .
David said to Amasa : » Three days from now I want you and all of Judah’s army to be here ! «
Amasa assembled the army of Judah . It took longer than three days .
David said to Abishai : » Sheba will hurt us more than Absalom ever did . Take my best soldiers and go after him . We do not want him to take over any walled cities and get away from us . «
Joab’s men , the Cherethites , Pelethites , and all the soldiers went with Abishai . They left Jerusalem to pursue Sheba son of Bichri .
Amasa met them at the large rock in Gibeon . Joab wore a military uniform . He strapped a sword in a scabbard at his hip . He stepped forward and the sword dropped into his hand .
» How are you , my brother ? « Joab asked Amasa . He took hold of Amasa’s beard with his right hand to kiss him .
Amasa was not on guard against the sword in Joab’s left hand . Joab stabbed him in the stomach . Then he stabbed him in his intestines and they poured out on the ground . He died without being stabbed again . Then Joab and his brother Abishai pursued Sheba son of Bichri .
One of Joab’s young men stood beside Amasa and said : » Those who favor Joab and are on David’s side should follow Joab . «
Amasa’s body was covered with blood in the middle of the road . Joab’s man saw that everybody was stopped . He dragged the body from the road out into the field and threw a blanket over it .
After the body had been removed from the road , everyone followed Joab in pursuit of Sheba .
Sheba went through all of the tribes of Israel when he came to the town of Abel Beth-Maacah . His best soldiers met him there and followed him into the town .
Joab and his troops surrounded Abel , so no one could go in or come out . They made a dirt ramp rampart up to the town wall . Then they used a battering ram to knock the wall down .
A wise woman shouted from the top of the wall : » Hear this ! Listen to me ! I must talk to Joab ! Tell him to come here ! «
He came near . She asked : » Are you Joab ? « » I am , « He answered . » Listen to what I have to say , « She told him . » I am listening , « He answered .
She said : » There is an old saying : ‘ Be sure to seek guidance from Abel before doing anything . ’ ’ That is the way they settle disputes .
» We are peaceful and faithful Israelites . You seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel ? Why should you swallow up what belongs to Jehovah ? ’ «
Joab answered : » That is unthinkable ! I do not wish to swallow it up or destroy it .
» That is not so . A man from the mountains of Ephraim by the name of Sheba son of Bichri has rebelled against King David . Give him to me and I will withdraw from the city . « The woman told Joab : » Watch , for his head will be thrown to you from the wall . «
She went to the people of the city with her plan . They cut off Sheba’s head and threw it over the wall to Joab . He blew the trumpet as a signal for his men to leave the city . They went back home . Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king .
Joab was in command of the army of Israel . Benaiah son of Jehoiada was in charge of David’s bodyguards .
Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor . Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was in charge of the records .
Sheva was the court secretary . Zadok and Abiathar were the priests .
And Ira , a descendant of Jair , was a priest to David .
There was a famine for three successive years during David’s reign . David asked Jehovah for advice about it . Jehovah answered : » It is because of Saul and his family . They are guilty of murder because they killed the people of Gibeon . «
The Gibeonites were not a part of Israel but were left over from the Amorites . The Israelites swore to spare them . Saul , in his eagerness , tried to destroy them for Israel and Judah . The king called the Gibeonites .
He asked them : » What can I do for you ? What shall I give you to make peace with you so that you will bless what belongs to Jehovah ? «
The Gibeonites responded : » Our quarrel with Saul and his family cannot be settled with silver or gold . We do not want to kill any Israelite . « What do you want me to do ? « David asked .
They answered : » Saul wanted to destroy us and leave none of us alive anywhere in Israel .
» Hand over seven of his male descendants . We will hang them before Jehovah at Gibeah , the hometown of Saul , Jehovah’s chosen king . « The king responded : » I will hand them over to you . «
David made a promise to Jonathan with Jehovah as his witness . He spared Jonathan’s son Mephibosheth , the grandson of Saul .
Saul and Rizpah the daughter of Aiah had two sons named Armoni and Mephibosheth . Saul’s daughter Merab had five sons whose father was Adriel the son of Barzillai from Meholah . David took Rizpah’s two sons and Merab’s five sons .
He turned them over to the Gibeonites . They hanged all seven of them on the mountain near the place where Jehovah was worshiped . This happened right at the beginning of the barley harvest .
Rizpah daughter of Aiah spread some sackcloth on a nearby rock . She would not let the birds land on the bodies during the day . She kept the wild animals away at night . She stayed there from the beginning of the harvest until it started to rain .
[ The Philistines killed Saul and Jonathan on Mount Gilboa and hung their bodies in the town square at Beth-Shan . The people of Jabesh in Gilead secretly took the bodies away . ] David found out what Saul's wife Rizpah did . So he went to the leaders of Jabesh to get the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan .
David took the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from the citizens of Jabesh Gilead . They had stolen them from the public square of Beth Shean , where the Philistines hung them the day they killed Saul at Gilboa .
David brought the bones of Saul and Jonathan . His men also gathered the bones of those who had been executed .
Then they buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the land of Benjamin , at Zela , in the tomb of Saul’s father Kish . They did everything the king ordered . After that God answered the prayers for the land .
Once again there was a battle between the Philistines and Israel . David and his men went to fight the Philistines . David became exhausted .
A descendant of Haraphah named Benob had a copper spear weighing seven and one half pounds . He wore it on a new belt . He captured David and intended to kill him .
Abishai son of Zeruiah came to David’s rescue . Abishai attacked the giant and killed him . Then David’s men made David promise that he would never again go out with them to battle . » You are the hope of Israel . We do not want to lose you ! « They said .
After this there was a battle with the Philistines at Gob . Sibbecai from Hushah killed a giant named Saph a descendant of Rapha .
There was another battle with the Philistines at Gob . Elhanan son of Jair from Bethlehem killed Goliath from Gath . Goliath’s spear had a shaft as thick as the bar on a weaver’s loom .
There was another war , this time in Gath . One of the enemy soldiers was a descendant of the Rephaim . He was as big as a giant and had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot .
When he challenged Israel , Jonathan , son of David’s brother Shimei , killed him .
These four were descendants of Haraphah from Gath . David and his men killed them .
David sang this song to Jehovah when Jehovah rescued him from all his enemies , especially from Saul .
He said : » Jehovah is my rock and my fortress . He is my Savior ,
» My God , My rock in whom I take refuge . He is my shield , the strength of my salvation , my stronghold and my refuge . He is my Savior who saved me from violence .
» Jehovah should be praised . I called on him and was saved from my enemies .
» The waves of death had surrounded me . The torrents of destruction had overwhelmed me .
» The danger of death was around me . The grave set its trap for me .
» I called to Jehovah in my trouble . I called to my God for help . In his temple he heard my voice . He listened to my cry for help .
» Earth shook and shivered ! The columns supporting the sky rocked back and forth . You were angry .
» You breathed out smoke . Scorching heat and fiery flames spewed from your mouth .
» You opened the heavens like curtains . You came down with storm clouds under your feet .
» You rode on the angels as you flew . You soared on the wings of the wind .
» You surrounded yourself with darkness . You made the dark rain clouds your covers .
» Out of the brightness in front of you , you made lightning .
» Jehovah thundered from heaven . The Most High made his voice heard .
» You shot arrows and scattered them . You flashed bolts of lightning and confused them .
» Then the ocean floor could be seen . The foundations of the earth were laid bare at Jehovah’s stern warning , at the blast of breath from your nostrils .
» You reached down from high above and took hold of me . You pulled me out of the raging water .
» You rescued me from enemies who were hateful and too powerful for me .
» When I was in trouble they attacked me . You O Sovereign Jehovah protected me .
» You helped me out of danger . You saved me because you were pleased with me .
» You Jehovah rewarded me because of my righteousness . Because my hands are clean you rewarded me .
» I have kept the ways of Jehovah . I have not wickedly turned away from my God .
» All your judgments are in front of me . I have not turned away from your laws .
» You know I am faultless . I have kept myself from doing wrong .
» You reward me because I do what is right . You know I am innocent .
» O Jehovah , you are faithful to those who are faithful to you , and completely good to those who are faultless .
» You are pure to those who are pure , but hostile to those who are wicked .
» You rescue the humble . You find ways to humiliate the proud .
» Jehovah our God , you are my lamp . You turn darkness into light .
» You help me run through armies and leap over city walls .
» Your way is perfect Jehovah . Your word is correct . You are a shield for those who run to you for help .
» Who is God but Jehovah ? Who is a rock other than our God ?
» God arms me with strength . Your perfect way sets me free .
» You make me sure-footed as a deer . You keep me safe on the mountains .
» You train me for battle , so that I can use the strongest bow .
» O Jehovah you protect me and save me . Your help has made me grow great multiply .
» You clear the way for me . I will not stumble .
» I chased my enemies until I caught them and destroyed them .
» I destroyed them ! I stuck my sword through my enemies . They were crushed under my feet .
» You armed me and gave me strength to fight . You subdued and brought low those who came against me .
» By you they turn their backs and run . Those who hate me are silenced .
» They cried for help , but there was no help . They called to you Jehovah and you did not answer .
» They were crushed as small as the dust of the earth . I stamped them down under my feet like the waste of the streets .
» You rescued me from my stubborn people . You made me the leader of foreign nations . They are now my slaves .
» Foreigners obey and come crawling .
» Foreigners lose heart and are fearful in their fortresses .
» Jehovah lives ! Blessed is my rock ! May God , the rock of my salvation , be glorified .
» You , Jehovah , give me victory over my enemies ! You subdue nations under me .
» You protect me from violent enemies . You made me greater than all of them .
» I will praise you , Jehovah , and I will honor you among the nations .
» You give glorious victories to your anointed king . Your faithful love for David and for his descendants will never end . «
These are the last words of David : Here is the declaration by David , son of Jesse . The declaration by the man whom God raised up , whom the God of Jacob anointed , the singer of Israel’s psalms :
» The Spirit of Jehovah spoke through me . His word was on my tongue .
» The God of Israel has spoken . The protector of Israel said to me : ‘ The king who rules with justice , who rules in obedience to God .
» ‘ He is like the sun shining on a cloudless day . The sun that makes the grass sparkle after rain .
» ‘ That is how God will bless my descendants . He made an eternal covenant with me . It is an agreement that will not be broken , a promise that will not be changed . That is all I desire . That will be my victory , and God will surely bring it about .
» ‘ All the evildoers will be like thorns to be pushed away . They may not be gripped in the hand :
» ‘ But with a sharp spear . They are burned on the spot . ’ «
These are the names of David’s warriors : Ishbosheth son of Hachmon was the leader of the Three Warriors . In one battle , he killed eight hundred men with his spear .
The next one of the Three Warriors was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite . One time when the Philistines were at war with Israel , he and David dared the Philistines to fight them . Every one of the Israelite soldiers turned and ran .
Eleazar was the exception . He killed Philistines until his hand was cramped . He could not let go of his sword . When Eleazar finished , all the Israelite troops had to do was come back and take the enemies’ weapons and armor . Jehovah gave Israel a great victory that day .
Next in rank to him was Shammah , the son of Agee from Harar . The Philistines had gathered at Lehi , where there was a field of ripe lentils . When the troops fled from the Philistines ,
he stood in the middle of the field and defended it by killing Philistines . So Jehovah won an impressive victory .
At harvest time three of the thirty leading men came to David at the cave of Adullam when a troop from the Philistine army was camping in the valley of Rephaim .
David was on a fortified hill . A group of Philistines occupied Bethlehem .
David grew homesick . He said : » I wish someone would bring me a drink of water from the well by the gate at Bethlehem ! «
The three famous soldiers forced their way through the Philistine camp . They then drew some water from the well , and brought it back to David . But he would not drink it . He poured it out as an offering to Jehovah .
David said : » Jehovah , I could never drink this ! It would be like drinking the blood of these men who risked their lives ! « So he refused to drink it . Those were the brave deeds of the three famous soldiers .
Joab’s brother Abishai led the Thirty Warriors . In one battle he killed three hundred men with his spear . He was as famous as the Three Warriors .
In fact he was just as famous as the rest of the Thirty Warriors . He was the commander of the Thirty Warriors . Yet he still did not become one of the Three Warriors .
Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a brave man from Kabzeel who did some amazing things . He killed two of Moab’s best fighters . On a snowy day he went down into a pit and killed a lion .
He killed an Egyptian as big as a giant . The Egyptian was armed with a spear . Benaiah only had a club . Benaiah grabbed the spear from the Egyptian and killed him with it .
Benaiah never became one of the Three Warriors . He was just as famous as they were and certainly just as famous as the rest of the Thirty Warriors . David made him the leader of his bodyguard .
He was honored over the rest of the Thirty Warriors . But he was not equal to the first three . David made him in charge over the fighting men who kept him safe .
One of the thirty was Joab’s brother Asahel . The thirty leading men were Elhanan son of Dodo from Bethlehem ,
Shammah from Harod , Elika from Harod ,
Helez the Paltite , Ira son of Ikkesh from Tekoa ,
Abiezer from Anathoth , Mebunnai son of Hushai ,
Zalmon descendant of Ahohi , Maharai from Netophah ,
Heleb son of Baanah from Netophah , Ittai son of Ribai from Gibeah in Benjamin ,
Benaiah from Pirathon , Hiddai from the Gaash ravines ,
Abi Albon from Beth Arabah , Azmaveth from Bahurim ,
Elihba from Shaalbon , Bene Jashen ,
Jonathan son of Shammah the Hararite , Ahiam son of Sharar the Hararite ,
Eliphelet son of Ahasbai and grandson of a man from Maacah , Eliam son of Ahithophel from Gilo ,
Hezrai from Carmel , Paarai from Arabah ,
Igal son of Nathan from Zobah , Bani from the tribe of Gad ,
Zelek from Ammon , Naharai from Beeroth , armorbearer for Zeruiah’s son Joab ,
Ira descendant of Ithra , Gareb descendant of Ithra ,
and Uriah the Hittite , thirty-seven in all .
Jehovah became angry at Israel again . He provoked David to turn against Israel . He said : » Go count the people of Israel and Judah . «
King David said to Joab the commander of the army : » Go throughout the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beersheba and count the people . That way I will know how many there are . «
Joab answered reluctantly : » Your Majesty , may Jehovah your God make the people of Israel a hundred times more numerous than they are now . May you live to see him do it . But why does Your Majesty want to do this ? «
The king made Joab and his officers obey his order . They left his presence and went out to count the people of Israel .
They crossed the Jordan and camped south of Aroer , the city in the middle of the valley , in the territory of Gad . Then they went north to Jazer .
They went to Gilead and to Kadesh in Syria . Then they went to Dan Dan-jaan , Ijon , and on toward Sidon .
They came to the fortress of Tyre . They went through every town of the Hivites and the Canaanites . Finally , they went to Beersheba in the Southern Desert of Judah .
After they went through the whole land , they went back to Jerusalem . It took them nine months and twenty days .
Joab told David : In Israel there is eight hundred thousand who can serve in the army . In Judah there are five hundred thousand .
After David had everyone counted , he felt guilty and told Jehovah : » What I did was stupid and terribly wrong . Jehovah , please forgive me . «
When David got up in the morning , Jehovah spoke his word to the prophet Gad , David’s seer .
» Go tell David : ‘ This is what Jehovah says : » I offer you three choices . Choose the one you want me to do to you . « ’ «
Gad told David the three choices as follows : » Seven years of famine could come to you and your land . You could flee from your enemies as they pursue you for three months . Or there could be a three-day plague in your land ? Think it over , and decide what answer I should give the one who sent me . «
» I am in a desperate situation , « David told Gad . » Please let us fall into Jehovah’s hands because he is very merciful . But do not let me fall into human hands . «
So Jehovah sent a plague among the Israelites from that morning until the time he had chosen . Of the people from Dan to Beersheba , seventy thousand died .
When the angel stretched out his arm to destroy Jerusalem , Jehovah changed his mind about the disaster . » Enough ! « He said to the angel who was destroying the people . » Put down your weapon . « The angel of Jehovah was at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite .
David saw the angel who had been killing the people . He said to Jehovah : » I have sinned . I have done wrong . What have these sheep done ? Please let your punishment be against me and against my father’s family . «
Gad came to David and said : » Go , set up an altar for Jehovah at Araunah the Jebusite’s threshing floor . «
David obeyed Jehovah’s command and went as Gad had told him to .
Araunah saw David and his soldiers coming toward him . He went over to David and bowed down low ,
and said : » My lord the king ! Why have you come to see me ? « David answered : » I came to buy your threshing place . I have to build Jehovah an altar here , so this disease will stop killing the people . «
Araunah said : » Take what you want and offer your sacrifice . Here are some cattle for the sacrifice . You can use the threshing-boards and the wooden yokes for the fire . «
Araunah gave this to the king and said : » May Jehovah your God accept you . «
» No ! « The king said to Araunah . » I must buy it from you at a fair price . I will not offer Jehovah my God burnt sacrifices that cost me nothing . « So David bought the threshing floor and the cattle for one and one quarter pounds of silver .
David built an altar for Jehovah there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings . So Jehovah heard the prayers for the country . The plague on Israel stopped .
Now King David was old and advanced in years . They put covers over him but he could not get warm .
His servants said to him : » Your Majesty let us find a young woman to stay with you and take care of you . She will lie close to you and keep you warm . «
They searched all over Israel for a beautiful young woman , and in Shunem they found such a woman named Abishag , and brought her to the king .
She was very beautiful . She waited on the king and took care of him . However , he did not have intercourse with her .
Adonijah , son of Haggith , was very handsome . His mother gave birth to him after Maacah had Absalom . Adonijah boasted about himself , saying , » I will be king . « He got a chariot and horses and fifty men to run ahead of him .
His father never confronted him by asking : » Why have you done this ? «
But Adonijah had discussed his actions with Joab son of Zeruiah and with the priest Abiathar , so they supported him .
But the priest Zadok , Benaiah son of Jehoiada , the prophet Nathan , Shimei , Rei , and David's thirty special guards did not join Adonijah .
Adonijah sacrificed sheep , cattle , and fattened calves at Zoheleth Rock near En Rogel . He invited all his brothers , the king's other sons , all the men of Judah , and the king's officials .
But he did not invite the prophet Nathan , Benaiah , the special guard or his brother Solomon .
Then Nathan asked Solomon's mother Bathsheba : » Have you heard that Adonijah , Haggith's son , has become king , and our master David does not even know about it ?
» Bathsheba , let me give you some advice about how to save your life and your son's life .
» ‘ Go now to King David and ask him : ‘ Your Majesty , did you solemnly promise me that my son Solomon would succeed you as king ? How is it that Adonijah has become king ? ’
Nathan added : » While you are still talking with King David , I will come in and confirm your story . «
So Bathsheba went to see the king in his bedroom . He was very old , and Abishag , the young woman from Shunem , was taking care of him .
Bathsheba bowed low before the king . He asked : » What do you want ? «
She answered : » Your Majesty , you made me a solemn promise in the name of Jehovah your God that my son Solomon would be king after you .
» Adonijah has already become king . You do not know anything about it .
» He has offered a sacrifice of many bulls , sheep , and fattened calves . He invited your sons , and Abiathar the priest , and Joab the commander of your army to the feast . However he did not invite your son Solomon .
» Your Majesty . The people of Israel want you to tell them who is to succeed you as king .
» If you do not my son Solomon and I will be treated as traitors when you die . «
Nathan arrived at the palace while she spoke .
The king was told that the prophet was there . Nathan went in and bowed low before the king .
Nathan said : » Your Majesty . Did you announce that Adonijah would succeed you as king ?
» This very day he has gone and offered a sacrifice of many bulls , sheep , and fattened calves . He invited all your sons , Joab the commander of your army , and Abiathar the priest , and right now they are feasting with him and shouting : ‘ Long live King Adonijah ! ’
» But he did not invite Zadok the priest or Benaiah or Solomon or me .
» Did Your Majesty approve all this and not even tell your officials who is to succeed you as king ? «
King David said : » Ask Bathsheba to come back in . « She came and stood before him .
Then he said to her : » I promise you by the living God Jehovah , who has rescued me from all my troubles ,
that today I will keep the promise I made to you in the name of Jehovah the God of Israel , that your son Solomon would succeed me as king . «
Bathsheba bowed low and said : » May my lord the king live a very long time ! «
Then King David sent for Zadok , Nathan , and Benaiah . When they came in ,
he said to them : » Take my court officials with you ; have my son Solomon ride my own mule , and escort him to Gihon Spring ,
Zadok and Nathan are to anoint him as king of Israel . Then blow the trumpet and shout : Long live King Solomon !
» Follow him back here when he comes to sit on my throne . He will succeed me as king . He is the one I have chosen to be the ruler over Israel and Judah . «
» It will be done , « answered Benaiah , » and may Jehovah your God confirm it !
» Jehovah has been with Your Majesty . May he also be with Solomon and make his reign even more prosperous than yours . «
So Zadok , Nathan , Benaiah , and the royal bodyguards put Solomon on King David's mule and escorted him to Gihon Spring .
Zadok took the container of olive oil that he had brought from the Tent of Jehovah’s presence , and anointed Solomon . They blew the trumpet , and all the people shouted : » Long live King Solomon ! «
All the people followed him . They blew flutes and celebrated so loudly that their voices shook the ground .
Adonijah and all his guests heard this while they were eating . When Joab heard the sound of the horn , he asked : » Why all this noise in the city ? «
He was still speaking when Jonathan , son of the priest Abiathar , arrived . » Come in , « Adonijah said : » You are an honorable man . You must be bringing good news . «
» Not at all , « Jonathan answered Adonijah . » His Majesty King David has made Solomon king ! «
» The king sent the priest Zadok , the prophet Nathan , Benaiah son of Jehoiada , the Cherethites , and the Pelethites with him . They placed him on the king's mule .
» The priest Zadok and the prophet Nathan anointed him king at Gihon . They came from there celebrating . The city is excited . That is the sound you heard .
» Solomon is seated on the royal throne .
» Even the royal officials have come to congratulate His Majesty King David , saying : May your God make Solomon's name more famous than yours and his reign greater than your reign . The king himself bowed down on his bed
and prayed : ‘ Let us praise Jehovah the God of Israel . Today he made one of my descendants succeed me as king . ’ ’ He let me live to see it ! «
Adonijah's guests were afraid . So they all left .
Adonijah , in great fear of Solomon , went to the Tent of Jehovah’s presence and grabbed hold of the corners of the altar .
King Solomon was told that Adonijah was afraid of him and that he was holding on to the corners of the altar . He heard that he said : » First , I want King Solomon to swear to me that he will not have me put to death . «
Solomon replied : » If he is loyal , not even a hair on his head will be touched . If he is not , he will die . «
King Solomon then sent for Adonijah and had him brought down from the altar . Adonijah went to the king and bowed low before him . The king said to him : » You may go home . «
David was about to die . He called his son Solomon and gave him his last instructions :
» It is my time to die . I go the way of all people of the earth . Be strong and be a man .
» Do what Jehovah your God orders you to do . Obey all his laws and commands , as written in the Law of Moses . That way wherever you go you may prosper in everything you do .
» ‘ If you obey Jehovah he will keep the promise he made when he told me , ‘ Your descendants will rule Israel as long as they are careful to obey my commands faithfully with all their heart and being . ’
» Remember what Joab did to me by killing the two commanders of Israel's armies , Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether . You remember how he murdered them in time of peace . This was revenge for deaths they had caused in time of war . He killed innocent men . I bear the responsibility for what he did . I suffer the consequences .
» You know what to do . You must not let him die a natural death .
» But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai from Gilead and take care of them . They were kind to me when I was fleeing from your brother Absalom .
" There is also Shimei son of Gera , from the town of Bahurim in Benjamin . He cursed me with a bitter curse the day I went to Mahanaim . When he met me at the Jordan River , I gave him my solemn promise in the name of Jehovah , saying , ‘ I will not have you killed by the sword . ’ «
» However you must not let him go unpunished . You know what to do . You must make sure he is put to death . «
David died and was buried in David's City .
He was king of Israel for forty years . He ruled seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem .
Solomon succeeded his father David as king . His royal power was firmly established .
Adonijah , son of Haggith , went to Bathsheba , Solomon's mother . » Is this a friendly visit ? « She asked . » Yes , « he answered .
I have something to discuss with you . He said . What is it ? She asked .
He said : » You know the kingship was mine . All Israel expected me to be their king . But the kingship has been turned over to my brother because Jehovah gave it to him .
» I have one request to make to you . Do not say no to me . « She responded : » Tell me . «
He said : » Will you go to Solomon the king for he will not say ‘ No ’ ’ to you . And make my request that he give me Abishag the Shunammite for a wife ? «
Bathsheba said : » Indeed , I will make your request to the king . «
So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to talk to him for Adonijah . The king stood up to meet her and bowed down to her . He took his place on the king's throne and she sat at his right hand on the seat made ready for the king's mother .
Then she said : » I have one small request to make of you . Do not say ‘ No ’ ’ to me . « The king replied : » Speak mother for I will not say no to you . «
She said : » Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother for a wife . «
Then King Solomon answered : » Why are you requesting me to give Abishag the Shunammite to Adonijah ? Take the kingdom for him in addition , for he is my older brother , and Abiathar the priest and Joab , the son of Zeruiah , are on his side . «
King Solomon took an oath by Jehovah , saying : » May God's punishment be on me if Adonijah does not give payment for these words with his life .
» Now by the living God Jehovah who has given me my throne from David my father . He made me one of a line of kings . He gave me his word . Adonijah will be put to death this day . «
King Solomon sent Benaiah , the son of Jehoiada to attack and kill him .
The king spoke to Abiathar the priest : » Go to your fields at Anathoth . You deserve death . But I will not put you to death now , because you carried the Ark of Jehovah God before David my father . You were with him in all his troubles . «
Solomon did not allow Abiathar to be priest any longer . So the word of Jehovah came true concerning the sons of Eli in Shiloh .
Joab received news of this for Joab had been one of Adonijah's supporters . He was not on Absalom's side . Then Joab went in flight to the Tent of Jehovah and put his hands on the corners of the altar .
When King Solomon heard about this he sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada to kill him .
Benaiah went to the Tent of Jehovah and told Joab : Come out . Joab said : » No ! Let me die here . « So Benaiah returned to the king and gave him the answer Joab gave him .
The king said : » Do as he said . Kill him there and bury him in the earth . This will remove the guilt of his senseless murders from my father’s family and me .
» Jehovah will punish Joab for those murders he committed without my father David's knowledge . Joab killed two innocent men who were better men than he : Abner , commander of the army of Israel , and Amasa , commander of the army of Judah .
» Jehovah will repay him for the blood Joab shed . The blood will fall on Joab and on his descendants as long as they live . Jehovah will always give success to David's descendants who sit on his throne . «
So Benaiah went to the Tent of Jehovah’s presence and killed Joab . He was buried at his home in the wilderness .
The king made Benaiah commander of the army in Joab's place and put Zadok the priest in Abiathar's place .
The king sent for Shimei and said to him : » Build a house for yourself here in Jerusalem . Live in it and do not leave the city .
» If you ever leave and go beyond Kidron Brook , you will die and it will be your fault . «
» As you say , Your Majesty , « Shimei answered . » I will do what you say . « So he lived in Jerusalem a long time .
Three years later , however , two of Shimei's slaves ran away to the king of Gath , Achish son of Maacah . When Shimei heard that they were in Gath ,
he saddled his donkey and went to King Achish in Gath , to find his slaves . He found them and brought them back home .
When Solomon heard what Shimei did ,
he sent for him and said : » I made you promise in Jehovah’s name not to leave Jerusalem . I warned you that if you ever did , you would die . Did you not agree to it and say that you would obey me ?
» Why did you break your promise and disobey my command ?
» You know very well all the wrong that you did to my father David . Jehovah will punish you for it .
» But he will bless me , and he will make David's kingdom secure forever . «
The king gave orders to Benaiah son of Jehoiada . He killed Shimei . Solomon was now in complete control .
Solomon made an alliance with the king of Egypt by marrying his daughter . He brought her to live in David's City until he finished building his palace , the Temple , and the wall around Jerusalem .
A Temple had not yet been built for Jehovah . The people were still offering sacrifices at many different altars .
Solomon loved Jehovah . He followed the instructions of his father David . He also slaughtered animals and offered them as sacrifices on different altars .
One time he went to Gibeon to offer sacrifices because that was where the most used altar was . He offered hundreds of burnt offerings there in the past .
That night Jehovah appeared to him in a dream and asked him : » What do you want me to give you ? «
Solomon answered : » You always showed great love for my father David , your servant . He was good , loyal , and honest in his relation with you . You have continued to show him your great and constant love by giving him a son who today rules in his place .
» O Jehovah God , you allowed me to succeed my father as king , even though I am very young and do not know how to rule .
» I am among the people you have chosen to be your own . They are a people who are so many that they cannot be counted .
‘ Give me the wisdom I need to rule your people with justice . Help me know the difference between good and evil . Otherwise , how would I ever be able to rule this great people of yours ? «
Jehovah was pleased that Solomon asked for this .
He said to him : » Because you have asked for the wisdom to rule justly , instead of long life for yourself or riches or the death of your enemies ,
» I will do what you have asked . I will give you more wisdom and understanding than anyone has ever had . There has never been nor will ever be anyone like you .
» I will also give you what you did not ask for . All your life you will have wealth and honor , more than that of any other king .
» If you obey me and keep my laws and commands , as your father David did , I will give you a long life . «
Solomon woke up and was aware that God had spoken to him in the dream . Then he went to Jerusalem and stood in front of Jehovah’s Ark of the Covenant . He offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to Jehovah . Then he gave a feast for all his officials .
One day two women who were prostitutes came to the king .
One of them said : » Your Majesty , this woman and I live in the same house . I gave birth to a baby boy at home while she was there .
» Two days after my child was born she also gave birth to a baby boy . Only the two of us were there in the house . No one else was there .
» One night she accidentally rolled over on her baby and smothered it .
» She got up during the night and took my son from my side while I was asleep . She took him to her bed and put the dead child in my bed .
» The next morning I woke up and was going to nurse my baby . It was dead . I looked at it more closely and saw that it was not my child . «
The other woman said : » The living child is mine , and the dead one is yours ! « The first woman answered back : » The dead child is yours , and the living one is mine ! « They argued before the king .
King Solomon said : » Each of you claims that the living child is hers and that the dead child belongs to the other one . «
He sent for a sword . When it arrived ,
he said : » Cut the living child in two and give each woman half of it . «
With a heart full of love for her son the real mother said : » Please , Your Majesty , do not kill the child ! Give it to her ! « But the other woman said : » Do not give it to either of us cut it in two . «
Then Solomon said : » Do not kill the child ! Give it to the first woman . She is the real mother . «
The people of Israel heard of Solomon's decision and were all filled with deep respect for him . They knew then that God had given him the wisdom to settle disputes fairly .
Solomon was king over all Israel .
His high officials were as follows : The priest : Azariah son of Zadok ,
the court secretaries : Elihoreph and Ahijah , sons of Shisha In charge of the records : Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud .
Commander of the army : Benaiah son of Jehoiada . Priests : Zadok and Abiathar .
Chief of the district governors : Azariah son of Nathan Royal Adviser : the priest Zabud son of Nathan .
In charge of the palace servants : Ahishar In charge of the forced labor : Adoniram son of Abda .
Solomon appointed twelve men as district governors in Israel . They provided food from their districts for the king and his household , each man being responsible for one month out of the year .
The following are the names of these twelve officers and the districts they were in charge of : Benhur : the mountains of Ephraim ,
Bendeker : the cities of Makaz , Shaalbim , Beth Shemesh , Elon , and Beth Hanan ,
Benhesed : the cities of Arubboth and Socoh and all the territory of Hepher ,

Bengeber : the city of Ramoth in Gilead , and the villages in Gilead belonging to the clan of Jair , a descendant of Manasseh , and the region of Argob in Bashan , sixty large towns in all , fortified with walls and with bronze bars on the gates .
Ahinadab son of Iddo : the district of Mahanaim .
Ahimaaz , who was married to Basemath , another of Solomon's daughters : the territory of Naphtali .
Baana son of Hushai : the region of Asher and the town of Bealoth .
Jehoshaphat son of Paruah : the territory of Issachar .
Shimei son of Ela : the territory of Benjamin .
Geber son of Uri : the region of Gilead , which had been ruled by King Sihon of the Amorites and King Og of Bashan . Besides these twelve , there was one governor over all the land .
The people of Judah and Israel were as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore . They ate and drank and were very happy .
Solomon's kingdom included all the nations from the Euphrates River to Philistia and the Egyptian border . They paid him taxes and were subject to him all his life .
The supplies Solomon needed each day were one hundred and fifty bushels of fine flour and three hundred bushels of meal .
Also needed were ten stall-fed cattle , twenty pasture-fed cattle , and one hundred sheep , besides deer , gazelles , roebucks , and fowl cuckoo .
Solomon ruled over all the land west of the Euphrates River , from Tiphsah on the Euphrates as far west as the city of Gaza . All the kings west of the Euphrates were subject to him . He was at peace with all the neighboring countries .
As long as he lived , the people throughout Judah and Israel lived in safety . Each family had its own grapevines and fig trees .
Solomon had forty thousand stalls for his chariot horses and twelve thousand cavalry horses .
His twelve governors supplied the food King Solomon needed for all who ate in the palace . They always supplied everything needed , each one in the month assigned .
Each governor also supplied his share of barley and straw as needed for the chariot horses and the work animals .
God gave Solomon great wisdom and insight , and knowledge too great to be measured .
Solomon was wiser than the wise men of the East or the wise men of Egypt .
He was the wisest of all men . He was wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite , and Heman , Calcol , and Darda , and the sons of Mahol . His fame spread throughout all the neighboring countries .
He wrote three thousand proverbs and more than a thousand songs .
He spoke of trees and plants , from the Lebanon cedars to the hyssop that grows on walls . He talked about animals , birds , reptiles , and fish .
Kings all over the world heard of his wisdom and sent people to listen to the Wisdom of Solomon .
When King Hiram of Tyre heard that Solomon succeeded his father as king he sent ambassadors to Solomon . He had always been a friend of David's .
Solomon sent this message to Hiram :
» You know my father David could not build a Temple for the worship of Jehovah due to the constant wars he had to fight . There were enemies in countries all around him . First Jehovah had to give him victory over all his enemies .
» Jehovah my God has given me peace on all my borders . I have no enemies , and there is no danger of attack .
» Jehovah promised my father David : ‘ Your son , whom I will make king after you , will build a Temple for me . I have decided to build that Temple for the worship of Jehovah my God . ’
» Send your men to Lebanon to cut down cedars for me . My men will work with them . I will pay your men whatever you decide . You may already know , my men do not know how to cut down trees as well as yours do . «
Hiram was extremely pleased when he received Solomon's message . He said : » Praise Jehovah today for giving David such a wise son to succeed him as king of the great nation of Israel ! «
Then Hiram sent Solomon the following message : » I received your message . I am ready to do what you ask . I will provide the cedars and the pine trees .
» My men will bring the logs from Lebanon to the sea and will tie them together in rafts to float them down the coast to the place you choose . My men will untie them . There your men will take charge of them . On your part , I would like you to supply the food for my men . «
So Hiram supplied Solomon with all the cedar and pine logs he wanted .
Solomon provided Hiram with one hundred thousand bushels of wheat and one hundred and ten thousand gallons of pure olive oil every year to feed his men .
Jehovah kept his promise and gave Solomon wisdom . There was peace between Hiram and Solomon for they made a treaty with each other .
King Solomon drafted thirty thousand men as forced labor from all over Israel .
He appointed Adoniram to be in charge of them . He divided them into three groups of ten thousand men . Each group spent one month in Lebanon and two months back home .
Solomon also had eighty thousand stonecutters in the mountains . There were seventy thousand men to carry the stones .
He placed three thousand three hundred foremen there to supervise their work .
King Solomon command that they cut fine large stones for the foundation of the Temple .
Solomon's and Hiram's workers and men from the city of Gebal prepared the stones and the timber to build the Temple .
Solomon began work on the Temple . It was four hundred and eighty years after the people of Israel left Egypt , during the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel , in the second month , the month of Ziv .
The Temple Solomon built was ninety feet long , thirty feet wide , and forty-five feet high inside .
The entrance room was fifteen feet deep and thirty feet wide . It was as wide as the sanctuary .
He made windows for the Temple . Their openings were narrower on the outside than on the inside .
A third-story annex , seven and one half feet high , was built against the outside walls . It was on the sides and the back of the Temple .
Each room in the lowest story was seven and one half feet wide . The middle story was nine feet wide . The top story was ten and one half feet wide . The Temple wall on each floor was thinner than on the floor below , so that the rooms could rest on the wall without having their beams built into it .
The stones with which the Temple was built were prepared at the quarry . That way there was no noise made by hammers , axes , or any other iron tools as the Temple was built .
The entrance to the lowest story of the annex was on the south side of the Temple . It had stairs leading up to the second and third stories .
King Solomon finished building the Temple . He put in a ceiling made of beams and boards of cedar .
The three-story annex , each story seven and one half feet high , was built against the outside walls of the Temple . Cedar beams were used to join it to them .
Jehovah spoke to Solomon :
» If you obey all my laws and commands , I will do for you what I promised your father David .
» I will live among my people Israel in this Temple that you are building . I will never abandon them . «
Solomon finished building the Temple .
The inside walls were covered with cedar panels from the floor to the ceiling . The floor was made of pine .
An inner room , called the Most Holy Place , was built in the rear of the Temple . It was thirty feet long and was partitioned off by cedar boards reaching from the floor to the ceiling .
The room in front of the Most Holy Place was sixty feet long .
The cedar panels were decorated with carvings of gourds and flowers . The entire interior was covered with cedar . The stones of the walls could not be seen .
An inner room was built in the rear of the Temple . The Ark of the Covenant was to be placed there .
This inner room was thirty feet long , thirty feet wide , and thirty feet high , all covered with pure gold . The altar was covered with cedar panels .
The inside of the Temple was covered with gold . Gold chains were placed across the entrance of the inner room .
The whole interior of the Temple was covered with gold , as well as the altar in the Most Holy Place .
Two cherubim made of olive wood were placed in the Most Holy Place . Each one was fifteen feet tall .
Each had two wings , each wing was seven and one half feet long . The distance from one wing tip to the other was fifteen feet .
The other cherub was fifteen feet tall .
Both were the same size and shape .
They were placed side by side in the Most Holy Place . Their outstretched wings touched each other in the middle of the room , and the other two wings touched the walls .
The two cherubim were covered with gold .
The walls of the main room and of the inner room were all decorated with carved figures of cherubim , palm trees , and flowers .
Even the floor was covered with gold .
A double door made of olive wood was hung at the entrance of the Most Holy Place . There was a pointed arch on top of the doorway .
The doors were decorated with carved figures of cherubim , palm trees , and flowers . The doors , the cherubim , and the palm trees were covered with gold .
A rectangular doorframe of olive wood was made for the entrance to the main room .
There were two folding doors made of pine
and decorated with carved figures of cherubim , palm trees , and flowers , which were evenly covered with gold .
An inner court was built in front of the Temple . They enclosed it with walls that had one layer of cedar beams for every three layers of stone .
The foundation of the Temple was laid in the second month , the month of Ziv , in the fourth year of Solomon's reign .
In the eighth month , the month of Bul , in the eleventh year of Solomon's reign , the Temple was completely finished exactly as it had been planned . It took Solomon seven years to build it .
Solomon took thirteen years to build a palace for himself .
The Hall of the Forest of Lebanon was one hundred and fifty feet long , seventy-five feet wide , and forty-five feet high .
It had three rows of cedar pillars , fifteen in each row , with cedar beams resting on them . The ceiling was of cedar , extending over storerooms , which were supported by the pillars .
On each of the two sidewalls there were three rows of windows .
All the doors and doorframes were rectangular . There were three doors facing each other on opposite sides of the palace .
Solomon made the Hall of Pillars seventy-five feet long and forty-five feet wide . In front of the hall was an entrance hall with pillars .
He made the hall for the throne . It was a place where he could sit on his throne and judge . The hall was covered with cedar from floor to ceiling .
His own private quarters were in a different location than the hall containing the throne . They were similar in design . Solomon also built private quarters like this for his wife , Pharaoh's daughter .
From the foundation to the roof , all these buildings , including the large courtyard , were built with high-grade stone blocks . The stone blocks were cut to size and trimmed with saws on their inner and outer faces .
The foundation was made with large , high-grade expensive stones . Some were twelve feet and others fifteen feet long .
Above the foundation were cedar beams and high-grade expensive stone blocks , which were cut to size .
The large courtyard had three layers of cut stone blocks and a layer of cedar beams , like the inner courtyard of Jehovah’s Temple and the entrance hall .
King Solomon sent for a man named Huram , a craftsman living in the city of Tyre .
Huram was knowledgeable and skilled in making things out of copper . He was the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali . His father had been from Tyre . He went to do all of King Solomon’s work .
Huram cast two copper columns . Each one was twenty-seven feet tall and eighteen feet in circumference . They were placed at the entrance of the Temple .
He also made two copper crowns . Each one was seven and one half feet tall . They were to be placed on top of the columns .
The top of each column was decorated with a design of interwoven chains .
They had two rows of copper pomegranates .
The crowns on the top of the columns were shaped like lilies , six feet tall ,
and were placed on a rounded section which was above the chain design . There were two hundred pomegranates in two rows around each crown .
Huram placed these two copper columns in front of the entrance of the Temple . The column on the south side was named Jachin and the one on the north was named Boaz .
The lily-shaped copper crowns were on top of the columns . The work on the columns was completed .
Hiram made a round tank of copper , seven and one half feet deep , fifteen feet in diameter , and forty-five feet in circumference .
All around the outer edge of the rim of the tank were two rows of copper gourds . They were all cast in one piece with the rest of the tank .
The tank rested on the backs of twelve copper bulls that faced outward . Three faced in each direction .
The sides of the tank were three inches thick . Its rim was like the rim of a cup . It curved outward like the petals of a lily . The tank held about ten thousand gallons .
Huram also made ten copper carts . Each cart was six feet long , six feet wide , and four and one half feet high .
They were made of square panels set in frames .
There were figures of lions , bulls , and cherubim on the panels . And there were spiral relief figures on the frames above and underneath the lions and bulls .
Each cart had four copper wheels with copper axles . At the four corners were copper supports for a basin . The supports were decorated with spiral relief figures .
There was a circular frame on top for the basin . It projected eighteen inches upward from the top of the cart and seven inches down into it . It had carvings around it .
The wheels were under the panels . They were twenty-five inches high . The axles were of one piece with the carts .
The wheels were like chariot wheels . Their axles , rims , spokes , and hubs were all of copper .
There were four supports at the bottom corners of each cart . They were of one piece with the cart .
There was a nine-inch band around the top of each cart . Its supports and the panels were of one piece with the cart .
The supports and panels were decorated with figures of cherubim , lions , and palm trees , wherever there was space for them , with spiral figures all around .
This is how the carts were made . They were all alike , having the same size and shape .
Huram made ten basins , one for each cart . Each basin was six feet in diameter and held two hundred gallons .
He placed five of the carts on the south side of the Temple . The other five were placed on the north side . The tank was placed at the southeast corner .
Huram made the pots and spades and the basins . Huram finished all the work he did for King Solomon in the house of Jehovah .
The two pillars and the two cups of the crowns which were on the tops of the two pillars ; and the network covering the two cups of the crowns on the tops of the pillars ,
The four hundred apples for the network , two lines of apples for every network , covering the two cups of the crowns on the pillars ;
The ten bases , with the ten washing-vessels on them ;
The great water-vessel molten sea copper sea , with the twelve oxen under it ;
And the pots and the spades and the basins ; all the vessels which Huram made for King Solomon , for the house of Jehovah , were of polished brass .
He made them of liquid metal in the lowland district of the Jordan River . This was at the river crossing at Adama , between Succoth and Zarethan .
Solomon did not weigh all the utensils because so much copper was used . No one tried to determine how much the copper weighed .
Solomon made all the furnishings for Jehovah’s Temple : the gold altar , the gold table on which the bread of the presence was placed ,
lamps stands of pure gold , five on the south side and five on the north in front of the inner room , flowers , lamps , gold tongs ,
dishes , snuffers , bowls , saucers , incense burners of pure gold , the gold sockets for the doors of the inner room the Most Holy Place , and the doors of the temple .
All the work King Solomon did on Jehovah’s Temple was finished . He brought the holy things that belonged to his father David : the silver , gold , and utensils and put them in the storerooms of Jehovah’s Temple .
King Solomon summoned all the leaders of the tribes and clans of Israel to come to him in Jerusalem . They were to take Jehovah’s Ark of the Covenant from Zion , David's City , to the Temple .
They all assembled during the festival . It was the seventh month , the month of Ethanim .
As soon as all the elders gathered , the priests lifted the Ark
and carried it to the Temple . The Levites and the priests also moved the Tent of Jehovah’s presence and all its equipment to the Temple .
King Solomon and all the people of Israel assembled in front of the Ark and sacrificed a large number of sheep and cattle , too many to count .
Then the priests carried the Ark of the Covenant into the Temple and put it in the Most Holy Place , beneath the cherubim angel .
Their outstretched wings covered the box and the poles it was carried by .
The ends of the poles could be seen by anyone standing directly in front of the Most Holy Place , but from nowhere else .
There was nothing inside the Ark of the Covenant except the two stone tablets that Moses had placed there at Mount Sinai , when Jehovah made a covenant with the people of Israel as they were coming from Egypt .
As the priests were leaving the Temple , it was suddenly filled with a cloud .
It shined with the dazzling light of Jehovah’s presence . They could not go back in to perform their duties .
Solomon prayed : » Jehovah , you have placed the sun in the sky , yet you have chosen to live in clouds and darkness .
» Now I have built a majestic temple for you , a place for you to live in for a very long time . «
King Solomon turned to face the people standing there . He asked God's blessing on them .
He said : » Praise Jehovah the God of Israel ! He kept the promise he made to my father David , when he told him :
» ‘ Since the time I brought my people out of Egypt , I have not chosen any city in all the land of Israel in which a temple should be built where I would be worshiped . But I chose you , David , to rule my people . ’ «
Solomon continued : » My father David planned to build a temple for the worship of Jehovah the God of Israel ,
» ‘ Jehovah said to him : ‘ You were right in wanting to build a temple for me .
» ‘ However you will never build it . It is your son who will build my temple . ’ «
» Now Jehovah has kept his promise . I have succeeded my father as king of Israel . And I have built the Temple for the worship of Jehovah the God of Israel .
» I also provided a place in the Temple for the Ark of the Covenant containing the stone tablets of the covenant Jehovah made with our ancestors when he brought them out of Egypt . «
In the presence of the people Solomon stood in front of the altar . He raised his arms
and prayed : » Jehovah God of Israel , there is no god like you in heaven above or on earth below ! You keep your covenant with your people and show them your love when they live in wholehearted obedience to you .
» You kept the promise you made to my father David . Every word has been fulfilled .
» Jehovah , God of Israel , I pray that you will also keep the other promise you made to my father when you told him there would always be one of his descendants ruling as king of Israel , provided they obeyed you as carefully as he did .
» So now , O God of Israel , let your word come true that you promised to my father David , your servant .
» Can you , O God , really live on earth ? Not even heaven or the heaven of heavens is large enough to hold you . How can this Temple I have built be large enough ?
» Jehovah my God , I am your servant . Listen to my prayer . Grant the requests I make to you today .
» Watch over this Temple day and night . For this is the place where you have chosen to be worshiped . Hear me when I face this Temple and pray .
» Hear my prayers and the prayers of your people . In your home in heaven hear us and forgive us .
» When a person is accused of wronging another and is brought to your altar in this Temple to take an oath that he is innocent ,
» O Jehovah , listen in heaven and judge your servants . Punish the guilty one , as he deserves . Justify the one who is innocent .
» When your people Israel have sinned against you their enemies defeat them . They can turn to you and come to this Temple , humbly praying to you for forgiveness .
Listen to them in heaven . Forgive the sins of your people and bring them back to the land that you gave to their ancestors .
» When you hold back the rain because your people have sinned against you . And when they repent in this Temple , humbly praying to you ,
listen to them in heaven . Forgive the sins of the king and of the people of Israel , and teach them to do what is right . Then , O Jehovah , send rain on this land of yours , which you gave to your people as a permanent possession .
» When there is famine in the land or an epidemic or scorching winds or swarms of locusts , or when their enemies attack your people , or when disease or sickness among them destroys the crops ,
listen to their prayers . If any of your people Israel , out of heartfelt sorrow , stretch out their hands in prayer toward this Temple ,
hear their prayer . Listen to them in your home in heaven , help them and forgive them . You alone know the thoughts of the human heart . Deal with each person , as he deserves ,
so that your people may obey you all the time they live in the land you gave to our ancestors .
» When a foreigner who lives in a distant land hears of your fame and of the great things you have done for your people and comes to worship you and to pray at this Temple ,
» For they will have news of your great name and your strong hand and your out-stretched arm . When he comes to pray in this house :
» Listen to him and give him his desire . Let all the peoples of the earth know about your name . Let them worship you as your people Israel , and that they may see that this house which I have built is truly named by your name .
» When your people go to war against their enemies , they pray to you , O Jehovah , toward the city you have chosen and the temple I built for your name .
» Hear their prayer for mercy in heaven , and do what is right for them .
» They may sin against you , for everyone sins . You may become angry with them and hand them over to an enemy far or near who takes them to another country as captives .
» If they come to their senses and are sorry for what they have done , and plead with you in the land where they are captives , saying : We have sinned . We have done wrong . We have been wicked .
» If they change their attitude toward you in the land of their enemies where they are captives , if they pray to you toward the land that you gave their ancestors , and the city you have chosen , and the temple I have built for your name ,
then in heaven , the place where you live , hear their prayer for mercy . Do what is right for them .
» Forgive your people , who have sinned against you . Forgive all their wrongs when they rebelled against you . Cause those who captured them to have mercy on them .
» They are your own people . You brought them out of Egypt from the middle of an iron smelter .
» May your eyes always see my plea and your people Israel's plea so that you will listen to them whenever they call on you .
» You Jehovah set them apart from all the people of the world . They are your own as you promised through your servant Moses when you brought our ancestors out of Egypt . «
When Solomon finished praying this prayer for mercy to Jehovah , he stood in front of Jehovah’s altar , where he had been kneeling with his hands stretched out toward heaven .
Then he stood and in a loud voice blessed the entire assembly of Israel :
" THANKS TO JEHOVAH ! He has given his people Israel rest , as he has promised . None of the good promises he made through his servant Moses has failed to come true .
» May Jehovah our God be with us as he was with our ancestors . May he not leave us or abandon us .
» May he bend our hearts toward him . Then we will follow him and obey his commands , laws , and rules , which he commanded our ancestors to obey .
» May these words I have prayed to Jehovah be near Jehovah our God day and night . Then he will give his people Israel and me justice every day as it is needed .
» In this way all the people of the earth may know that Jehovah is God and there is no other god .
» Let your hearts be committed to Jehovah our God . Then you will live by his laws and keep his commands as you have today . «
Then the king and all Israel offered sacrifices to Jehovah .
Solomon sacrificed twenty-two thousand cattle and one hundred twenty thousand sheep as fellowship offerings to Jehovah . So the king and all the people of Israel dedicated Jehovah’s Temple .
On that day the king designated the courtyard in front of Jehovah’s Temple as a holy place . He sacrificed the burnt offerings , grain offerings , and the fat from the fellowship offerings because the copper altar in front of Jehovah was too small to hold all of them .
At that time Solomon and all Israel celebrated the festival . A large crowd had come from the territory between the border of Hamath and the River of Egypt to be near Jehovah our God for seven days .
On the eighth day he dismissed the people . They blessed the king and went to their tents . They rejoiced with cheerful hearts for all the blessings Jehovah had given his servant David and his people Israel .
Solomon finished building Jehovah’s Temple , the royal palace , and everything else he wanted to build .
Jehovah came to him again in a vision just as he had done at Gibeon .
Jehovah said : » I have heard your prayers and your supplication you made . I have made this house holy . I put my name there forever . My eyes and my heart will be there at all times .
» As for you , if you will walk before me , as David your father did , uprightly and with a true heart , doing what I have given you orders to do , keeping my laws and my decisions ;
» I will make the seat of your rule over Israel certain forever . I gave my word to David your father . I said : You will never be without a man to be king in Israel .
» But if you turn from my ways , you or your children , and do not keep my orders and my laws which I have put before you , but go and make yourselves servants to other gods and give them worship :
» I will have Israel cut off from the land I gave them . I will abandon this house even though I have made it holy for myself . I will put you out of my sight . Israel will be a public example , and a word of shame among all peoples .
This house will become a mass of broken walls . Everyone who goes by will be overcome with wonder at it and make whistling sounds . They will say : Why has Jehovah done this to this land and to this house ?
» ‘ The answer will be : ‘ Because they turned away from Jehovah their God . The one who took their fathers out of the land of Egypt . They took for themselves other gods and gave them worship and became their servants : that is why Jehovah has sent this evil on them . ’ «
It took twenty years for Solomon to build two houses , the Temple of Jehovah and the king's house .
Hiram , king of Tyre , had given Solomon cedar-trees and cypress-trees and gold , as much as he needed . King Solomon gave Hiram twenty towns in the land of Galilee .
But when Hiram came from Tyre to see the towns that Solomon had given him , he was not pleased with them .
He said : » What sort of towns are these you have given me , my brother ? « So they were named the land of Cabul , to this day .
Hiram sent the king a hundred and twenty talent of gold .
King Solomon used forced labor to build the Temple and the palace , to fill in land on the east side of the city , and to build the city wall . He also used it to rebuild the cities of Hazor , Megiddo , and Gezer .
The king of Egypt attacked Gezer and captured it . They killed its inhabitants and set fire to the city . He gave it as a wedding present to his daughter when she married Solomon .
Solomon rebuilt it . Using his forced labor , Solomon also rebuilt Lower Beth Horon ,
Baalath , Tamar in the wilderness of Judah ,
the cities where his supplies were kept , the cities for his horses and chariots , and everything else he wanted to build in Jerusalem , in Lebanon , and elsewhere in his kingdom .
Solomon used the descendants of the people of Canaan whom the Israelites had not killed when they took possession of their land as his forced labor . These included Amorites , Hittites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites .
Their descendants continue to be slaves down to the present time .
Solomon did not make slaves of Israelites . They served as his soldiers , officers , commanders , chariot captains , and cavalry .
There were five hundred and fifty officials in charge of the forced labor working on Solomon's various building projects .
Solomon filled in the land on the east side of the city , after his wife , the daughter of the king of Egypt , had moved from David's City to the palace Solomon built for her .
Three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar he had built to Jehovah . He also burned incense to Jehovah . He finished building the Temple .
King Solomon also built a fleet of ships at Eziongeber . This is near Elath on the shore of the Gulf of Aqaba , in the land of Edom .
King Hiram sent experienced sailors from his fleet to serve with Solomon's men .
They sailed to the land of Ophir and brought back to Solomon about sixteen tons of gold .
The queen of Sheba heard of Solomon's fame . She traveled to Jerusalem to test him with difficult questions .
So she came to Jerusalem with a very large caravan . The camels carried spices and very much gold and precious stones . When she approached Solomon , she talked about everything she had on her mind heart .
Solomon answered all her questions . Nothing was hidden from the king that he did not explain to her .
When the queen of Sheba perceived all the Wisdom of Solomon , the house that he had built ,
the food of his table , the seating of his servants , the attendance of his waiters and their attire , his cupbearers , and his stairway by which he went up to the house of Jehovah , she was overwhelmed .
She said to the king : » The report I heard in my country about your acts and your wisdom was true .
» But I had no faith in what was said about you , till I came and saw for myself . Now I see that what I was told was not the half of it ! Your wisdom and your wealth are much greater than they said .
» Happy are your wives , happy are your servants whose place is ever before you , hearing your words of wisdom .
» Praise Jehovah your God ! He delighted in you and made you king of Israel . Jehovah’s love for Israel is long lasting , he has made you king , to be their judge in righteousness . «
She gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold , and a great store of spices and jewels . Never again was such a wealth of spices seen as that which the queen of Sheba gave King Solomon .
Hiram's fleet that brought gold from Ophir also brought a large quantity of sandalwood and precious stones from Ophir .
With the sandalwood possibly the algum tree the king made supports for Jehovah’s Temple and the royal palace , and lyres and harps for the singers . Never again was sandalwood like this imported into Israel , nor has any been seen there to this day .
King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all her desire . Whatever she requested in addition to what he gave her freely from the impulse of his heart . She and her servants went back to her country .
Each year King Solomon received about twenty-five tons of gold .
This was in addition to what came to him from the business of the traders , and from all the kings of the Arabians , and from the rulers of the country .
Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold . About fifteen pounds of gold went into each shield .
He made three hundred smaller body-covers of hammered gold . Three pounds of gold was in every cover . The king put them in the house of the Woods of Lebanon .
The king made a great ivory throne plated with the best gold .
There were six steps going up to it . The top of it was round at the back . There were arms on the two sides of the throne and two lions by the side of the arms .
Twelve lions were placed on one side and on the other side on the six steps : there was nothing like it in any kingdom .
All King Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold . All the vessels of the house of the Woods of Lebanon were of the best gold . Not one was of silver , for no one gave a thought to silver in the days of King Solomon .
For the king had Tarshish-ships at sea with the ships of Hiram . Once every three years the Tarshish-ships came with gold and silver and ivory and apes monkeys and peacocks .
King Solomon was greater than all the kings of the earth in wealth and in wisdom .
They came from all over the earth to see Solomon and to listen to his wisdom , which God had put in his heart .
Everyone took presents such as vessels of silver and vessels of gold , and robes , and coats of metal , and spices , and horses , and beasts of transport , regularly year by year .
Solomon gathered war-carriages and horsemen . He had one thousand , four hundred carriages and twelve thousand horsemen , whom he kept , some in the carriage-towns and some with the king at Jerusalem .
The king made silver as common as stones in Jerusalem and cedars like the sycamore-trees of the lowlands in number .
Solomon's string of horses came from Egypt and from Kue . The king's traders got them at a price from Kue .
A war-carriage might be obtained from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver , and a horse for a hundred and fifty . They got them at the same rate for all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram .
Solomon loved many women . They were of the Moabites , Ammonites , Edomites , Zidonians , and Hittites .
Jehovah warned the children of Israel about these nations . He said : » You are not to take wives from them and they are not to take wives from you . They will certainly turn your hearts to go after their gods . « Solomon loved his wives anyway .
He had seven hundred wives , daughters of kings , and three hundred other wives . His wives influenced his heart to turn away .
When Solomon was old he allowed his heart to be turned away to other gods by his wives . His heart was no longer true to Jehovah his God as the heart of his father David had been .
Solomon went after Ashtoreth , the goddess of the Zidonians , and Milcom , the disgusting god of the Ammonites .
Solomon did evil in the eyes of Jehovah . He did not walk in Jehovah’s ways with all his heart as David his father did .
Then Solomon put up a high place for Chemosh , the disgusting god of Moab , in the mountain near Jerusalem . And for Molech , the disgusting god worshipped by the children of Ammon .
He did likewise for all his strange wives , who made offerings with burning of perfumes to their gods .
Jehovah was angry with Solomon . This is because his heart turned away from Jehovah , the God of Israel , who had twice come to him in a vision .
Jehovah had given him orders about this very thing that he was not to go after other gods . But he did not obey the orders of Jehovah .
So Jehovah said to Solomon : » Because you have done this , and have not kept the agreement and laws I gave you , I will take the kingdom away from you by force and will give it to your servant .
» I will not do it in your lifetime , because of your father David , but I will take it from your son .
» Still I will not take the entire kingdom from him . I will give one tribe to your son , because of my servant David , and because of Jerusalem , the town of my selection . «
Jehovah sent Hadad the Edomite to make trouble for Solomon . He was of the king's seed in Edom .
When David had sent destruction on Edom , and Joab , the commander of the army went to bury the dead . They put to death every male in Edom .
Joab and all Israel stayed there six months until they had destroyed every male in Edom .
Hadad was a young boy at the time . He and some of his father's Edomite servants fled to Egypt .
They left Midian and went to Paran . Taking some men from Paran with them , they went to Pharaoh the king of Egypt . Pharaoh gave Hadad a home , a food allowance , and land .
Pharaoh approved of Hadad . So he gave Hadad his sister-in-law , the sister of Queen Tahpenes , to be Hadad's wife .
Tahpenes' sister had a son named Genubath . Tahpenes presented the boy to Pharaoh in the palace , and Genubath lived in the palace among Pharaoh's children .
When the news reached Hadad in Egypt that David had died and that Joab the commander of the army was dead , Hadad said to the king : » Let me go back to my own country . «
» Why ? « The king asked . » Have I failed to give you something ? Is that why you want to go back home ? « Hadad answered : » Just let me go . « He went back to his country . As king of Edom , Hadad was an evil , bitter enemy of Israel .
God also caused Rezon son of Eliada to turn against Solomon . Rezon had fled from his master , King Hadadezer of Zobah ,
and had become the leader of a gang of outlaws . This happened after David defeated Hadadezer and slaughtered his Syrian allies . Rezon and his gang lived in Damascus , where his followers made him king of Syria .
He was trouble to Israel all through the days of Solomon . This is the damage Hadad did : he was cruel to Israel while he was ruler over Edom .
Jeroboam rebelled against the king . He was the son of Nebat , an Ephraimite from Zeredah , a servant of Solomon , whose mother was Zeruah , a widow .
This is how he rebelled : Solomon was building the Millo supporting terraces and making good the damaged parts of the town of his father David .
Jeroboam was a capable and responsible man . Solomon saw that he was a good worker and made him overseer of all the work given to the sons of Joseph .
When Jeroboam was going out of Jerusalem , the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite came across him on the road . Ahijah was wearing a new robe . They were by themselves in the open country .
Ahijah took his new robe in his hands and tore it into twelve pieces .
He said to Jeroboam : » Take ten of the parts , for this is what Jehovah said : ‘ I will take the kingdom away from Solomon by force . I will give ten tribes to you .
» ‘ But one tribe will be his because of my servant David , and because of Jerusalem . Out of the tribes of Israel he will have the town I have made mine .
» ‘ I am going to do this because Solomon has rejected me and has worshiped foreign gods . Astarte , the goddess of Sidon ; Chemosh , the god of Moab ; and Molech , the god of Ammon . Solomon disobeyed me . He has done wrong ! He has not obeyed my laws and commands as his father David did .
» ‘ I will not take the entire kingdom away from Solomon . I will keep him in power as long as he lives . This I will do for the sake of my servant David , whom I chose and who obeyed my laws and commands .
» ‘ I will take the kingdom away from Solomon's son and will give you ten tribes .
» ‘ I will let Solomon's son keep one tribe . That way I will always have a descendant of my servant David ruling in Jerusalem , the city I have chosen as the place where I am worshiped .
» ‘ Jeroboam , I will make you king of Israel . You will rule over all the territory that you want .
» ‘ If you obey me completely I will always be with you . You must live by my laws , and win my approval by doing what I command , as my servant David did . I will make you king of Israel and will make sure that your descendants rule after you , just as I have done for David .
» ‘ Because of Solomon's sin I will punish the descendants of David , but not forever . ’ «
For this reason Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam . Jeroboam escaped to King Shishak of Egypt and stayed there until Solomon's death .
Everything else that Solomon did , his career , and his wisdom , are all recorded in The History of Solomon .
He was king in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years .
He died and was buried in David's City . His son Rehoboam succeeded him as king .
Rehoboam went to Shechem . All the people of northern Israel gathered to make him king .
Jeroboam son of Nebat went to Egypt to escape from King Solomon . When he heard this news he returned from Egypt .
The people of the northern tribes sent for him . Then they all went together to Rehoboam and said to him :
» Your father Solomon treated us harshly and placed heavy burdens on us . If you make these burdens lighter and make life easier for us , we will be your loyal subjects . «
» Come back in three days and I will give you my answer , « he replied . So they left .
Then King Rehoboam consulted elders who had been with Solomon his father when he was living . He said : » In your opinion , what answer am I to give to these people ? «
They said to him : » If you will be a servant to this people today , caring for them and giving them a favorable answer , then they will be your servants for ever . «
But he paid no attention to the opinion of the elders . He went to the young men who were his advisors :
» What is your opinion ? « He asked : » What answer are we to give to this people ? They want me to lighten the burdens placed on them by my father . «
His young advisors said : » This is the answer to give to the people who came to you saying : ‘ Your father put a hard yoke on us ; will you make it less ? ’ ’ Say to them : ‘ My little finger is thicker than my father's body . ’
» ‘ If my father put a hard yoke on you , I will make it harder ! My father gave you punishment with whips , but I will give you blows with snakes . ’ «
So all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day just as the king ordered .
The king gave them a harsh answer . He paid no attention to the suggestion of the elders .
He gave them the answer suggested by the young advisors . He said : » My father made your yoke hard , but I will make it harder ! My father gave you punishment with whips , but I will give it with snakes . «
The king did not listen to the people . This came about by Jehovah’s purpose , so that what he had said by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam , son of Nebat , might be fulfilled .
When all Israel realized that the king would not respond to their request , the people in answer said to the king : » What share do we have in David ? What is our heritage in the son of Jesse ? To your tents , O Israel ; now see to your people , David . « So Israel went away to their tents .
Rehoboam was still king over those of the children of Israel who were living in the towns of Judah .
Then King Rehoboam sent Adoniram , the overseer of the forced work . He was stoned to death by all Israel . King Rehoboam went quickly and got into his carriage to escape to Jerusalem .
Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day .
When all Israel heard that Jeroboam had come back , they requested a meeting of the people . At that meeting they made him king over Israel . There was none who followed the house of David except the tribe of Judah .
When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem , he called together one hundred and eighty thousand of the best soldiers from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin . He wanted to go to war and restore his control over the northern tribes of Israel .
But God told the prophet Shemaiah :
» Give this message to Rehoboam and to all the people of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin :
» ‘ Do not attack the people of Israel , your own relatives . All of you go home . What has happened is my will . ’ « They all obeyed Jehovah’s command and went home .
King Jeroboam of Israel fortified the town of Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there for a while . Then he left and fortified the town of Penuel .
He thought to himself : » The way things are my people will go to Jerusalem and offer sacrifices to Jehovah at the Temple there .
» They will transfer their allegiance to King Rehoboam of Judah and will kill me . «
After asking for advice , the king made two golden calves . He said : You have been worshiping in Jerusalem long enough . Israel , here are your gods who brought you out of Egypt .
He placed one in Bethel and the other in Dan .
This became Israel’s sin , worshiping the golden calves . The people went as far as Dan to worship the one calf .
Jeroboam built worship sites on hilltops . He appointed men who were not descended from Levi to be priests .
Jeroboam appointed a festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth month , just like the festival in Judah . He went to the altar in Bethel to sacrifice to the calves he had made . He appointed priests from the illegal worship sites to serve in Bethel .
He went to his altar in Bethel to burn an offering on the fifteenth day of the eighth month , the festival he invented for the Israelites .
A man of God from Judah went to Bethel . He arrived there while Jeroboam was at the altar ready to offer a sacrifice .
He actually spoke against the altar : » O altar , altar , this is what Jehovah says : ‘ A child , whose name will be Josiah , will be born to the family of David . He will slaughter the priests serving at the pagan altars who offer sacrifices on you . He will burn human bones on you . ’ «
The prophet went on to say : » This altar will fall apart . The ashes on it will be scattered . Then you will know that Jehovah has spoken through me . «
King Jeroboam heard this . He pointed his outstretched hand at him and ordered : » Seize that man ! « At once the king's arm became paralyzed so that he could not pull it back .
The altar suddenly fell apart and the ashes spilled to the ground . This is what the prophet predicted in the name of Jehovah .
King Jeroboam said to the prophet : » Please pray to Jehovah your God for me , and ask him to heal my arm ! « The prophet prayed to Jehovah and the king's arm was healed .
Then the king said to the prophet : » Come home with me and have something to eat . I will reward you for what you have done . «
The prophet answered : Even if you gave me half of your wealth , I would not go with you or eat or drink anything with you .
I was ordered by the word of Jehovah , he said : » You are not to take food or a drink of water , and you are not to go back the way you came . «
So he went another way , and not by the way he came to Bethel .
There was an old prophet living in Bethel . His sons told him what the man of God had done that day in Bethel . They reported what he said to the king .
Their father asked : » Which way did he go ? « His sons saw which way the man of God went .
So the prophet said to his sons : » Saddle the donkey for me . « So they saddled the donkey and he mounted it .
He rode after the man of God . He found him sitting under an oak tree . » Are you the man of God who came from Judah ? » He asked . « I am . « Came his reply .
He said : » Come back to the house with me and have a meal . «
But the man of God from Judah replied : » I may not go back with you or go into your house . I will not take food or a drink of water with you in this place .
» Jehovah said to me : ‘ You are not to take food or water there , or go back again by the way you came . ’ «
Then he said : » I am a prophet like you . An angel said to me by the word of Jehovah , Take him back with you and give him food and water . « But he lied to him .
So he went back with him , and had a meal in his house and a drink of water .
But while they were seated at the table , the word of Jehovah came to the old prophet who had brought him back .
Crying out to the man of God who came from Judah , he said : » Jehovah says , ‘ because you have gone against the voice of Jehovah , and have not done as Jehovah ordered you ,
but have come back , and have taken food and water in this place where he said you were to take no food or water ; your dead body will not be put to rest with your fathers . ’ «
After the meal he made the donkey ready for the prophet whom he had taken back .
He went on his way . A lion met him on the road and jumped him and killed him . His dead body was stretched in the road with the donkey by its side . The lion was by the body .
Some people who passed by saw the body stretched out in the road with the lion by its side . They brought the news to the town where the old prophet lived .
The old prophet heard about it and said : » That is the prophet who disobeyed Jehovah’s command ! Jehovah sent the lion to attack and kill him , just as Jehovah said he would . «
He said to his sons : » Saddle my donkey for me . « They did so .
He rode away to find the prophet's body lying on the road . The donkey and the lion were still standing by it . The lion had not eaten the body or attacked the donkey .
The old prophet picked up the body and brought it back to Bethel on the donkey . There he mourned over it and buried it .
He buried it in his own family grave . He and his sons mourned over it , saying : » Oh my brother , my brother ! «
After the burial the prophet said to his sons : » When I die , bury me in this grave and lay my body next to his .
» The words that he spoke at Jehovah’s command against the altar in Bethel and against all the places of worship in the towns of Samaria will surely come true . «
King Jeroboam of Israel still did not turn from his evil ways . He continued to choose priests from ordinary families to serve at the altars he had built . He ordained as priest anyone who wanted to be one .
This was the sin of the house of Jeroboam . It brought about its ruin and total destruction from the face of the earth .
King Jeroboam's son Abijah became sick .
Jeroboam said to his wife : » Disguise yourself so that no one will recognize you , and go to Shiloh . That is where the prophet Ahijah lives . He is the one who said I would be king of Israel .
» Take him ten loaves of bread , some cakes , and a jar of honey . Ask him what is going to happen to our son . He will tell you . «
She went to Ahijah's home in Shiloh . Old age had made Ahijah blind .
Jehovah told him : » Jeroboam's wife is coming to ask you about her son , for he is sick . « Jehovah told Ahijah what to say . Jeroboam's wife pretended to be someone else when she arrived there .
Ahijah heard her coming in the door and said : » Come in . I know you are Jeroboam's wife . Why do you pretend to be someone else ? I have bad news for you .
» Go and tell Jeroboam that this is what Jehovah , the God of Israel , says to him : I chose you from among the people and made you the ruler of my people Israel .
» I took the kingdom away from David's descendants and gave it to you . You have not been like my servant David . He was completely loyal to me . He obeyed my commands , and did only what I approve of .
» You have committed far greater sins than those who ruled before you . You have rejected me and have aroused my anger by making idols and metal images to worship .
» I will bring disaster on the house of Jeroboam . I will kill all your male descendants , young and old alike . I will get rid of your family . They will be swept away like dung .
» Dogs will eat members of your family who die in the city . Vultures will eat any who die in the open country . I , Jehovah , have spoken ! «
Ahijah went on to say to Jeroboam's wife : » Go back home . As soon as you enter the town , your son will die .
» All the people of Israel will mourn for him and bury him . He will be the only member of Jeroboam's family who will be properly buried for he is the only one with whom Jehovah , the God of Israel , is pleased .
» Jehovah will place a king over Israel who will put an end to Jeroboam's house .
» Jehovah will punish Israel , and she will shake like a reed shaking in a stream . He will uproot the people of Israel from this good land that he gave to their ancestors . He will scatter them beyond the Euphrates River , because they have aroused his anger by making idols of the goddess Asherah .
» Jehovah will abandon Israel because Jeroboam sinned and led the people of Israel into sin . «
Jeroboam's wife went back to Tirzah . Just as she entered her home , the child died .
The people of Israel mourned for him and buried him . This is as Jehovah said through his servant , the prophet Ahijah .
Everything else that King Jeroboam did , the wars he fought and how he ruled , are all recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel .
Jeroboam ruled as king for twenty-two years . He died and was buried . His son Nadab succeeded him as king .
Solomon's son Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king of Judah . He ruled seventeen years in Jerusalem , the city Jehovah chose from all the territory of Israel as the place where he was to be worshiped . Rehoboam's mother was Naamah from Ammon .
The people of Judah sinned against Jehovah . They did more to arouse his anger against them than all their ancestors had done .
They built places of worship for false gods . They put up stone pillars and symbols of Asherah to worship on the hills and under shady trees .
There were also male cult prostitutes in the temples of idols throughout the land . The people of Judah practiced all the disgusting practices done by the nations that Jehovah forced out of the Israelites' way .
King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem in the fifth year of Rehoboam’s reign .
He took the treasures from Jehovah’s Temple and the royal palace . He took them all . He took all the gold shields Solomon had made .
King Rehoboam replaced them with bronze shields and entrusted them to the officers responsible for guarding the palace gates .
The guards carried the shields every time the king went to the Temple and then returned them to the guardroom .
The rest of the acts of Rehoboam , and everything he did are recorded in the book of the History of the Kings of Judah .
There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days .
Rehoboam went to rest with his fathers , and was buried with them in the city of David . His mother's name was Naamah , an Ammonite woman . And Abijam his son became king in his place .
In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam , the son of Nebat , Abijam became king over Judah .
He ruled three years as king in Jerusalem . His mother's name was Maacah , the daughter of Abishalom .
He was not completely loyal to Jehovah his God as his great-grandfather David had been . He committed the same sins as his father did .
For David's sake Jehovah his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem by raising Abijam a son to rule after him to keep Jerusalem secure .
Jehovah did this because David had done what was right in Jehovah’s eyes . He obeyed his commandments , except in the case of Uriah the Hittite .
Abijam continued the war that Rehoboam and Jeroboam started . There was war throughout Abijam's lifetime .
Everything else that Abijah did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah .
Then Abijam went to rest with his fathers , and they buried him in the earth in the town of David . Asa his son became king in his place .
Jeroboam had been king of Israel twenty years . Asa became king of Judah .
He was king for forty-one years in Jerusalem . His mother's name was Maacah , the daughter of Abishalom .
Asa did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah , as David his father did .
He banished perverted persons from the land . He removed those used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods . He removed all the idols his fathers had made .
He would not let Maacah his mother be queen , because she had made a disgusting image for Asherah . Asa had the obscene image cut down and burned by the Kidron Stream .
The high places were not taken away . Nevertheless Asa’s heart was true to Jehovah all his life .
He brought into the Temple of Jehovah all the things he and his father made holy , silver and gold and vessels .
There was war between Asa and Baasha , king of Israel , through out their reigns .
And Baasha , king of Israel , went up against Judah . He fortified Ramah in order to prevent anyone from going out or in to Asa the king of Judah .
Then Asa took all the silver and gold still stored in Jehovah’s Temple , and in the king's house , and delivered them , in the care of his servants , to Ben-hadad , son of Tabrimmon , son of Rezon , king of Aram , at Damascus . He said :
Let there be an agreement between us just as there was between my father and your father . I have sent you an offering of silver and gold . End your agreement with Baasha , king of Israel that he may give up attacking me .
Ben-hadad agreed to King Asa’s request and sent his armies to attack Israel . He conquered Ijon and Dan and Abel-beth-maacah , and all Chinneroth as far as the land of Naphtali .
When Baasha heard this he stopped fortifying Ramah and withdrew to Tirzah .
Then King Asa issued an order to all Judah . Every man came to carry away the stone and the timber Baasha used to fortify Ramah . King Asa used them for building Geba in the land of Benjamin , and Mizpah .
The rest of the events of Asa’s reign , the extent of his power and the names of the cities he built are all recorded in the Book of the History of the Kings of Judah . His feet became diseased , as he grew old .
So Asa went to rest with his fathers and was buried in the town of David his father . Jehoshaphat his son became king in his place .
Nadab , the son of Jeroboam , became king over Israel in the second year that Asa was king of Judah ; and he was king of Israel for two years .
He did evil in the eyes of Jehovah . He copied the evil ways of his father . He made Israel sin so much that they provoked Jehovah to anger with their idols .
And Baasha , the son of Ahijah , of the family of Issachar , made a secret design against him , attacking him at Gibbethon , a town of the Philistines . Nadab and the armies of Israel were making war on Gibbethon .
In the third year of the rule of Asa , king of Judah , Baasha put him to death , and became king in his place .
When he became king , he sent destruction on all the offspring of Jeroboam . He killed every person of the family of Jeroboam according to the word of Jehovah as stated by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite .
This happened because Jeroboam aroused the anger of Jehovah , the God of Israel , by the sins he committed and that he caused Israel to commit .
Everything else that Nadab did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel .
King Asa of Judah and King Baasha of Israel were constantly at war as long as they reigned .
In the third year of the reign of King Asa of Judah , Baasha son of Ahijah became king of all Israel . He ruled in Tirzah for twenty-four years .
Like King Jeroboam before him , he sinned against Jehovah and led Israel into sin .
Jehovah spoke to the prophet Jehu son of Hanani and gave him this message to give to Baasha :
» I lifted you out of the dust and made you ruler over my people Israel . You have gone the way of Jeroboam . You made my people Israel do evil , moving me to wrath by their sins .
» Truly , I will take away the family of Baasha . I will make your family like the family of Jeroboam , the son of Nebat .
» Dogs will eat anyone of the family of Baasha who dies in town . The birds of the air will eat anyone who dies in the open country . «
The rest of the acts of Baasha , what he did , and his power , are recorded in the book of the History of the Kings of Israel .
Baasha rested with his fathers . He was buried at Tirzah ; and Elah his son became king in his place .
The word of Jehovah came to the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani . This was a warning against Baasha and his family because of all the evil he did in the eyes of Jehovah . He made Jehovah angry by the work of his hands , because he was like the family of Jeroboam , and because he killed him .
In the twenty-sixth year that Asa was king of Judah , Elah , the son of Baasha , became king of Israel in Tirzah . He was king for two years .
His servant Zimri , commander of half his war-carriages made plans to kill him . He was in Tirzah , drinking hard at the house of Arza , controller of the king's house in Tirzah .
Zimri attacked and killed him . It was the twenty-seventh year that Asa was king of Judah .
Immediately after he became king and took his place on the throne of the kingdom , he put to death all the family of Baasha . Not one male child survived .
So Zimri destroyed the entire family of Baasha as Jehovah promised through the prophet Jehu .
This happened because of the sins of Baasha , and the sins of Elah his son , and because of all the sins they led Israel to commit . It aroused the anger of Jehovah the God of Israel .
The rest of the acts of Elah are recorded in the book of the History of the Kings of Israel .
In the twenty-seventh year of Asa , king of Judah , Zimri was king for seven days in Tirzah . The people were attacking Gibbethon in the land of the Philistines .
The Israelites in the camp heard it said : » Zimri plotted against the king and killed him . « So all Israel made Omri , the captain of the army , king that day there in the camp .
Then Omri went up from Gibbethon , with all the army of Israel , and they attacked Tirzah , Israel’s capital .
Zimri saw that the city had fallen . So he went into the palace's inner fortress and set the palace on fire . He died in the flames .
This happened because of his sins against Jehovah . Like his predecessor Jeroboam , he displeased Jehovah by his own sins and by leading Israel into sin .
Everything else that Zimri did , including the account of his conspiracy , is recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel .
Then the army of Israel was divided into two factions . Half of the army followed Tibni , son of Ginath , and wanted to make him king . The other half followed Omri .
But the half that followed Omri was stronger than the half that followed Tibni , Ginath's son . Tibni died and Omri became king .
Omri began to rule Israel in Asa's thirty-first year as king of Judah . He ruled for twelve years , six of them in Tirzah .
Omri bought a hill from Shemer for one hundred and fifty pounds of silver . He fortified the hill and built the city of Samaria on it . He named the city after its former owner , Shemer .
Omri did what Jehovah considered evil . He did more evil things than all the kings before him .
He lived exactly like Jeroboam , Nebat's son . He sinned and led Israel to sin with worthless idols . The Israelites made Jehovah the God of Israel furious .
Everything else about Omri is written in the official records of the kings of Israel .
Omri rested with his fathers , and was buried in Samaria . Ahab his son became king in his place .
In the thirty-eighth year that Asa was king of Judah , Ahab , the son of Omri , became king over Israel . Ahab was king in Samaria for twenty-two years .
Ahab , the son of Omri , did evil in the eyes of Jehovah , even worse than all who went before him !
It was as if he copied the evil ways of Jeroboam , the son of Nebat . He took as his wife Jezebel , daughter of Ethbaal , king of Zidon , and became a servant and worshipper of Baal .
He built an altar for Baal in the house of Baal that he built in Samaria .
Ahab made an image of Asherah . He did more than all the kings of Israel before him to make Jehovah , the God of Israel , angry .
In his days Hiel rebuilt Jericho . He laid its foundation at the price of Abiram , his oldest son , and he put its doors in place at the price of his youngest son Segub . This was according to the word of Jehovah spoken through Joshua , the son of Nun .
Elijah the Tishbite , of Tishbe in Gilead , said to Ahab : » By the living Jehovah , the God of Israel , whose servant I am , there will be no dew or rain in these years , but only at my word . «
Then the word of Jehovah came to him , saying :
» Go east from here and hide by the Cherith Brook , east of Jordan .
» You will drink from the brook . I have ordered the ravens to feed you there . «
So he did as Jehovah said , living by the Cherith Brook , east of Jordan .
The ravens took him bread in the morning and meat in the evening . And he drank water from the brook .
Now after a time the brook became dry , because there was no rain in the land .
Then the word of Jehovah came to him , saying :
» Go now to Zarephath , in Zidon , and live there . I have given orders to a widow woman there to see that you have food . «
He went to Zarephath . When he came to the gate of the town , he saw a widow woman gathering sticks . He said to her : » Will you give me a little water in a vessel for my drink ? «
As she was going to get it , he said : » And get me some bread . «
Then she said : » By the life of Jehovah your God , I have nothing but a little meal , and a drop of oil in the bottle ; and now I am getting two sticks together so that I may go in and make it ready for me and my son , so that we may have a meal before our death . «
Elijah said to her : » Have no fear . Go and do as you said , but first make me a little cake of it and come and give it to me . Then make something for yourself and your son .
» For this is the word of Jehovah , the God of Israel : ‘ Your supply of meal will not come to an end . The bottle will never be without oil , till the day when Jehovah sends rain on the earth . ’ «
She did as Elijah told her and they all had food for a long time .
The store of meal did not come to an end . The bottle was never without oil . This was just as Jehovah said through the mouth of Elijah .
After this the son of the woman of the house became ill . He was so ill that there was no breath in him .
She said to Elijah : » What have I to do with you , O man of God ? Have you come to put God in mind of my sin , and to put my son to death ? «
He said : » Give your son to me . « And lifting him out of her arms , he took him up to his room and put him down on his bed .
Crying to Jehovah he said : » O Jehovah my God , have you sent evil even on the widow I now visit , by causing her son's death ? «
Stretching himself out on the child three times , he made his prayer to Jehovah . He said : » O Jehovah my God , be pleased to let this child's life come back to him again . «
Jehovah listened to the voice of Elijah . The child began to breath and came back to life .
Elijah took the child down from his room into the house and gave him to his mother . » See , your son is alive . « He said .
Then the woman said to Elijah : » Now I am certain that you are a man of God , and that the word of Jehovah in your mouth is truth . «
After a long time , the word of Jehovah came to Elijah . In the third year he said : » Go and let Ahab see you . I will send rain on the earth . «
So Elijah went to let Ahab see him . There was no food to be had in Samaria .
Ahab sent for Obadiah , the controller of the king's house . Obadiah had great respect for Jehovah .
When Jezebel massacred the prophets of Jehovah , Obadiah took a hundred of them , and hid them secretly in a hole in the rock , fifty at a time , and gave them bread and water .
Ahab said to Obadiah : » Come ! Let us go through all the country , to all the fountains of water and all the rivers . Let us see if there is any grass for the horses and the transport beasts . We must save some of the livestock . «
They went through all the country by dividing it between them . Ahab went in one direction by himself , and Obadiah went in another by himself .
While Obadiah was on his way , he came face to face with Elijah . Seeing who it was , he went down on his face and said : » Is it you , my lord Elijah ? «
Elijah answered : » It is I . Go tell your lord Elijah is here . «
He said : » What sin have I done that you are delivering your servant into the hand of Ahab to kill him ?
» By the life of Jehovah your God , there is not a nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent in search of you . When they said : He is not here ; he made them take an oath that they had not seen you .
» Now you say : ‘ Go , say to your lord Elijah is here . ’ «
» What if the Spirit of Jehovah carries you off to some unknown place as soon as I leave ? Then , when I tell Ahab that you are here and he cannot find you , he will put me to death . Remember that I have been a devout worshiper of Jehovah ever since I was a boy .
» Have you not heard that when Jezebel was killing Jehovah’s prophets I hid a hundred of them in caves , in two groups of fifty , and supplied them with food and water ?
» So how can you order me to go and tell the king that you are here ? He will kill me ! «
Elijah said : » By the life of Jehovah of armies , whose servant I am , I will certainly let him see me today . «
So Obadiah went to Ahab and gave him the news . Ahab went to see Elijah .
Ahab saw Elijah . He said : » Is it you , Israel’s troublemaker ? «
Then he said in answer : » I have not made trouble for Israel . You and your family have . You have disobeyed Jehovah’s commands and have gone after the Baals .
» Now gather all Israel together before me at Mount Carmel . Also gather the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal who get their food at Jezebel's table . «
So Ahab sent for all the children of Israel , and assembled the prophets together at Mount Carmel .
Elijah came near to all the people and said : » How long will you balance bounce back and forth between two opinions ? If Jehovah is God , then give worship to him . If Baal is , give worship to him . « The people did not answer him .
Then Elijah said to the people : » I , even I , am the only living prophet of Jehovah but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men . «
» Let them give us two bulls . Let them take one for themselves and have it cut up , and put it on the wood , but put no fire under it . I will get the other bull ready , and put it on the wood , and put no fire under it .
» You pray to your god and I will pray to Jehovah . The God who answers with fire is God ! « All the people answered : » It is well said . «
Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal : » Take one bull for yourselves and get it ready first , for there are so many of you ; and make your prayers to your god , but do not light the fire .
So they took the bull that was given them , and made it ready . They cried out to Baal from morning till the middle of the day . They said : » O Baal , give ear to us . « But there was no voice and no answer . They jumped up and down before the altar they had made .
In the middle of the day , Elijah made sport of them , saying : » Give louder cries , for he is a god ; he may be deep in thought . He may have gone away for some purpose . Perhaps he is on a journey . By chance he is sleeping and must be woke up . «
So they gave loud cries and they cut themselves with knives and swords till the blood came streaming out all over them .
They went on with their prayers from midday till the time of the offering ; but there was no voice , or any answer , or any who gave attention to them .
Then Elijah said to all the people : » Come near to me . « Then all the people came near . He repaired the altar of Jehovah that was broken down .
Elijah took twelve stones , the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob , to whom Jehovah said : » Israel will be your name . «
He used the stones to make an altar to the name of Jehovah . He dug a trench around the altar , large enough to hold two seahs of seed .
He put the wood in order and cut the bull in pieces and laid it on there . Then he said : Get four vessels full of water and put it on the burned offering and on the wood . Do it a second time , and they did it a second time .
Then he said : » Get four vessels full of water and put it on the burned offering and on the wood . Do it a second time « They did it a second time . Then he said : » Do it a third time « and they did it a third time .
The water went all round the altar until the drain was full .
Then at the time of the offering , Elijah the prophet came near and said , » Jehovah , the God of Abraham , of Isaac , and of Israel , let it be seen this day that you are God in Israel , and that I am your servant , and that I have done all these things by your order .
» Give me an answer , O Jehovah . Give me an answer so that this people may see that you are God . That you have made their hearts come back again . «
Then the fire of Jehovah came down . It burned up the offering and the wood and the stones and the dust , and drinking up the water in the drain .
When the people saw it , they all went down on their faces . They said : » Jehovah is God ! Jehovah is God ! «
Elijah said to them : » Take the prophets of Baal . Do not let one of them get away . « So they took them , and Elijah made them go down to the stream Kishon , and executed them there .
Then Elijah said to Ahab : » Get up and take food and drink , for there is a sound of much rain . «
So Ahab went up to have food and drink . Elijah went up to the top of Carmel . He bowed down to the earth and put his face between his knees .
He told his servant to look in the direction of the sea . After he looked the servant said : » There is nothing . « Elijah said : » Go again seven times . « So he went seven times .
The seventh time he said : » I see a cloud coming up out of the sea , as small as a man's hand . « Then Elijah said : » Go up and say to Ahab , Get your carriage ready and go down or the rain will keep you back . «
After a very little time , the heaven became black with clouds and wind , and there was a great rain . Ahab went in his carriage to Jezreel .
The hand of Jehovah was on Elijah . Jehovah gave special strength to Elijah and he ran ahead of Ahab until they came to Jezreel .
King Ahab told his wife Jezebel everything Elijah had done . He told how he put all the prophets of Baal to death .
She sent a message to Elijah : » May the gods strike me dead if by this time tomorrow I do not do the same thing to you that you did to the prophets . «
Elijah was afraid and fled for his life . He took his servant and went to Beersheba in Judah . He left the servant there .
Elijah walked a whole day into the wilderness . He stopped and sat down under a broom plant and wished he would die . » It is just too much , Jehovah , « he prayed . » Take away my life . I could just as well be dead . «
Stretching himself on the earth , he went to sleep under the broom-plant . An angel touched him and said : » Get up and eat some food . «
Looking up , he saw near his head a cake cooked on coals and a bottle of water . So he ate food and drink water and went to sleep again .
The angel of Jehovah came again a second time , and touched him and said : » Get up and have some food , or you will not have strength for the journey . «
So he got up and took food and drink . He was strengthened to go for forty days and forty nights , to Horeb , the mountain of God .
He went into a cave and spent the night . The word of Jehovah came to him , saying : » What are you doing here , Elijah ? «
He said : » I have been zealous for Jehovah , the God of hosts . The children of Israel have not kept your agreement covenant . They have destroyed your altars . They killed your prophets with the sword . I , even I , am the only one living . Now they seek to take my life too . «
Then he said : » Go out and take your place on the mountain before Jehovah . « Jehovah passed by and the force of a great wind parted the mountains . Rocks were broken before Jehovah but Jehovah was not in the wind . After the wind there was an earthquake , but Jehovah was not in the earthquake .
After the earthquake a fire , but Jehovah was not in the fire . And after the fire , the sounds of a soft breathe .
Elijah heard it and went out covering his face with his robe . He stood by the entrance of the cave . He heard a voice saying : » What are you doing here , Elijah ? «
He replied : » I have been very zealous for Jehovah , the God of hosts . The children of Israel have not kept your agreement . They have torn down your altars . They killed your prophets with the sword . I , even I , am the only one living . Now they seek to take my life . «
Jehovah said to him : » Go back on your way through the wasteland to Damascus . « When you get there , put holy oil on Hazael to make him king over Aram ,
» And also anoint Jehu , son of Nimshi , making him king over Israel ; and Elisha , the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah , to be prophet in your place .
» Whoever escapes the sword of Hazael , Jehu will put to death . Whoever escapes the sword of Jehu , Elisha will put to death .
» I will leave seven thousand people alive in Israel ; all those who are loyal to me and have not bowed to Baal or kissed his idol . «
Elijah left there and found Elisha plowing with a team of bulls . There were eleven teams ahead of him . He was plowing with the last one . Elijah took off his cloak and put it on Elisha .
Elisha then left his bulls and ran after Elijah . He said : » Let me kiss my father and mother good-bye and then I will go with you . « Elijah answered , » All right , go back . I am not stopping you ! «
Then Elisha went to his team of bulls , killed them , and cooked the meat . He used the yoke as fuel for the fire . He gave the meat to the people , and they ate it . Then he followed Elijah as his helper .
King Benhadad of Syria mustered his entire army , accompanied by thirty-two other kings with their horses and chariots , he laid siege on Samaria , and launched attacks against it .
He sent messengers into the city to King Ahab of Israel to say : » King Benhadad demands that
you surrender to him your silver and gold , your women and the strongest of your children . «
Tell my lord , King Benhadad , that I agree ; he can have everything I own , Ahab answered .
Later the messengers came back to Ahab with another demand from Benhadad : » I sent you word that you were to hand over to me your silver and gold , your women and your children . «
Now I will send my officers to search your palace and the homes of your officials . They will take everything they consider valuable . They will be there about this time tomorrow .
Then the king of Israel sent for all the responsible men of the land , and said : » Now will you take note and see the evil purpose of this man . He sent for my wives and my children , my silver and my gold , and I did not keep them back . «
All the responsible men and the people said to him : » Do not pay attention to him or do what he says . «
So he said to the representatives of Benhadad : » Say to my lord the king : ‘ All the orders you sent the first time I will do . But I will not do this thing . « The representatives went back with this answer .
Benhadad sent Ahab the following message : » May the gods strike me dead if there will be enough dust left from Samaria to give a handful to each soldier who follows me . «
The king of Israel responded : » It is said , let not the one who puts on his armor boast like the one who takes it off . «
Benhadad heard this when he and his allies were drinking in their tents . He told his officers to get ready . So they got prepared to attack the city .
A prophet approached King Ahab of Israel and said : » This is what Jehovah says : ‘ Have you seen this large army ? I will hand it over to you today . Then you will know that I am Jehovah . ’ «
Ahab asked : » How will this be done ? « The prophet answered : » This is what Jehovah says : ‘ By using the young officers of the district governors . « » Who will start the battle ? « Ahab asked . » You will , « the prophet answered .
Ahab mustered the young officers of the district governors . There were two hundred and thirty-two . After counting them , he counted all the Israelite soldiers . There were seven thousand .
In the middle of the day they went out . But Benhadad was drinking in the tents with the thirty-two kings who were helping him .
The servants of the chiefs who were over the divisions of the land went forward first . Benhadad sent out a patrol and they told him : » Men have come out from Samaria . «
He said : » If they have come out for peace , take them alive and if they have come out for war , take them alive . «
So the servants of the chiefs of the divisions of the land went out of the town , with the army following them .
Each one killed his opponent . The Syrians Aramaeans went in flight with Israel after them . Benhadad the king of Aram got away safely on a horse with his horsemen .
The king of Israel took the horses and the war-carriages and caused great destruction among the Syrians .
Then the prophet came up to the king of Israel , and said : » Now make yourself strong . Be careful what you do . Otherwise a year from now the king of Aram will come up against you again . «
Then the king of Aram's servants said to him : » Their god is a god of the hills . That is why they were stronger than us . If we attack them in the lowlands , we will certainly be stronger than they .
» This is what you must do : take the kings from their positions , and put captains in their places .
» Assemble another army like the one that was destroyed . Horse for horse , and carriage for carriage let us make war on them in the lowlands , and certainly we will be stronger than they . « He listened and did what was suggested .
So , a year later , Benhadad got the Syrians Aramaeans together and went to Aphek to make war on Israel .
And the children of Israel assembled , and food was made ready and they went against them . The children of Israel camped like two little flocks of goats before them . All the country was full of the Syrians .
A man of God came to the king of Israel . He said : » Jehovah says , ‘ Because the Aramaeans have said , » Jehovah is a god of the hills and not of the valleys ; I will give all this great army into your hands , and you will see that I am Jehovah . « ’ «
The two armies kept their positions facing one another for seven days . The seventh day the fight was started . The children of Israel put to the sword a hundred thousand Aramaean footmen in one day .
The rest went in flight to Aphek , into the town , where a wall came down on the twenty-seven thousand who were still living . Benhadad went in flight into the town , into an inner room .
His servants said to him : » It is said that the kings of Israel are full of mercy : let us then put on haircloth , and cords on our heads , and go to the king of Israel . Maybe he will give you your life . «
So they put on haircloth , and cords on their heads , and went to the king of Israel and said : » Your servant Benhadad says : ‘ Let me now keep my life . ’ « And he said : » Is he still living ? He is my brother . «
Now the men took it as a sign , and were quick to pick up on his word . They said : » Benhadad is your brother . « Then he said : » Go and get him . « So Ben-hadad came out to him and he made him get up into his carriage .
Benhadad said : » The towns my father took from your father I will give back . You may name streets for yourself in Damascus as my father did in Samaria . « As for me , at the price of this agreement you will let me go . So he made an agreement with him and let him go .
A man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbors by the word of Jehovah : » Give me a wound . « But the man would not .
Then he said : » Because you have not listened to the voice of Jehovah , immediately after you leave me a lion will kill you . « When he went away a lion came rushing at him and killed him .
Then he came across another man , and said : » Give me a wound . « And the man gave him a blow wounding him .
So the prophet went away , and pulling his headband over his eyes to keep his face covered . He took his place by the road waiting for the king .
When the king went by he cried out to him : » Your servant went out into the fight . A man came to me . He brought a man to me and said : ‘ guard this man . Do not let him get away . Your life is the price of his life or you will have to give a talent of silver in payment . ’
» But while your servant was turning this way and that , he was gone . Then the king of Israel said to him : ‘ You are responsible ; you have given the decision against yourself . ’ «
He quickly took the headband from his eyes . The king of Israel saw that he was one of the prophets .
He said to him : » These are the words of Jehovah : ‘ Because you have let go from your hands the man whom I had put to the curse , your life will be taken for his life , and your people for his people . ’ «
Then the king of Israel went back to his house , bitter and angry , he went to Samaria .
Naboth the Jezreelite had a garden in Jezreel , near the house of Ahab , king of Samaria .
Ahab said to Naboth : » Give me your garden so that I may have it for a garden of sweet plants . Since it is near my house let me give you a better vine-garden in exchange . If it seems good to you , let me give you its value in money . «
But Naboth said to Ahab , » God forbid that I give you the heritage of my fathers . «
Ahab returned to his house bitter and angry because Naboth the Jezreelite said to him : » I will not give you the heritage of my fathers . « Stretching himself on the bed with his face turned away , he would not eat .
Jezebel his wife came to him and asked : » Why is your spirit so bitter that you have no desire for food ? «
He replied : » I was talking to Naboth the Jezreelite . I said to him : ‘ Let me have your garden for money , or , if it pleases you , I will give you another garden for it . ’ ’ ‘ But he said : » I will not give you my garden . « ’ «
Then his wife Jezebel said : » Are you now the ruler of Israel ? Get up , eat and be happy . I will give you the garden of Naboth the Jezreelite . «
So she sent a letter in Ahab's name , stamped with his stamp , to the elders and nobles who were in authority with Naboth .
The letter she wrote is as follows : » Let a time of public sorrow be fixed , and put Naboth at the head of the people .
» Get two good-for-nothing persons to come before him and give witness that he has been cursing God and the king . Then take him out and have him stoned to death . «
So the elders and nobles in authority in his town did as Jezebel said in the letter she sent them .
They gave orders for a day of public sorrow and put Naboth at the head of the people .
The two good-for-nothing persons came in and took their seats before him and gave witness against Naboth , in front of the people . They said : » Naboth has been cursing God and the king . « Then they took him outside the town and had him stoned to death .
Then they sent word to Jezebel , saying : » Naboth has been stoned and is dead . «
Jezebel , hearing that Naboth had been stoned and was dead , said to Ahab : » Get up and take as your heritage the garden of Naboth the Jezreelite , which he would not give you for money . Naboth is dead . «
When he heard that Naboth was dead , Ahab went down to the garden of Naboth the Jezreelite to take it as his heritage .
And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite , saying :
» Go to Ahab , king of Israel , in Samaria . He is in the garden of Naboth the Jezreelite . He went there to take it as his heritage . «
» Say to him : ‘ Jehovah says : » Have you put a man to death and taken his heritage ? « ’ « » Then say : ‘ Jehovah says : » Your blood will become the drink of dogs ! You will go to the same place where the dogs drink the blood of Naboth . « ’ «
Ahab said to Elijah : » Have you come face to face with me , O my enemy ? « Elijah said : » I have come to you because you have given yourself up to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah . «
Jehovah says to you : » I will bring disaster on you . I will do away with you and get rid of every male in your family , young and old alike .
» Your family will become like the family of King Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the family of King Baasha son of Ahijah . This is because you have stirred up my anger by leading Israel into sin .
» Concerning Jezebel , Jehovah says : Dogs will eat her body in the city of Jezreel .
» Dogs will eat your relatives dying in the city . Vultures will eat your dead relatives in the country . «
No one else devoted himself so completely to doing wrong in Jehovah’s sight as Ahab all at the urging of his wife Jezebel .
He committed the most shameful sins by worshiping idols the way the Amorites had done . Jehovah drove the Amorites from the land as the people of Israel advanced .
Elijah finished speaking . Ahab tore his clothes and took them off . He dressed in sackcloth . He refused food fasted and slept in the sackcloth . He was gloomy and depressed .
Jehovah said to the prophet Elijah :
» Have you noticed how Ahab has humbled himself before me ? Since he has done this , I will not bring disaster on him during his lifetime . It will be during his son's lifetime that I will bring disaster on Ahab's family . «
There was peace between Israel and Syria for the next two years .
In the third year King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to see King Ahab of Israel .
Ahab asked his officials : » Why have we not done anything to get back Ramoth in Gilead from the king of Syria ? It is ours ! «
Ahab asked Jehoshaphat : » Will you go with me to attack Ramoth ? « » I am ready when you are , « Jehoshaphat answered . » And so are my soldiers and my cavalry . «
» First let us inquire of Jehovah . «
So Ahab called in the prophets , about four hundred of them , and asked them : » Should I attack Ramoth , or not ? « They answered : » Attack , Jehovah will give you victory . «
Jehoshaphat asked : » Is there another prophet through whom we can consult Jehovah ? «
Ahab answered : » There is one more , Micaiah son of Imlah . But I hate him because he never prophesies anything good for me , always something bad . « » The king should not say such things ! « Jehoshaphat replied .
Then Ahab called a court official and told him to get Micaiah at once .
They dressed in their royal robes and sat on their thrones at the threshing place near the gate of Samaria . The two kings listened to all the prophets prophesy in front of them .
One of them , Zedekiah son of Chenaanah , made iron horns and said to Ahab : » Jehovah says : ‘ With these you will fight the Syrians and totally defeat them . ’ «
All the other prophets said the same thing : » March against Ramoth and you will win , « they said . » Jehovah will give you victory . «
The messenger who went to get Micaiah said to him : » All the other prophets have prophesied success for the king . You had better do the same . «
Micaiah answered : » By the living God Jehovah I promise that I will say what he tells me to say ! «
He appeared before King Ahab . The king asked him : » Micaiah , should King Jehoshaphat and I go and attack Ramoth , or not ? « » Attack ! « Micaiah answered . » You will win . Jehovah will give you victory . «
But Ahab replied : » Tell the truth when you speak to me in the name of Jehovah ! How many times do I have to tell you that ? «
Micaiah answered : » I can see the army of Israel scattered over the hills like sheep without a shepherd . « Jehovah said : » These men have no leader . Let them go home in peace . «
Israel’s king said to Jehoshaphat : » Did I not say to you , He will prophesy about me ? It is always something bad ! «
Micaiah continued : » Now listen to what Jehovah says ! I saw Jehovah sitting on his throne in heaven , with all his angels standing beside him . «
Jehovah asked : » Who will deceive Ahab so that he will go and be killed at Ramoth ? Some of the angels said one thing , and others said something else ,
until a spirit stepped forward , approached Jehovah , « and said : » I will deceive him . «
» How will you deceive him ? « Jehovah asked . The spirit replied : » I will make all of Ahab's prophets tell lies . « Jehovah said : » Go and deceive him . You will succeed . «
Micaiah concluded : This is what has happened . Jehovah made these prophets of yours lie to you . He has decreed that you will meet with disaster !
The prophet Zedekiah went to Micaiah and slapped his face . He asked : » Since when did Jehovah’s spirit leave me and speak to you ? «
» You will see when you go into an inner chamber to hide . « Micaiah replied .
The king of Israel said : » Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon , the ruler of the town , and to Joash , the king's son .
» ‘ Tell them : ‘ It is the king's order that this man is to be put in prison and given prison food till I come again in peace . ’ «
Micaiah said : If you come back at all in peace , Jehovah has not sent his word by me .
So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat , the king of Judah , went to Ramoth-gilead .
The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat : » I will change my clothing , so that I do not seem to be the king . Then I will go into the fight . You put on your royal robes . So the king of Israel changed his dress and went into the battle . «
Now the king of Aram had given orders to the thirty-two captains of his war-carriages , saying : » Make no attack on small or great , but only on the king of Israel . «
So when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , they said : » Truly , this is the king of Israel . « They turned against him and surrounded him . Jehoshaphat gave a cry .
When the captains of the chariots saw that he was not the king of Israel they withdrew from him .
A stray arrow wounded the king of Israel a wound where his breastplate was joined to his clothing . He said to the chariot driver : » Go to the side . Take me away from the fight for I am badly wounded . «
The fight grew more violent as the day went on . The king was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians Aramaeans . The floor of the chariot was covered with the blood from his wound . By evening he died .
About sundown a cry went up from all parts of the army , saying : » Let every man go back to his town and his country , for the king is dead . «
They traveled to Samaria and buried the king there .
The chariot was washed at the pool of Samaria the bathing-place of the loose women . Dogs were drinking his blood there , as Jehovah said .
Everything else that King Ahab did , including an account of his palace decorated with ivory and of all the cities he built , is recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel .
Ahab’s son Ahaziah succeeded him as king .
Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king of Judah in the fourth year of the reign of King Ahab of Israel .
He was thirty-five years old . He ruled in Jerusalem for twenty-five years . His mother was Azubah , the daughter of Shilhi .
Like his father Asa before him , he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah . However the places of worship were not destroyed , and the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there .

Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel .
Everything else that Jehoshaphat did , all his bravery and his battles , are recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah .
He banished all the male and female prostitutes serving at the pagan altars who were still left from the days of his father Asa .
The land of Edom had no king . A deputy appointed by the king of Judah ruled it .
King Jehoshaphat had ocean-going ships built to sail to the land of Ophir for gold . They were wrecked at Eziongeber and never sailed .
King Ahaziah of Israel offered to let his men sail with Jehoshaphat's men . Jehoshaphat refused the offer .
Jehoshaphat died and was buried in the royal tombs in David's City . His son Jehoram succeeded him as king .
Ahaziah son of Ahab became king of Israel . It was the seventeenth year of the reign of King Jehoshaphat of Judah . Ahaziah ruled in Samaria for two years .
He sinned against Jehovah , following the wicked example of his father Ahab , his mother Jezebel , and King Jeroboam , who had led Israel into sin .
He worshiped and served Baal . Like his father before him , he aroused the anger of Jehovah , the God of Israel .
The country of Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of King Ahab of Israel .
King Ahaziah of Israel fell off the balcony on the roof of his palace in Samaria and was seriously injured . He sent some messengers and said to them : » Go to consult Baalzebub , the god of the Philistine city of Ekron , to find out whether or not I will recover from this . «
Jehovah’s angel commanded Elijah , the prophet from Tishbe , » Go and meet the messengers of King Ahaziah . Ask them : ‘ Why are you going to consult Baalzebub , the god of Ekron ? Do you think there is no god in Israel ? ’
» ‘ Tell the king Jehovah says : ‘ You will not recover from your injuries . You will in fact die ! ’ « Elijah did as Jehovah commanded .
The messengers returned to the king . » Why have you come back ? « He asked .
They answered : » A man told us to come back and tell you that Jehovah says : ‘ Why are you sending messengers to consult Baalzebub , the god of Ekron ? Is it because you think there is no god in Israel ? You will not recover from your injuries . You will die ! ’ «
» What did the man look like ? « The king asked .
» He was a hairy man wearing a cloak made of animal skins , tied with a leather belt , « they answered . » It is Elijah ! « The king exclaimed .
Then he sent an officer with fifty men to get Elijah . The officer found him sitting on a hill and said to him : » Man of God , the king orders you to come down . «
» If I am a man of God , « Elijah answered : » Let fire come down from heaven and kill you and your men ! « At once fire came down and killed the officer and his men .
The king sent another officer with fifty men , who went up and said to Elijah : » Man of God , the king orders you to come down at once ! «
» Since I am a man of God , « Elijah answered : » let fire come down from heaven and kill you and your men ! « At once the fire of God came down and killed the officer and his men .
Once more the king sent an officer with fifty men . He went up the hill , fell on his knees in front of Elijah , and pleaded : » Man of God , be merciful to my men and me . Spare our lives !
» The other officers and their men were killed by fire from heaven . Please , please be merciful to me ! «
The angel of Jehovah said to Elijah : » Go down with him . Do not be afraid of him . « So Elijah went with the officer to the king .
Elijah spoke to the king : » This is what Jehovah says : ‘ Because you sent messengers to consult Baalzebub , the god of Ekron acting as if there were no god in Israel to consult , you will not get well . You will die ! «
Ahaziah died , just as Jehovah spoke through Elijah . Ahaziah had no sons , so his brother Joram succeeded him as king . This happened in the second year of the reign of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat , king of Judah .
Everything else that King Ahaziah did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel .
The time came for Jehovah to take Elijah up into the physical heavens the sky in a whirlwind . Elijah and Elisha set out from Gilgal ,
and on the way Elijah said to Elisha : » Stay here for Jehovah has ordered me to go to Bethel . « But Elisha answered : » I swear by my loyalty to the living God Jehovah and to you that I will not leave you . « So they went on to Bethel .
A group of prophets who lived at Bethel asked Elisha : » Do you know that Jehovah is going to take your master away from you today ? « » Yes , I know , « Elisha answered . » But let us not talk about it . «
Then Elijah said to Elisha : » Stay here for Jehovah has ordered me to go to Jericho . « But Elisha answered : » I swear by my loyalty to the living God Jehovah and to you that I will not leave you . « So the two of them went on to Jericho .
A group of prophets who lived at Jericho went to Elisha and asked him : » Do you know that Jehovah is going to take your master away from you today ? « » Yes , I know , « Elisha answered . » But let us not talk about it . «
Then Elijah said to Elisha : » Stay here for Jehovah has ordered me to go to the Jordan River . « But Elisha answered : » I swear by my loyalty to the living God Jehovah and to you that I will not leave you . « So they went on ,
and fifty of the prophets followed them to the Jordan . Elijah and Elisha stopped by the river . The fifty prophets stood a short distance away .
Then Elijah took off his cloak . He rolled it up and struck the water with it . The water divided , and he and Elisha crossed to the other side on dry ground .
Elijah said to Elisha : » Tell me what you want me to do for you before I am taken from you . « Elisha answered : » Let me receive a double share of your spirit power . «
» That is a difficult request to grant , « Elijah replied . » But you will receive it if you see me as I am being taken away from you . If you do not see me , you will not receive it . «
They kept talking as they walked . Then suddenly a chariot of fire pulled by horses of fire came between them . Elijah was taken up into the physical heaven the sky by a whirlwind .
Elisha saw it and cried out to Elijah : » My father , my father ! Mighty defender of Israel ! You are gone ! « He never saw Elijah again . In grief Elisha tore his cloak in two .
He picked up Elijah's cloak that had fallen from him . He returned to stand by the bank of the Jordan .
Elisha struck the water with Elijah's cloak and said : » Where is Jehovah , the God of Elijah ? « Then he struck the water again , and it divided , and he walked over to the other side .
The fifty prophets from Jericho saw him and said : » The power of Elijah is on Elisha ! « So they went to meet him and bowed down before him .
They said : » There are fifty of us here . We are all strong men . Let us go and look for your master . Maybe the Spirit of Jehovah has carried him away and left him on some mountain or in some valley . « Elisha answered : » You must not go . «
They insisted until he gave in and let them go . The fifty of them went and looked high and low for Elijah for three days . But they did not find him .
Then they returned to Elisha . He waited at Jericho . He said to them : » Did I tell you not to go ? «
Men from Jericho went to Elisha and said : » You may know that this is a fine city but the water is bad and causes miscarriages . «
He ordered them : » Put some salt in a new bowl and bring it to me . « They brought it to him ,
and he went to the spring , threw the salt in the water , and said : » This is what Jehovah says : ‘ I make this water pure . It will not cause any more deaths or miscarriages . ’ «
That water has been pure ever since , just as Elisha said it would be .
Elisha left Jericho to go to Bethel . On the way some boys came out of a town and taunted and made fun of him . They shouted : » Get out of here , baldy ! «
Elisha turned around and glared at them . He cursed them in the name of Jehovah . Then two she-bears came out of the woods and tore forty-two of the boys to pieces .
Elisha traveled to Mount Carmel and later returned to Samaria .
Joram son of Ahab became king of Israel in the eighteenth year of the reign of King Jehoshaphat of Judah . He ruled in Samaria for twelve years .
Though he was not as bad as his father or his mother Jezebel ; he sinned against Jehovah . He removed the image his father had made for the worship of Baal .
Like King Jeroboam son of Nebat before him , he caused Israel to sin . He would not turn away from sin .
King Mesha of Moab raised sheep . Yearly he gave as tribute to the king of Israel one hundred thousand lambs and the wool from one hundred thousand sheep .
When King Ahab of Israel died Mesha rebelled against Israel .
At once King Joram mobilized his troops and left Samaria .
He sent this message to King Jehoshaphat of Judah : » The king of Moab rebelled against me . Will you join me to war against Moab ? « King Jehoshaphat replied : » I will . I am on your side . My men and horses are at your disposal .
» Which way shall we go to the attack ? « Joram answered : » We will go the long way through the wilderness of Edom . «
King Joram and the kings of Judah and Edom assembled . After marching seven days , they ran out of water . There was none left for the men or the pack animals .
» Alas , all is done , « King Joram exclaimed . » Has Jehovah called us together to be at the mercy of the king of Moab ? «
King Jehoshaphat asked : » Do we have a prophet here to consult Jehovah ? « An officer of King Joram's forces answered : » Elisha son of Shaphat is here who used to pour water on the hands of Elijah . «
» The word of Jehovah is with him , « King Jehoshaphat said . So the three kings went to Elisha .
» Why should I have anything to do with you ? « Elisha said to the king of Israel . » Go consult the prophets your father and mother consulted . « » No ! « Joram king of Israel replied . » It is Jehovah who placed us three kings at the mercy of the king of Moab . «
Elisha answered : » By the living God Jehovah , whom I serve , I swear that I would have nothing to do with you if I did not respect your ally , King Jehoshaphat of Judah .
» Now bring me a musician . As the musician played his harp , the power of Jehovah came on Elisha . «
He said : » This is what Jehovah says : ‘ Dig ditches all over this dry streambed wadi .
» You will not see any rain or wind . This streambed will be filled with water and you and your animals will have plenty to drink . «
Elisha continued : » This is an easy thing for Jehovah to do . He will also give you victory over the Moabites .
» You will conquer all their beautiful fortified cities . You will cut down all their fruit trees , stop all their springs , and ruin all their fertile fields by covering them with stones . «
The next morning when the sacrifice was offered water came flowing from the direction of Edom . It covered the ground .
The Moabites heard that the three kings came to attack them . All the young and old men who could bear arms were called out and stationed at the border .
They got up the next morning . The sun was shining on the water . It looked as red as blood .
They said : » It is blood ! The three armies fought and killed each other ! Let us go and loot their camp ! «
When they came to the camp the Israelites attacked them and drove them back . The Israelites kept up the pursuit , killing the Moabites .
They destroyed their cities . As they passed by a fertile field , every Israelite would throw a stone on it until finally all the fields were covered with stones . They also stopped up the springs and cut down the fruit trees . At last only the capital city of Kir Heres was left . The slingers surrounded it and attacked it .
The king of Moab realized that he was losing the battle . So he took seven hundred swordsmen with him and tried to force his way through the enemy lines and escape to the king of Edom . However they failed .
He took his oldest son , who was to succeed him as king , and offered him on the city wall as a sacrifice to the god of Moab . The Israelites were terrified and so they drew back from the city and returned to their own country .
The widow of a member of a group of prophets said to Elisha : » My husband has died ! As you know , he was a man who respected God . A man to whom he owed money came to take away my two sons as slaves in payment for my husband's debt . «
Elisha said : » Tell me what shall I do for you ? What do you have at home ? « She answered : » Except for a small jar of olive oil , I have nothing . «
» Ask your neighbors for empty jars . Borrow as many as you can , « Elisha told her .
» You and your sons go into the house and shut the door behind you . Pour oil into the jars . Set each one aside as soon as it is full . «
The woman went into her house with her sons . They closed the door and took the small jar of olive oil , and poured oil into the jars as her sons brought them to her .
When the jars were full she asked if there were any more . » That was the last one , « one of her sons told her . So the olive oil stopped flowing .
She returned to Elisha , the prophet . He said : » Sell the olive oil and pay all your debts . There will be enough money left over for you and your sons to pay your living expenses . «
Elisha went to Shunem , where a rich woman lived . She invited him to a meal . From that time on every time he went to Shunem he would have his meals at her house .
She said to her husband : » I know that this man who comes here often is a holy man .
» Let us build a small room on the roof , and put a bed , a table , a chair , and a lamp in it . He can stay there when he visits us . «
One day Elisha returned to Shunem and went to his room to rest .
He told his servant Gehazi to call the woman . When she came ,
he said to Gehazi : » Ask her what I can do for her in return for all the trouble she has had in providing for our needs . Maybe she would like me to go to the king or the army commander and put in a good word for her . « » I have all I need here among my own people , « she answered .
Elisha asked Gehazi : » What can I do for her ? « He answered : » She has no son , and her husband is an old man . «
» Tell her to come here , « Elisha ordered . She came and stood in the doorway .
Elisha said to her : » By this time next year you will hold a son in your arms . « » Please do not lie to me . You are a man of God ! « She said .
Just as Elisha said , about that time the following year she gave birth to a son .
Years later at harvest time , the boy went out one morning to join his father , who was in the field with the harvest workers .
Suddenly he cried out to his father : » My head hurts ! My head hurts ! « » Carry the boy to his mother , « the father said to a servant .
The servant carried the boy back to his mother . She held him in her lap until noon . Then the boy died .
She carried him up to Elisha's room and put him on the bed . She closed the door behind her and left .
She called her husband and said to him : » Send a servant here with a donkey . I need to go to the prophet Elisha . I will be back as soon as I can . «
» Why must you go today ? « Her husband asked . » It is neither a Sabbath nor a New Moon Festival . « She replied : » Never mind . «
She had the donkey saddled , and ordered the servant : » Make the donkey go as fast as it can . Do not slow down unless I tell you . «
She left for Mount Carmel , where Elisha was . Elisha saw her coming while she was still far off . He said to his servant Gehazi : » Look , there comes the woman from Shunem !
» Hurry to her and find out if everything is all right with her and her family . « She told Gehazi that everything was all right ,
but when she came to Elisha , she bowed down before him and took hold of his feet . Gehazi was about to push her away . Elisha said : » Do not bother her . You can see she is deeply distressed . Jehovah has not told me a thing about it . «
The woman said to him : » Did I ask you for a son ? Did I not tell you not to get my hopes up ? «
Elisha told Gehazi : « Hurry ! Take my walking stick . Do not stop to talk to anyone . If anyone speaks to you do not respond . Go straight to the house and hold my stick over the boy . «
The woman said to Elisha : « I swear by my loyalty to the living God Jehovah and to you that I will not leave you ! So the two of them started back together . »
Gehazi went ahead and held Elisha's stick over the child . There was no sound or any other sign of life . He returned to meet Elisha and said : » The boy did not wake up . «
When Elisha arrived he went alone into the room . He saw the boy lying dead on the bed .
He closed the door and prayed to Jehovah .
Then he lay down on the boy , placing his mouth , eyes , and hands on the boy's mouth , eyes , and hands . As he lay stretched out over the boy , the boy's body started to get warm .
Elisha got up and walked around the room . He returned and again stretched himself over the boy . The boy sneezed seven times and then opened his eyes .
Elisha called Gehazi and told him to call the boy's mother . When she came in , he said to her : » Take your son ! «
She fell at Elisha's feet with her face on the ground . Then she took her son and left .
When there was a famine throughout the land , Elisha returned to Gilgal . He was teaching a group of prophets . He told his servant to put a big pot on the fire and make some stew for them .
One of them went out in the fields to gather herbs . He found a wild vine and picked as many gourds as he could carry . He brought them back and sliced them into the stew , not knowing what they were .
The stew was poured out for the men to eat . They tasted it and exclaimed to Elisha : » It is poisoned ! « They would not eat it .
Elisha asked for some meal . He threw it into the pot and said : » Pour out some more stew for them . « Then there was nothing wrong with it .
A man came from Baal Shalishah . He brought Elisha twenty loaves of bread made from the first barley harvested that year and some freshly cut heads of grain . Elisha told his servant to feed the group of prophets with this .
He asked : » How am I to feed a hundred hungry men with this ? « Elisha replied : » Give it to them to eat , because Jehovah says that they will eat and still have some left over . «
So the servant set the food before them . Just as Jehovah said , they ate and had some left over .
Naaman was a great soldier . He was commander of the Syrian army and highly respected and esteemed by the king of Syria Aram . Jehovah gave victory to the Syrian forces through Naaman . He suffered from a dreaded skin disease .
The Syrians carried off a little Israelite girl during one of their raids against Israel . The girl became a servant of Naaman's wife .
She said to her mistress : » I wish my master could go to the prophet who lives in Samaria ! He would cure him of his leprosy . «
Naaman heard of this and told the king what the girl said .
The king said : » Go to the king of Israel and take this letter to him . « Naaman departed . He took thirty thousand pieces of silver , six thousand pieces of gold , and ten changes of fine clothes .
The letter stated : » This letter will introduce my officer Naaman . I want you to cure him of his leprosy . «
The king of Israel read the letter and tore his clothes and said : » How can the king of Syria expect me to cure this man ? Does he think that I am God , with the power of life and death ? It is plain that he is trying to start a quarrel with me ! «
When the prophet Elisha heard what happened , he sent word to the king : » Why are you so upset ? Send Naaman to me . I will show him that there is a prophet in Israel ! «
Naaman went with his horses and chariots and stopped at the entrance to Elisha's house .
Elisha sent a servant to tell him to wash himself seven times in the Jordan River . He would then be completely cured of his disease .
Naaman left in a rage , saying : » I thought he would at least come out to me , pray to Jehovah his God , wave his hand over the diseased spot , and cure me !
» Are not the Abanah and Pharpar rivers in Damascus better than any river in Israel ? I could have washed in them and been cured ! «
His servants went up to him and said : » If the prophet had told you to do something difficult , you would have done it . Now why can you not just wash yourself , as he said , and be cured ? «
So Naaman went to the Jordan River and dipped himself in it seven times , as Elisha had instructed . He was completely cured . His flesh became firm and healthy like that of a child .
Naaman returned to Elisha with all his men and said : » Now I realize there is no god but the God of Israel . Please accept a gift from me . «
Elisha the prophet answered : » By the living God Jehovah whom I serve , I swear that I will not accept a gift . « Naaman insisted that he accept it , but he would not .
So Naaman said : » If you will not accept my gift , then let me have two mule-loads of earth to take home with me . From now on I will not offer sacrifices or burnt offerings to any god except Jehovah .
» I hope Jehovah will forgive me when I accompany my king to the temple of Rimmon , the god of Syria , and worship him . Surely Jehovah will forgive me ! «
Elisha said : » Go in peace . « And Naaman left . He had gone only a short distance ,
when Elisha's servant Gehazi said to himself : » My master has let Naaman get away without paying a thing ! He should have accepted what that Syrian offered him . By the living God Jehovah I will run after him and get something from him . «
He ran after Naaman . When Naaman saw a man running after him , he got down from his chariot to meet him , and asked : » What is wrong ? «
» Nothing is wrong , « answered Gehazi . » But my master sent me to tell you that just now two members of the group of prophets in the hill country of Ephraim arrived . He would like you to give them three thousand pieces of silver and two changes of fine clothes . «
» Please take six thousand pieces of silver , « Naaman replied . He tied the silver in two bags and gave them and two changes of fine clothes to two of his servants , and sent them on ahead of Gehazi .
They reached the hill where Elisha lived . Gehazi took the two bags and carried them into the house . Then he sent Naaman's servants back .
He went into the house . Elisha asked him : » Where have you been ? « » Oh , nowhere , « he answered .
Elisha said : » Was I there in spirit when the man got out of his chariot to meet you ? This is no time to accept money and clothes , olive groves and vineyards , sheep and cattle , or servants !
» Naaman's leprosy will come upon you . You and your descendants will have it from generation to generation ! « When Gehazi left , he had the disease . His skin was as white as snow .
The group of prophets Elisha was in charge of complained to him : » The place where we live is too small !
» Allow us to go to the Jordan and cut down some trees . We can build a place to live . « Elisha answered : » Go . «
One of them urged him to go with them and he agreed .
They set out together and when they arrived at the Jordan they cut down trees .
One of them was cutting down a tree when suddenly his ax head fell in the water . It was a borrowed ax , he exclaimed to Elisha . » What will I do ? «
Elisha said : » Where did it fall ? « The man showed him the place . Elisha cut off a stick . Then he threw it in the water and made the ax head float .
» Pick it up , « he ordered . The man put his hand in the water and picked it up .
The king of Syria was at war with Israel . He consulted his officers and chose a place to set up camp .
Elisha sent word to the king of Israel . He warned him not to go near that place , because the Syrians were waiting to ambush him .
The king of Israel warned the people who lived there . So they were on guard . This happened several times .
The Syrian king was greatly upset over this . He called in his officers and asked them : » Show me who of us is on the side of the king of Israel ? «
One of his servants said : » No one is , Your Majesty . The prophet Elisha tells the king of Israel what you say even in the privacy of your own bedroom . «
» Locate him ! « the king ordered , » and I will capture him . He was told : » Elisha is in Dothan . «
He sent a large force there with horses and chariots . They surrounded the town at night .
Early the next morning Elisha's servant got up and went out of the house . He saw the Syrian troops with their horses and chariots surrounding the town . He went to Elisha and said : » Alas my master what shall we do ? «
» Do not be afraid , « Elisha answered . » We have more on our side than they have on theirs . «
Elisha prayed : » O Jehovah , open his eyes that he may see . « Jehovah answered his prayer . Elisha's servant looked up and saw the hillside covered with horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha .
The Syrians attacked ! Elisha prayed , » O Jehovah , strike these men blind ! « Jehovah answered his prayer and struck them blind .
Elisha said to the Syrians : » This is not the way or the town you are looking for . Follow me , and I will lead you to the man you are after . « He led them to Samaria .
When they entered the city , Elisha prayed : » Open their eyes and let them see . « Jehovah answered his prayer . He restored their sight , and they saw that they were inside Samaria .
When the king of Israel saw the Syrians , he asked Elisha : » Shall I kill them ? «
» No , « Elisha answered . » Would you put to death soldiers you captured in combat ? Give them something to eat and drink . Then let them return to their king . «
So the king of Israel provided a great feast for them . After they ate and drank he sent them back to the king of Syria . From then on the Syrians stopped raiding the land of Israel .
After that King Benhadad of Syria led his entire army against Israel in siege of the city of Samaria .
The siege caused a great food shortage in the city . It was so severe that a donkey's head cost eighty pieces of silver , and half a pound of dove's dung cost five pieces of silver .
The king of Israel walked by on the city wall when a woman cried out : » Help me , Your Majesty ! «
The king replied : » If Jehovah will not help you , what help can I provide ? Where can I get you help from the threshing floor or the wine press ? «
The king asked : » What is your trouble ? « She answered : » The other day a woman suggested that we eat my child . Then we could eat her child the next day .
» So we cooked my son and ate him . The next day I told her that we would eat her son , but she had hidden him ! «
Hearing this , the king tore his clothes . The people close to the wall could see that he was wearing sackcloth under his clothes .
He exclaimed : » May God strike me dead if Elisha is not beheaded before the day is over ! «
He sent a messenger to get Elisha . Meanwhile Elisha was at home with some elders who were visiting him . Before the messenger arrived , Elisha said to the elders : » That murderer is sending someone to kill me ! When he gets here , shut the door . Do not let him come in . The king will follow him . «
While Elisha was still talking the king arrived and said : » Jehovah brought this trouble on us ! Why should I wait any longer for him to do something ? «
Elisha answered : » Hear the word of Jehovah : ‘ By this time tomorrow you will be able to buy in Samaria ten pounds of the best wheat or twenty pounds of barley for one piece of silver . ’ «
The personal attendant of the king said to Elisha : » If Jehovah could make floodgates in the heavens could this happen ? « Elisha replied : » You will see it with your own eyes . But you will not eat from it . «
Four men who were suffering from a dreaded skin disease were outside the gates of Samaria . They said to each other : » Why should we wait here until we die ?
» If we go into the city we will starve to death . If we stay here we will also die . So let us go to the Syrian camp . The worst they can do is kill us . Maybe they will spare our lives . «
They arose in the twilight and went to the Syrian camp . When they reached it , no one was there .
Jehovah made the Syrians hear what sounded like the advance of a large army with horses and chariots . The Syrians thought that the king of Israel had hired Hittite and Egyptian kings and their armies to attack them .
The Syrians arose and fled while it was yet dark . They left their tents , and their horses , and their donkeys in the camp and fled for their lives .
The lepers came to the edge of the camp . They went into one tent and ate and drank . They took silver and gold and clothing . They entered another tent and carried away spoil and hid it .
They said to each other : » We should not do this ! We have good news . We should not keep it to ourselves . If we wait until morning to tell it we will be punished . Let us go tell the king's officers ! «
They left the Syrian camp and went to Samaria . They called out to the guards at the gates : » We went to the Syrian camp and did not see or hear anyone . The horses and donkeys have not been untied . The tents are just as the Syrians left them . «
The guards announced the news . It was reported in the palace .
The king got out of bed even though it was night . He said to his officials : » I will tell you what the Syrians are planning ! They know about the famine here , so they have left their camp to go and hide in the countryside . They think that we will leave the city to find food . Then they will take us alive and capture the city . «
One of his servants said : » The people in the city are doomed like those who have already died . Send some men with five of the horses that are left and find out what happened . «
They chose some men and the king sent them in two chariots with instructions to go and find out what had happened to the Syrian army .
The men went to the Jordan . Along the road they saw the clothes and equipment that the Syrians had abandoned as they fled . Then they returned and reported to the king .
The people of Samaria rushed out and looted the Syrian camp . Just as Jehovah said , ten pounds of the best wheat or twenty pounds of barley were sold for one piece of silver .
The king of Israel put the city gate under the command of the officer who was his personal attendant . The officer was trampled to death there by the people and died , as Elisha had predicted when the king went to see him .
Elisha told the king that by that time the following day ten pounds of the best wheat or twenty pounds of barley would be sold in Samaria for one piece of silver .
The king’s attendant answered : » If Jehovah could open floodgates in the heavens could this happen ? « Elisha had replied : » You shall see with your own eyes . But you will not eat from it . «
And that is just what happened ! He died . The people at the city gate trampled him to death .
Elisha told the woman who lived in Shunem , whose son he brought back to life : » Jehovah is sending a famine on the land . It will last for seven years . Leave with your family and go live somewhere else . «
She followed his instructions and left with her family to live in Philistia for the seven years .
When the seven years ended she returned to Israel . She went to the king to ask that her house and her land be restored to her .
The king was talking with Gehazi , Elisha's servant , when she found him . The king wanted to know about Elisha's miracles .
Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had brought a dead person back to life . The woman made her appeal to the king . Gehazi said to him : » Your Majesty , here is the woman and here is her son whom Elisha brought back to life ! «
She responded to the king’s question by confirming Gehazi’s story . The king called an official and told him to give back to her everything that was hers . This included the value of all the crops that her fields produced during the seven years she was away .
Elisha went to Damascus when King Benhadad of Syria was sick . The king was told that Elisha was there .
He said to Hazael , one of his officials : » Take a gift to the prophet and ask him to consult Jehovah to find out whether or not I am going to get well . «
Hazael loaded forty camels with all kinds of the finest products of Damascus and went to Elisha . Hazael said : » Your servant , King Benhadad sent me to ask if he will recover from his sickness . «
Elisha answered : » Jehovah has revealed to me that he will die . However go to him and tell him that he will recover . «
Elisha stared at him in horror until Hazael became ill at ease . Suddenly Elisha burst into tears .
» Why are you crying ? « Hazael asked . » Because I know the horrible things you will do against the people of Israel , « Elisha answered . » You will burn their fortresses , slaughter their finest young men , batter their children to death , and rip open their pregnant women . «
» How could I ever be that powerful ? « Hazael asked . » I am nobody , only a dog . « Elisha replied : » Jehovah has revealed to me that you will be king of Syria . «
Hazael returned to Benhadad , who asked him : » What did Elisha say ? « » He told me that you will certainly get well , « Hazael answered .
The following day Hazael took a blanket , soaked it in water , and smothered the king . Hazael succeeded Benhadad as king of Syria .
Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat became king of Judah . It was the fifth year of the reign of Joram son of Ahab as king of Israel .
He was thirty-two years old . He ruled in Jerusalem for eight years .
His wife was Ahab's daughter . Like the family of Ahab he followed the evil ways of the kings of Israel . He sinned against Jehovah .
Jehovah was not willing to destroy Judah . He promised his servant David that his descendants would always continue to rule .
Edom revolted against Judah and became an independent kingdom .
Jehoram and his chariots went to Zair . The Edomite army surrounded them . He and his chariot commanders managed to break out and escape . His soldiers scattered to their homes .
Edom has been independent of Judah ever since . The city of Libnah also revolted at that time .
Everything Jehoram did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah .
Jehoram died and was buried in the royal tombs in David's City . His son Ahaziah succeeded him as king .
Ahaziah son of Jehoram became king of Judah . This was in the twelfth year of the reign of Joram son of Ahab as king of Israel .
He was twenty-two years old . He ruled in Jerusalem for one year . His mother was Athaliah , the daughter of King Ahab and granddaughter of King Omri of Israel .
Ahaziah was related to King Ahab by marriage . He sinned against Jehovah as Ahab's family did .
King Ahaziah joined King Joram of Israel in a war against King Hazael of Syria . The armies clashed at Ramoth in Gilead . Joram was wounded in battle .
He returned to the city of Jezreel to recover from his wounds . Ahaziah went there to visit him .
Elisha the prophet called one of the young prophets and said to him : » Prepare to go to Ramoth in Gilead . Take this jar of olive oil with you .
» When you get there look for Jehu , the son of Jehoshaphat and grandson of Nimshi . Take him to a private room away from his companions .
» Pour this olive oil on his head , and say : ‘ Jehovah anoints you king of Israel . Then leave there as fast as you can . ’ «
The young prophet went to Ramoth .
He found the army officers in conference . He said : » I have a message for you . « Jehu asked : » Who are you speaking to ? « » To you , captain . « He replied .
The two of them went indoors . The prophet poured the olive oil on Jehu's head and said to him : » Jehovah , the God of Israel , says : ‘ I anoint you king of my people Israel .
» ‘ You are to kill your master the king of the house of Ahab . I am punishing Jezebel for murdering my prophets and my other servants .
» ‘ The entire house of Ahab will perish . I will get rid of every male in his family , young and old alike .
» ‘ I will treat his family as I did the families of King Jeroboam son of Nebat and of King Baasha son of Ahijah .
» ‘ Jezebel will not be buried . Dogs in the territory of Jezreel will eat her body . ’ « After saying this , the young prophet opened the door and fled .
Jehu went back to his fellow officers . They asked him : » Is everything all right ? What did this mad fellow want with you ? « Jehu answered : » You know what he wanted . «
» No we do not ! « They replied . » Tell us what he said ! « They asked . » He told me that Jehovah says : ‘ I anoint you king of Israel . ’ «
At once Jehu's fellow officers spread their cloaks at the top of the steps for Jehu to stand on . They blew trumpets and shouted : » Jehu is king ! «
So Jehu , the son of Jehoshaphat , the son of Nimshi , plotted against Joram . Joram and all the army of Israel were keeping watch on Ramoth-gilead against Hazael , king of Aram :
King Joram went back to Jezreel to recuperate from the wounds he received from the Aramaeans when he fought against Hazael , king of Aram . Jehu said : » If this is your purpose let no one get away to give news of it in Jezreel . «
So Jehu got into his carriage and went to Jezreel . Joram was ill in bed there and Ahaziah , king of Judah came to see him .
The watchman on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu and his company coming . He said : » I see a company of people . « Joram said : » Send out a horseman to them and let him ask : ‘ Do you come in peace ? ’ «
So a horseman went out to them and said : » The king asks : ‘ Do you come in peace ? ‘ « Jehu said : » What have you to do with peace ? Follow me . « The watchman reported that the horseman reached the group and was returning .
A second man was sent out on horseback . He approached them and asked the same thing : » Do you come in peace ? « Jehu replied : » What have you to do with peace ? Follow me . «
The watchman reported : » He went up to them and has not come back . The driving is like the driving of Jehu , son of Nimshi , for he is driving violently . «
Joram said : » Get ready . « They prepared his chariot and Joram , king of Israel , with Ahaziah , king of Judah , went out in their chariots to meet Jehu . They came face to face with him at the field of Naboth the Jezreelite .
When Joram saw Jehu he said : » Do you come in peace , Jehu ? « He said in reply : » What peace is possible while all the land is full of the disgusting sins of your mother Jezebel , and her secret arts of witchcraft ? «
Then Joram turned his horses and fled . He said to Ahaziah : » Broken faith , O Ahaziah ! «
Jehu drew his bow with his full strength and sent an arrow , wounding Joram between the arms . The arrow came out at his heart , and he went down on his face in his chariot .
Jehu said to Bidkar , his captain : » Pick him up , and put him in the field of Naboth the Jezreelite . I remember when you and I were riding together after Ahab , his father . Jehovah offered this prophesy against him .
» Even as I saw the blood of Naboth and his sons yesterday , ‘ I will pay you back in this field , ’ ’ declares Jehovah . Now take him and throw him into the field as Jehovah predicted . «
When King Ahaziah of Judah saw this , he fled on the road leading to Beth Haggan . Jehu pursued him and ordered : » Shoot him down in his chariot . « They shot him at Gur Pass , near Ibleam . Ahaziah continued to flee until he got to Megiddo , where he died .
His servants brought him in a chariot to Jerusalem . They buried him in a tomb with his ancestors in the City of David .
Ahaziah became king over Judah . It was in the eleventh year of the rule of Joram , the son of Ahab .
Jehu went to Jezreel . Jezebel had news of what happened . Painting her eyes and dressing her hair with ornaments , she put her head out of the window .
As Jehu entered the town , she said : » Have you come in peace , you Zimri , who killed his master ? «
Then , looking up to the window , he said : » Who is on my side , who ? « Two or three eunuchs look out at him .
He said : » Take her and throw her out the window . « So they threw her down with force . Her blood splattered on the wall and on the horses . She was crushed under their feet .
He came in and ate and drank . He said : » Now see to this cursed woman . Bury her body in the earth , for she is a king's daughter . «
They went to bury her , but they found nothing to bury . There were only the bones of her head , and her feet , and parts of her hands .
So they came back and told him about it . He said : » This is what Jehovah said by his servant Elijah the Tishbite : ‘ In the heritage of Jezreel the flesh of Jezebel will become food for dogs .
» ‘ The dead body of Jezebel will be like waste dropped on the face of the earth in the heritage of Jezreel . They will not be able to say : » This is Jezebel . « ’ «
Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria . Jehu sent letters to Samaria , to the rulers of the town , and to the elders , and to those who took care of the sons of Ahab . The letter stated :
» You are in charge of the king's descendants , and you have at your disposal chariots , horses , weapons , and fortified cities . As soon as you receive this letter ,
choose the best qualified of the king's descendants and make him king , and fight to defend him . «
The rulers of Samaria were terrified . They said : » How can we oppose Jehu when neither King Joram nor King Ahaziah could ? «
So the officer in charge of the palace and the official in charge of the city , together with the leading citizens and the guardians , sent this message to Jehu : » We are your servants , and we are ready to do anything you say . But we will not make anyone king . Do whatever you think best . «
Jehu wrote them another letter : » If you are with me and are ready to follow my orders , bring the heads of King Ahab's descendants to me at Jezreel by this time tomorrow . « The seventy descendants of King Ahab were under the care and were being brought up by the leading citizens of Samaria .
As soon as Jehu's letter arrived , the leaders of Samaria killed all seventy of Ahab's descendants and put their heads in baskets , and sent them to Jehu at Jezreel .
Jehu was informed that the heads of Ahab's descendants had been brought . He ordered them to be piled up in two heaps at the city gate and left there until the following morning .
In the morning he went out and said to all the people there : » You are upright people . It is true that I made designs against my master , and put him to death . Who is responsible for the death of all these ?
» You may be certain that nothing Jehovah said about the family of Ahab will be without effect . Jehovah has done what he said by his servant Elijah . «
Jehu put to death all the rest of the seed of Ahab in Jezreel , and all his relations and his near friends and his priests , till there were no more of them .
Jehu then left for Samaria . He was at the meeting-place of the shepherds of the sheep .
He came across the brothers of Ahaziah , king of Judah , and asked : » Who are you ? « They replied : » We are the brothers of Ahaziah , king of Judah . We are going down to see the children of the king and of the queen . «
He ordered : » Take them alive . « So they took them alive and then killed them at the cistern of the shearing house . He killed all forty-two of them .
When he left there he met Jehonadab , the son of Rechab . He greeted him and said to him : » Is your heart true to mine , as mine is to yours ? « Jehonadab in answer said : » It is . « Jehu said : » If it is give me your hand . « He gave him his hand and he made him come up into his chariot .
He said : » Come with me and see how I am on fire with zeal for Jehovah’s cause . « So he made him go with him in his chariot .
When Jehu arrived at Samaria , he put to death all those of Ahab's family who were still in Samaria . There were no more of them , as Jehovah had said to Elijah .
Jehu assembled all the people and said to them : » Ahab was Baal's servant in a small way , but Jehu will be his servant on a great scale .
» Now send for all the prophets of Baal , all his servants and priests , to come to me . Let no one stay away for I have a great offering to make to Baal . Anyone who is not present will be put to death . « Jehu did this with deceit . It was his purpose to destroy the servants of Baal .
Jehu said : » Let there be a special holy meeting for the worship of Baal . « So a public statement was made .
Jehu sent through all Israel ; and all the servants of Baal came , not one kept away . They entered the house of Baal . It was full from one end to the other end .
Jehu said to the keeper of the robes : » Get out robes for all the servants of Baal . « So he got out robes for them .
Jehu , with Jehonadab , the son of Rechab , went into the house of Baal . He said to the servants of Baal : » Make a search with care , to see that no servant of Jehovah is with you , but only servants of Baal . «
They went in to make offerings and burned offerings . Jehu put eighty men outside . He told them : » If any man whom I give into your hands escapes , he who lets him go will forfeit his own life for that life . «
As soon as he finished offering the burned offering Jehu said to the armed men and the captains : » Go in and put them to death ! Do not let one come out ! « So they put them to the sword . Pulling the images to the ground , they went into the holy place of the house of Baal .
They removed the image of Asherah from the house of Baal and burned it .
The altar of Baal was pulled down and the house of Baal was broken up and made an unclean place , as it is to this day .
Jehu put an end to the worship of Baal in Israel .
But Jehu did not keep himself from all the sins of Jeroboam , the son of Nebat , and the evil he made Israel do . The gold calves were still worshiped in Bethel and in Dan .
Jehovah said to Jehu : » You have done well by doing what is right in my eyes . You carried out my purpose for the family of Ahab . Therefore your sons will be kings of Israel to the fourth generation . «
But Jehu did not take care to keep the law of Jehovah with all his heart . He did not keep himself from the sin that Jeroboam did and made Israel do .
Jehovah began to reduce the size of Israel's territory . King Hazael of Syria conquered all the Israelite territory
east of the Jordan , as far south as the town of Aroer on the Arnon River . This included the territories of Gilead and Bashan , where the tribes of Gad , Reuben , and East Manasseh lived .
Everything else that Jehu did , including his brave deeds , is recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel .
He died and was buried in Samaria . His son Jehoahaz succeeded him as king .
Jehu had ruled in Samaria as king of Israel for twenty-eight years .
King Ahaziah's mother Athaliah learned of her son's murder . She gave orders for all the members of the royal family to be killed .
Only Ahaziah's son Jehoash escaped . He was about to be killed with the others , but was rescued by his aunt Jehosheba , who was King Jehoram's daughter and Ahaziah's half sister . She hid him and his nurse in a bedroom in the Temple .
Jehosheba took care of the boy and kept him hidden in the Temple for six years . During this time Athaliah ruled as queen .
In the seventh year Jehoiada the priest sent for the officers in charge of the royal bodyguard and of the palace guards , and told them to come to the Temple . He made them agree under oath to what he planned to do . He showed them King Ahaziah's son Joash
and gave them the following orders : » When you come on duty on the Sabbath , one third of you are to guard the palace .
» One third are to stand guard at the Sur Gate . The other third are to stand guard at the gate behind the other guards .
» The two groups that go off duty on the Sabbath are to stand guard at the Temple to protect the king .
» You are to guard King Jehoash with drawn swords and stay with him wherever he goes . Anyone who comes near you is to be killed . «
The officers obeyed Jehoiada's instructions and brought their men to him , those going off duty on the Sabbath and those going on duty .
He gave the officers the spears and shields that had belonged to King David and had been kept in the Temple .
He stationed the men with drawn swords all around the front of the Temple , to protect the king .
Then Jehoiada led Joash out and placed the crown on his head . He gave him a copy of the laws governing kingship . Then Jehoash was anointed and proclaimed king . The people clapped their hands and shouted : » Long live the king ! «
Queen Athaliah heard the noise being made by the guards and the people . She hurried to the Temple , where the crowd had gathered .
There she saw the new king standing by the column at the entrance of the Temple , as was the custom . The officers and the trumpeters surrounded him , and the people were all shouting joyfully and blowing trumpets . Athaliah tore her clothes in distress and shouted : » Treason ! Treason ! «
Jehoiada the priest did not want Athaliah killed in the Temple area . He ordered the army officers : » Take her out between the rows of guards , and kill anyone who tries to rescue her . «
They seized her and took her to the palace . There at the Horse Gate they killed her .
The priest Jehoiada had King Jehoash and the people make a covenant with Jehovah that they would be Jehovah’s people . He also made a covenant between the king and the people .
The people went to the temple of Baal and tore it down . They smashed the altars and the idols , and killed Mattan , the priest of Baal , in front of the altars . Jehoiada put guards on duty at the Temple ,
Jehoiada the priest , the officers , the royal bodyguard , and the palace guards escorted the king from the Temple to the palace . All the people followed them . Jehoash entered by the Guard Gate and took his place on the royal throne .
All the people were happy . The city was quiet , now that Athaliah had been killed in the palace .
Jehoash was seven years old when he became king .
Jehoash became king of Judah . It was the seventh year of Jehu's rule over Israel . Jehoash ruled for forty years in Jerusalem . His mother's name was Zibiah of Beersheba .
Jehoash did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah all his days , because he was guided by the teaching of Jehoiada the priest .
The high places were not taken away . The people continued making offerings and burning them in the high places .
Jehoash said to the priests : » All the money of the holy things , which comes into the house of Jehovah , the amount fixed for every man's payment , and all the money given by any man freely by motivation of his heart ,
» Let the priests take , every man from his friends and neighbors , to make good what is damaged in the Temple , wherever it is to be seen . «
But in the twenty-third year of King Jehoash , the priests had not made good the damaged parts of the Temple .
He called in Jehoiada and the other priests and asked them : » Why are you not repairing the Temple ? From now on you are not to keep the money you receive . You must hand it over , so that the repairs can be made . «
The priests agreed to this and also agreed not to make the repairs in the Temple .
Then Jehoiada took a box , made a hole in the lid , and placed the box by the altar , on the right side as one enters the Temple . The priests on duty at the entrance put in the box all the money given by the worshipers .
Whenever there was a large amount of money in the box , the royal secretary and the High Priest would come , melt down the silver , and weigh it .
After recording the exact amount , they would hand the silver over to the men in charge of the work in the Temple . These would pay the carpenters , the builders ,
the masons , and the stonecutters , buy the timber and the stones used in the repairs , and pay all other necessary expenses .
None of the money was used to pay for making silver cups , bowls , trumpets , or tools for tending the lamps , or any other article of silver or of gold .
It was all used to pay the workers and to buy the materials used in the repairs .
The men in charge of the work were very honest . There was no need to require them to account for the funds .
The money given for the repayment offerings and for the offerings for sin was not deposited in the box . It belonged to the priests .
King Hazael of Syria attacked the city of Gath and conquered it . Then he decided to attack Jerusalem .
King Jehoash of Judah took all the offerings that his predecessors Jehoshaphat , Jehoram , and Ahaziah had dedicated to Jehovah , added to them his own offerings and all the gold in the treasuries of the Temple and the palace , and sent them all as a gift to King Hazael , who then led his army away from Jerusalem .
The rest of the history of Jehoash is recorded in The Annals of the Kings of Judah .
His own officials plotted against him and killed him at the House of the Mound on the road that goes down to Silla .
Jehoash's officials Jozacar , son of Shimeath , and Jehozabad , son of Shomer , executed him . They buried him with his ancestors in the City of David . His son Amaziah succeeded him as king .
Jehoahaz , the son of Jehu , became king over Israel in Samaria . He ruled for seventeen years . It was the twenty-third year of Joash , son of Ahaziah , king of Judah .
He did evil in the eyes of Jehovah , copying the sins of Jeroboam , the son of Nebat , which he did and made Israel do . He did not keep himself from them .
The wrath of Jehovah burned against Israel ! He gave them up into the power of Hazael , king of Aram , and into the power of Benhadad , the son of Hazael , again and again .
Then Jehoahaz prayed to Jehovah . Jehovah listened to him . He saw how cruelly the king of Aram crushed Israel .
Jehovah gave Israel a savior , so that they became free from the hands of the Aramaeans . The children of Israel were living in their tents as in the past .
Still they did not give up the sin of Jeroboam . This he made Israel do and they continued . There was an image of Asherah in Samaria .
Out of all his army , Jehoahaz had only fifty horsemen and ten carriages and ten thousand footmen . The king of Aram had given them up to destruction , crushing them like dust .
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz , and all he did , and his great power are recorded in the Book of the History of the Kings of Israel .
Jehoahaz went to rest with his fathers . He was buried at Samaria . Joash his son became king .
In the thirty-seventh year of the rule of Jehoash king of Judah , Joash son of Jehoahaz became king over Israel in Samaria . He ruled for sixteen years .
He did evil in the eyes of Jehovah , not turning away from the sin of Jeroboam , the son of Nebat , which he did and made Israel do . He continued sinning .
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash , and all he did , and the force with which he went to war against Amaziah , king of Judah , are recorded in the Book of the History of the Kings of Israel .
Joash went to rest with his fathers . They buried Jehoash in Samaria with the kings of Israel . Jeroboam took his place as king .
Elisha became ill with the disease that caused his death . Jehoash , king of Israel , came down to him , and weeping over him said : » My father , my father , the chariot of Israel and its horsemen ! «
Elisha said to him : » Take bow and arrows « So he took bow and arrows .
He said to the king of Israel : » Put your hand on the bow « So he put his hand on it ; and Elisha put his hands on the king's hands .
Then he said : » Let the window be open to the east . « So he got it open . Then Elisha said : » Let the arrow go ! « So he let it go . He said : » Jehovah’s arrow of salvation , of salvation over Aram for you will overcome the Aramaeans in Aphek and put an end to them . «
He said : » Take the arrows ! « So he took them . He said to the king of Israel : » Send them down into the earth . « He did so three times and no more .
Then the man of God was angry with him and said : » If you had done it five or six times , then you would have overcome Aram completely . Now you will only overcome them three times .
Elisha died and they buried him . Now in the spring of the year , armed bands of Moabites frequently came , overrunning the land .
While they were burying a dead man they saw a band coming . They put the man quickly into the place where Elisha's body was . The dead man’s body touched Elisha's bones . The man came to life again and got up on his feet .
Israel was crushed under the power of Hazael , king of Aram , all the days of Jehoahaz .
But Jehovah was kind to them and had pity on them , caring for them , because of his agreement with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . He would not put them to destruction or send them away from his presence until now .
Then Hazael king of Aram died . Benhadad his son became king in his place .
Jehoash son of Jehoahaz captured again from Benhadad , the son of Hazael , the towns he had taken from Jehoahaz , his father , in war . Three times Jehoash defeated him and recovered the towns of Israel .
Amaziah son of Jehoash became king of Judah . It was in the second year of Jehoash son of Joahaz king of Israel .
Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king . He ruled in Jerusalem for twenty-nine years . His mother's name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem .
He did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah . Though not like David his forefather ; he did as Joash his father had done .
Still the high places were not taken away . The people continued making offerings and burning them in the high places .
As soon as he firmly established the kingdom he immediately put to death those servants who had taken the life of his father , the king .
But he did not put their children to death . The orders of Jehovah recorded in the book of the law of Moses say : » The fathers are not to be put to death for the children , or the children for their fathers ; but each man shall be put to death for his own sin . «
He put to the sword twelve thousand men of Edom in the Valley of Salt . He captured Sela in war , and named it Joktheel , as it is to this day .
Then Amaziah sent representatives to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu , king of Israel , saying : » Come let us have a meeting face to face . «
Jehoash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah , saying : » The thorn-tree in Lebanon sent to the cedar in Lebanon , saying : ‘ Give your daughter to my son for a wife . ’ ’ A beast from the woodland in Lebanon went by , crushing the thorn under his feet .
» It is true that you have overcome Edom and your heart is uplifted . Let that glory be enough for you and stay in your own country . Why do you make causes for trouble , putting yourself and Judah with you in danger of downfall ? «
But Amaziah paid no attention . So Jehoash king of Israel went to Amaziah king of Judah to meet face to face at Bethshemesh in Judah .
Judah was defeated by Israel and every man fled home .
Jehoash king of Israel made Amaziah king of Judah son of Jehoash , son of Ahaziah , prisoner at Bethshemesh . He went to Jerusalem and had the wall of Jerusalem pulled down from the Gate of Ephraim to the gate in the angle , six hundred feet .
He took all the gold and silver and all the vessels in the Temple of Jehovah and in the storehouse of the king , together with those whose lives would be the price of broken faith , and went back to Samaria .

He got back the old limits of Israel from the way into Hamath to the sea of the Arabah . This was what Jehovah said by his servant Jonah , the son of Amittai , the prophet of Gathhepher .
Jehovah saw the bitter affliction of Israel . There was no one left , bond or free . There was no help for Israel .
Jehovah had not said that the name of Israel was to be taken away from the earth . So he gave them a savior in Jeroboam , the son of Joash .

He was twenty-five years old when he became king . He ruled sixteen years in Jerusalem . His mother's name was Jerusha daughter of Zadok .
Jotham did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah , as his father Uzziah had done .
But he did not take away the high places . The people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places . He was the builder of the higher gate of the Temple of Jehovah .
The rest of the acts of Jotham are recorded in the Book of the History of the Kings of Judah .
At that time Jehovah first sent Rezin , king of Aram , and Pekah , son of Remaliah , against Judah .
Jotham died and was buried in the royal tombs in David's City . His son Ahaz succeeded him as king .
Ahaz son of Jotham became king of Judah . It was in the seventeenth year of the reign of Pekah son of Remaliah as king of Israel .
Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king . He ruled sixteen years in Jerusalem . He did not do what was right in the eyes of Jehovah his God , as David his father did .
He walked in ways of the kings of Israel . He even offered his son to walk through the fire . He copied the disgusting ways of the nations . Jehovah sent the people of the nations out of the land before the children of Israel .
He made offerings and burned them on the high places and on the hills and under every green tree .
Rezin king of Aram , and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came to Jerusalem to make war . They attacked Ahaz but could not conquer him .
Then the king of Edom got Elath back for Edom , and sent the Jews out of Elath . The Edomites returned to Elath where they are living to this day .

Ahaz took the silver and gold in the Temple of Jehovah and in the king's storehouse , and sent them as an offering to the king of Assyria .
The king of Assyria , in answer to his request , went up against Damascus and captured it . He took its people away as prisoners to Kir , and put Rezin to death .
Then King Ahaz went to Damascus for a meeting with Tiglathpileser king of Assyria . There he saw the altar at Damascus . King Ahaz sent a drawing of the altar , giving the design of it and all the details of its structure to Urijah the priest .
Urijah made an altar from the drawing King Ahaz sent from Damascus . He had it ready by the time King Ahaz came back from Damascus .
When the king came from Damascus , he saw the altar . He went up on it and made an offering .
He made his burned offering and his meal offering and his drink offering there , draining out the blood of his peace offerings on the altar .
He removed the copper alter that was before Jehovah from the front of the Temple between his altar and the Temple of Jehovah . He put it on the north side of his altar .
King Ahaz gave orders to Urijah the priest : » Make the morning burned offering and the evening meal offering and the king's burned offering and meal offering , with the burned offerings of all the people and their meal offerings and drink offerings , on the great altar . Put on it all the blood of the burned offerings and of the animals that are offered . But the bronze altar will be for my use to get directions from Jehovah . «
Urijah the priest did everything as the king said .
King Ahaz took off the sides of the wheeled bases , and took down the great water-vessel from off the copper bulls which were under it and put it on a floor of stone .
He removed the covered way they built in the Temple court and the king’s outer entrance . This was because of the king of Assyria .
The rest of the things Ahaz did are recorded in the Book of the History of the Kings of Judah .

Hoshea son of Elah became king over Israel in Samaria . This was in the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah . Hoshea ruled for nine years .
He did evil in the eyes of Jehovah . Though he was not like the kings of Israel before him .
Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against him . Hoshea became his servant and sent him offerings .
Hoshea's treachery became clear to the king of Assyria . He had sent representatives to the king of Egypt . He did not send his offering to the king of Assyria like he did in previous years . So the king of Assyria had him put in chains and locked in prison .
Then the king of Assyria invaded the land and advanced to Samaria . He besieged the city for three years .
In the ninth year of Hoshea , the king of Assyria captured Samaria . He led the Israelites away to Assyria . He stationed them in Halah and Habor on the Gozan River , and in the towns of the Medes .
The wrath intense anger of Jehovah came on Israel because they had done evil against Jehovah their God , who took them out of the land of Egypt from under the yoke of Pharaoh , king of Egypt . They worshipped other gods .
They lived by the rules of the nations whom Jehovah sent out from before the children of Israel .
The children of Israel secretly did things that were not right according to Jehovah their God . They built high places for themselves in all their towns , from the watchtower to the walled towns .
They erected pillars of stone and wood on every high hill and under every green tree .
They burned their offerings in all the high places , as those nations did whom Jehovah sent away from them . They did evil things , moving Jehovah to anger .
They made themselves servants of disgusting things . Even though Jehovah said : » You should not do this . «
Jehovah sent his messengers and prophets to warn Israel and Judah : » Abandon your evil ways and obey my commands . The commandments contained in the Law I gave to your ancestors . I handed them on to you through my servants the prophets . «
They would not obey . They were stubborn like their ancestors . They did not trust in Jehovah their God .
They refused to obey his instructions . They did not keep the covenant he made with their ancestors . They disregarded his warnings . They worshiped worthless idols and became worthless themselves . They followed the customs of the surrounding nations , disobeying Jehovah’s command not to imitate them .
They broke all the laws of Jehovah their God . They made two metal bull-calves to worship . They also made an image of the goddess Asherah . Also they worshiped the stars and served the god Baal .
They caused their sons and their daughters to go through the fire to be sacrificed . They made use of secret arts and unnatural powers , and gave themselves up to doing evil in the eyes of Jehovah , till they provoked him to anger .
Jehovah was very angry with Israel . He removed them from his sight . Only the tribe of Judah kept its place .
But even Judah did not obey the commands of Jehovah their God . They were guided by the rules Israel made .
So Jehovah would have nothing to do with all the offspring of Israel . He caused trouble for them . He gave them up into the hands of their attackers , till he had sent them away from before his face .
He tore Israel from the house of David and made Jeroboam son of Nebat king . Jeroboam drove them away from the laws of Jehovah and made them do a great sin .
The children of Israel walked in all the sins Jeroboam committed . They did not depart from these sins .
Jehovah removed Israel from his sight as he said he would through all his servants the prophets . Israel was taken away from their land to Assyria , to this day .
Then the king of Assyria took men from Babylon and from Cuthah and Avva and Hamath and Sepharvaim , and put them in the towns of Samaria in place of the children of Israel . They acquired Samaria for their heritage , living in its towns .
When they first lived there they did not respect Jehovah . So Jehovah sent lions among them , causing some of them to die .
They said to the king of Assyria : » The nations you have taken as prisoners and put in the towns of Samaria have no knowledge of the way of the god of the land . He has sent lions among them causing their death . This is because they have no knowledge of his way . «
Then the king of Assyria gave orders , saying : » Send one of the priests you took from there . Let him live there and teach the people the way of the god of the land . «
So one of the priests they had taken away as a prisoner from Samaria came back . He lived in Bethel and taught them how to worship Jehovah .
EVERY NATION MADE GODS FOR THEMSELVES . They put them in the houses of the high places the Samaritans had made .
The men of Babylon made Succothbenoth and the men of Cuth made Nergal , and the men of Hamath made Ashima ,
The Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak , and the Sepharvites gave their children to be burned in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech , the gods of Sepharvaim .
So they worshipped Jehovah . They appointed priests from the people for the high places . The priests were to make offerings for them in the houses of the high places .
They worshipped Jehovah , but they gave honor to their gods like the nations did from whom they had been taken as prisoners .
So to this day they go on in their old ways . They do not worship Jehovah . They do not keep his orders , his ways , or the law Jehovah gave to the children of Jacob . They are the ones he gave the name Israel .
Jehovah made an agreement with them and gave them orders , saying : You are to have no other gods . You are not to worship them or be their servants or make them offerings .
» Jehovah took you out of the land of Egypt with his great power and his outstretched arm . He is your God , to whom you are to give worship and make offerings :
» You are to obey and do forever the law he put in writing for you . You are to have no other gods .
» You are to keep in memory the agreement I made with you . You are to have no other gods .
» You are to worship Jehovah your God . It is he who will give you salvation from the hands of all who are against you . «
But they paid no attention and they continued in their old way .
So these nations worshiped Jehovah and they still served the images idols they had made . Their children and their children's children did the same . They do just as their fathers did to this very day .
Hezekiah son of Ahaz became king of Judah . It was in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel .
Hezekiah was twenty-five years old when he became king . He ruled in Jerusalem for twenty-nine years . His mother's name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah .
He did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah as David his father had done .
He removed the high places . He broke the stone pillars to bits , and cut down the Asherah poles . The brass snake that Moses had made was crushed to powder at his command , because in those days the children of Israel had offerings burned before it , and he gave it the name Nehushtan .
Hezekiah had faith in Jehovah , the God of Israel . There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah who were before him .
For his heart was fixed on Jehovah . He did not turn from his ways . Hezekiah obeyed Jehovah’s commandments that Jehovah gave to Moses .
Jehovah was with Hezekiah . He did well in everything he did . He took up arms against the king of Assyria and was his servant no longer .
He defeated the Philistines as far as Gaza and its limits , from the tower of the watchman to the walled town .
It was the fourth year of King Hezekiah , the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel . Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria and laid siege to it .
It was captured at the end of three years . Samaria was taken in the sixth year of Hezekiah's rule , which was the ninth year of Hoshea , king of Israel .
The king of Assyria took Israel away as prisoners into Assyria . They placed them in Halah and in Habor on the river Gozan , and in towns of the Medes .
They did not obey the voice of Jehovah their God . In fact they went against his agreement , even against everything ordered by Moses , the servant of Jehovah . They did not listen to or obey Jehovah .
Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah , Sennacherib , king of Assyria , came up against all the walled towns of Judah and took them .
Hezekiah sent a message to Sennacherib at Lachish : » I have done wrong . Stop your attack and I will pay whatever you demand . « The emperor's answer was that Hezekiah should send him ten tons of silver and one ton of gold .
Hezekiah sent him all the silver in the Temple and in the palace treasury .
Hezekiah had the gold from the doors of Jehovah’s Temple and from the doorposts plated by him . He stripped it off and gave it to the king of Assyria .
The king of Assyria sent his commander-in-chief Tartan , his quartermaster , and his field commander with a large army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem . They stood at the channel for the Upper Pool on the road to the Laundryman's Field .
They sent for the king , and Eliakim , the son of Hilkiah , who was over the house , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah , the son of Asaph , the recorder , came out to them .
The Rabshakeh said to them : » Say to Hezekiah : These are the words of the great king , the king of Assyria : » In what are you placing your hope ?
» You say you have counsel and military strength for war . These are only words . To whom are you looking for support that you rebel against me ?
» You rely on Egypt that broken reed of a staff . If a man leans on it relies on its power his hand strength will be pierced wounded diminished . So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who put their faith in him .
» If you say to me : We trust in Jehovah our God , is he not the one whose high places and altars have been taken away by Hezekiah . For he told Judah and Jerusalem that worship may only be given before this altar in Jerusalem ?
» And now , make an agreement with my master , the king of Assyria , and I will give you two thousand horses , if you are able to put horsemen on them .
» How then can you put to shame the least of my master's servants ? You put your hope in Egypt for chariots and horsemen :
» Have I now come to destroy this place without Jehovah ? It was Jehovah who said to me : ‘ Go up against this land and make it waste . « ’
Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah , and Shebna and Joah said to the Rabshakeh the commander : » Will you kindly make use of the Aramaean language in talking to your servants . We are used to it . Do not use the Jews' language in the hearing of the people on the wall . «
He replied : » Do you think you and the king are the only ones the king sent me to say these things ? No , I am also talking to the people who are sitting on the wall . They will have to eat their excrement and drink their own urine , just as you will . «
The official stood up and shouted in Hebrew : » Listen to what the king of Assyria is telling you !
» He warns you : ‘ Do not let Hezekiah deceive you . Hezekiah cannot save you . ’
» Do not let Hezekiah convince you to rely on Jehovah . Do not think that Jehovah will save you or that he will stop our Assyrian army from capturing you . «
» Do not listen to Hezekiah . The king of Assyria commands you to come out of the city and surrender . Make peace with me and you will be allowed to eat grapes from your own vines and figs from your own trees , and to drink water from your own wells cisterns .
» The king will resettle you in a country much like your own . There are vineyards to give wine and there is grain for making bread there . It is a land of olives , olive oil , and honey . Do what he commands and you will not die . Do not let Hezekiah fool you into thinking Jehovah will rescue you .
» Did the gods of other nations save their countries from the king of Assyria ?
» Where are they now ? Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad ? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim , Hena , and Ivvah ? Did anyone save Samaria ?
» When did any of the gods of all these countries ever save their country from our king ? What makes you think Jehovah can save Jerusalem ? «
The people kept quiet . They did as King Hezekiah told them . They did not say a word .
Then Eliakim , Shebna , and Joah tore their clothes in grief . They reported to the king what the Assyrian official had said .
When King Hezekiah heard their report he tore his clothes in grief . He dressed in sackcloth and went to the Temple of Jehovah .
He sent Eliakim the official in charge of the palace , Shebna the court secretary , and the senior priests to the prophet Isaiah , son of Amoz . They also were dressed in sackcloth .
They said to him : » This is what Hezekiah says : ‘ Today is a day filled with misery , punishment , and disgrace . We are like a woman who is about to give birth but does not have the strength to do it .
» ‘ The Assyrian emperor sent his chief official to insult the living God . May Jehovah your God hear these insults and punish those who spoke them . So pray to God for those of our people who survive . ’ «
King Hezekiah's men went to Isaiah .
Isaiah responded to them : » Tell this to your master : ‘ This is what Jehovah says : » Do not be afraid of the message you heard when the Assyrian king's assistants slandered me .
» I am going to put a spirit in him so that he will hear a rumor and return to his own country . I will have him assassinated in his own country . « ’ «
The field commander returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah . He had heard that the king left Lachish .
Sennacherib heard that King Tirhakah of Sudan was coming to fight him . Sennacherib sent messengers to Hezekiah , saying :
» Tell King Hezekiah of Judah : ‘ Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you by saying that Jerusalem will not be put under the control of the king of Assyria .
» ‘ You heard what the kings of Assyria did to all countries . They totally destroyed them . Will you be rescued ?
» ‘ Did the gods of the nations that my ancestors destroyed rescue Gozan , Haran , Rezeph , and the people of Eden who were in Telassar ?
» ‘ Where is the king of Hamath ? Where is the king of Arpad ? And where is the king of the cities of Sepharvaim , Hena , and Ivvah ? ’ «
Hezekiah read the letters from the messengers . Then he went to Jehovah’s Temple and shared them with Jehovah .
He prayed : » Jehovah of Hosts , God of Israel , you are enthroned above the angels . You alone are God of all the kingdoms of the earth . You made heaven and earth .
» Turn your ear listen pay attention to me , O Jehovah , and listen . Open your eyes , Jehovah , and see . Listen to the message Sennacherib sent to defy the living God .
» It is true Jehovah . The kings of Assyria have devastated nations .
» They threw the gods from these countries into fires because these gods are not real gods . They are only wooden and stone statues made by human hands . So the Assyrians have destroyed them .
» Rescue us from Assyria's control , O Jehovah our God , so that all the kingdoms on earth will know that you alone are Jehovah God . «
Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah : » This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says : ‘ You prayed to me about King Sennacherib of Assyria . I have heard you .
» This is Jehovah’s message to Sennacherib : ‘ My people , the virgin daughter of Zion , despise you and laugh at you . My people in Jerusalem shake their heads behind your back .
» ‘ Whom are you defying and slandering ? Against whom are you shouting ? Who are you looking at so arrogantly ? It is the Holy One of Israel !
» ‘ You defy Jehovah and through your servants you say : ‘ With my many chariots I ride up the high mountains , up the slopes of Lebanon . I cut down its tallest cedars and its finest cypresses . I travel to its most distant borders and its most fertile forests .
» ‘ I will dig wells and drink foreign water . I will dry up all the streams of Egypt with the soles of my feet . ’ «
» Have you not heard ? I did this long ago . I planned it in the past . Now I make it happen so that you will turn fortified cities into piles of rubble .
» The inhabitants of these cities are weak , discouraged , and ashamed . They will be like plants in the field , like fresh green grass on the roofs , scorched before it grows up .
» I know when you get up and sit down . I know when you go out and come in . I know how you rage against me .
» Since you rage against me and you boast in my ears , I will put my hook in your nose and my bridle in your mouth . I will make you go back the way you came .
» This will be a sign for you , Hezekiah : You will eat what grows by itself this year and next year . But in the third year you will plant and harvest , plant vineyards , and eat what is produced .
» The remnant in Judah who survives will flourish like plants that send roots deep into the ground and produce fruit .
» There will be a remnant of people in Jerusalem and on Mount Zion who will survive . Jehovah is determined to make this happen .
» This is what Jehovah said about the Assyrian king : ‘ He will not enter this city or shoot a single arrow against it . No soldiers with shields will come near the city . No siege mounds will be built around it . ’
» He will go back by the same road he came . He will not enter the city . I , Jehovah , have spoken ! «
I will defend this city and protect it . It is for the sake of my own honor and because of the promise I made to my servant David .
It happened that night . Jehovah’s angel killed one hundred and eighty five thousand soldiers in the Assyrian camp . The next morning the Judeans saw all the corpses .
King Sennacherib of Assyria returned to his home at Nineveh and stayed there .
While he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch , Adrammelech and Sharezer assassinated him . They escaped to the land of Ararat . His son Esarhaddon succeeded him as king .
Hezekiah became ill and was about to die . The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz said to him : » This is what Jehovah says : ‘ Give final instructions to your household . You will not recover . You will die . ’ «
Hezekiah faced the wall and prayed to Jehovah :
» Jehovah , Please remember how I have walked before you in faithfulness and truth . And consider my whole heart devoted to you . I have done what is good in your eyes . « Hezekiah wept bitterly .
Isaiah had not gone as far as the middle courtyard when Jehovah spoke to him :
» Go back and tell Hezekiah , the leader of my people : ‘ This is what Jehovah God of your ancestor David says : » I heard your prayer . I saw your tears . Now I will heal you . The day after tomorrow you will go to Jehovah’s Temple .
» I will add fifteen more years to your life . I will rescue you and defend this city from the control of the king of Assyria . I do this for my sake and for the sake of my servant David . « ’ «
Then Isaiah said : » Get a fig cake , and put it on the boil so that the king will get well . «
King Hezekiah said to Isaiah : » What is the sign to prove that Jehovah will heal me and that three days later I will be able to go to the Temple ? «
Isaiah replied : » Jehovah will give you a sign to prove that he will keep his promise . Would you prefer to have the shadow on the stairway go forward ten steps or go back ten steps ? «
Then Hezekiah said : » It is an easy matter to have the shadow go forward ten steps . So have it go back ten steps . «
Isaiah prayed to Jehovah and Jehovah made the shadow go back ten steps on the stairway set up by King Ahaz .
The king of Babylonia , Merodach Baladan son of Baladan heard that King Hezekiah was sick . So he sent him a letter and a present .
Hezekiah welcomed the messengers and showed them his wealth . He showed his silver and gold . He also let them look at his spices and perfumes . He even showed all his military equipment . There was nothing in his storerooms or anywhere in his kingdom that he did not show them .
The prophet Isaiah went to King Hezekiah and asked : » Where did these men come from and what did they say to you ? « Hezekiah answered : » They came from a very distant country , from Babylonia . «
Isaiah then said : » What did they see in your palace ? « Hezekiah replied : » They saw everything in my palace . I showed them everything in my treasury . «
Isaiah said to Hezekiah : » Hear the word of Jehovah ! «
» Jehovah says : ‘ The time will come when everything in your palace , everything your ancestors have stored up to this day , will be taken away to Babylon . Nothing will be left .
» ‘ Some of your own descendants will be taken away . They will become officials in the palace of the king of Babylon . ’ «
Hezekiah said to Isaiah : » The word of Jehovah that you spoke is good . He added : » Is it not good that there is peace and security as long as I live ? «
Everything else about Hezekiah , all his heroic acts and how he made the pool and tunnel to bring water into the city is written in the official records of the Kings of Judah .
Hezekiah slept in death with his ancestors . His son Manasseh succeeded him as king .
Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king . He ruled in Jerusalem for fifty-five years . His mother's name was Hephzibah .
He did evil in the eyes of Jehovah . He copied the disgusting ways of those nations Jehovah sent out before the children of Israel .
He built the high places that Hezekiah his father destroyed . He made altars for Baal . Then he made an Asherah as Ahab , king of Israel , had done . Manasseh was a worshipper and servant of all the stars of heaven .
He built heathen altars in the Temple of Jehovah . The same Temple that Jehovah spoke of when he said : » In Jerusalem will I put my name . «
And he built altars for all the stars of heaven in the two outer courts of the Temple of Jehovah .
He made his own son pass through fire . He burned him as an offering to Molech . He practiced reading the future ; gave positions to those who had control of spirits and to wonder-workers . He did much evil in the eyes of Jehovah and provoked him to anger .
He made an image of the goddess Asherah and set it in the Temple of Jehovah . This is the same Temple that Jehovah said to David and to Solomon his son : » In this house , and in Jerusalem , the town which I have made mine out of all the tribes of Israel , I will put my name forever for a very long time .
» And never again will I send the feet of Israel wandering from the land that I gave to their fathers . If only they will take care to do all my orders , and obey all the law my servant Moses gave them . «
But they would not listen . Manasseh enticed them to do evil . In fact they committed more evil than the nations whom Jehovah destroyed before the children of Israel .
Jehovah said through his servants the prophets :
» Manasseh king of Judah committed detestable sins . He did more evil than all the Amorites before him . He enticed Judah to do evil with his false gods .
» ‘ Because of this , ’ ’ says Jehovah the God of Israel : ‘ I will send such evil on Jerusalem and Judah that the ears of all who hear of it will burn .
» ‘ The line of Samaria and the weight of Ahab will be stretched over Jerusalem . Jerusalem will be washed clean as a plate is washed , and turned over on its face .
» ‘ I will discard the rest of my heritage . I will give them into the hands of their enemies . They will take their property and their goods for themselves .
» ‘ Because they have done evil in my eyes . They moved me to anger from the day their fathers came out of Egypt till this day . ’ «
Even more , Manasseh killed many innocent men . He filled Jerusalem from one end to the other with blood . He also caused Judah to sin and do evil in the eyes of Jehovah .
Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh , and all he did , and his sins , are recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah .
So Manasseh went to rest with his fathers . He was buried in the garden of his house , in the garden of Uzza . Amon his son became king in his place .
Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king . He ruled in Jerusalem for two years . His mother's name was Meshullemeth , the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah .
He did evil in the eyes of Jehovah as Manasseh his father had done .
He followed all the practices of his father . He was a servant and worshipper of the false gods to which his father had been a servant .
Amon turned away from Jehovah the God of his fathers . He did not walk in his ways .
The servants of Amon conspired against him . They killed the king in his house .
But the people of the land put to death all those who had taken part in the design against the king . Then they made Josiah his son king in his place .
Now the rest of the acts which Amon did , are recorded in the Book of the History of the Kings of Judah .
He was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza . Josiah his son became king in his place .
Josiah was eight years old when he became king . He ruled in Jerusalem thirty-one years . His mother's name was Jedidah daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath .
He did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah . He walked in the ways of David his father , without turning to the right hand or to the left .
Now in the eighteenth year after he became king , Josiah sent Shaphan son of Azaliah son of Meshullam the scribe , to the Temple of Jehovah . He said to him :
» Go to Hilkiah the high priest . Let him count the money brought into the Temple of Jehovah that the keepers of the door gathered from the people .
» Let them deliver it to the workmen who have oversight of the work of Jehovah’s Temple . Then they can pay it to the workmen who are making good what was damaged in the Temple of Jehovah .
» To the woodworkers and the builders and the stonecutters ; and for getting wood and cut stones for building the Temple .
» Since the workmen are honest , do not require them to account for the money you give them . «
The chief priest Hilkiah told the scribe Shaphan : » I found the Book of the Law in Jehovah’s House . « Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan , who then read it .
The scribe Shaphan reported to the king : » We have taken the money donated in the temple and have given it to the workmen who are in charge of Jehovah’s House . «
Then the scribe Shaphan told the king : The priest Hilkiah has given me a book . Shaphan read it to the king .
When the king heard what the book of the Law said , he tore his clothes in distress .
The king gave an order to the priest Hilkiah , to Ahikam son of Shaphan , Achbor son of Micaiah , the scribe Shaphan , and the royal official Asaiah . He said :
» Go inquire of Jehovah on my behalf and for the people . This is concerning the words in this book that has been found . Jehovah’s fierce anger is directed towards us because our ancestors did not obey the things in this book or do everything written in it . «
So the priest Hilkiah , Ahikam , Achbor , Shaphan , and Asaiah went to talk to the prophet Huldah . She was the wife of Shallum , son of Tikvah and grandson of Harhas . Shallum was in charge of the royal wardrobe . Huldah was living in the Second Part of Jerusalem .
She told them : » This is what Jehovah God of Israel says : Tell the man who sent you to me :
‘ This is what Jehovah says : » I am going to bring disaster on this place and on the people living here . This is according to everything written in the book that the king of Judah has read .
» ‘ I will do this because they abandoned me . They sacrificed to other gods in order to make me furious . Therefore , my burning anger against this place will never be extinguished . « ’ «
Huldah added : » Tell Judah's king who sent you to me to ask Jehovah a question . This is what Jehovah God of Israel says about the words you heard :
‘ You had a change of heart and humbled yourself in front of Jehovah when you heard my words against this place and those who live here . I said that those who live here would be destroyed and cursed . You also tore your clothes in distress and cried in front of me . So I will listen to you , ’ « declares Jehovah .
» That is why I will bring you to your ancestors . I will bring you to your grave in peace . Your eyes will not see any of the disaster I will bring on this place . « ’ « They reported this to the king .
Then the king sent for all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem to join him .
The king went up to the Temple of Jehovah . All the inhabitants of Judah young and old also went to Jehovah’s Temple . Josiah read everything written in the Book of the Promise found in Jehovah’s Temple so they could all hear it .
The king stood beside the pillar and made a promise to Jehovah that he would follow Jehovah and obey his commands , instructions , and laws with all his heart and mind . He confirmed the terms of the promise written in this book . All the people joined in the promise .
Then the king ordered the high priest Hilkiah , the priests who served under Hilkiah , and the doorkeepers to remove from Jehovah’s Temple all utensils that had been made for Baal , Asherah , and the entire army of heaven . Josiah burned the utensils outside Jerusalem . It was in an open field near the Kidron Brook . Then he carried their ashes to Bethel .
He got rid of the pagan priests . The kings of Judah appointed them to sacrifice at the illegal places of worship in the cities of Judah and all around Jerusalem . They had been sacrificing to Baal , the sun god , the moon god , the constellations of the zodiac , and the entire army of heaven .
He removed the pole dedicated to the goddess Asherah from the temple . He took it to the Kidron Valley outside Jerusalem . There he burned it in the Kidron Valley , ground it to dust , and threw its ashes on the tombs of the common people .
He tore down the houses of the male temple cult prostitutes who were in Jehovah’s Temple . This is where women did weaving for Asherah .
He brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah from Geba to Beersheba and made the places where those priests sacrificed unclean . He tore down the worship site at the entrance of the Gate of Joshua , the gate named after the mayor of the city . The worship site was to the left of anyone going through the city gate .
The priests of the illegal worship sites had never gone to Jehovah’s altar in Jerusalem . Instead , they ate their unleavened bread among the other worshipers .
Josiah also made Topheth in the valley of Ben Hinnom unclean so that people would never again sacrifice their sons or daughters by burning them to the god Molech .
He also removed the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the worship of the sun . He burned the chariots used in this worship .
The altars the kings of Judah built on the palace roof above King Ahaz' quarters , King Josiah tore down , along with the altars put up by King Manasseh in the two courtyards of the Temple . He smashed the altars to bits and threw them into Kidron Valley .
The king made the illegal places of worship east of Jerusalem unclean . They were on the southern part of the Hill of Destruction . King Solomon of Israel built them for Astarte the disgusting goddess of the Sidonians . Also made unclean were references to Chemosh the disgusting god of Moab , and Milcom the disgusting god of the Ammonites .
Josiah crushed the sacred stones . He cut down the poles dedicated to Asherah . And he filled their places with human bones .
He also tore down the altar at Bethel the place of worship made by Jeroboam , who had made Israel sin . He tore down both the altar and the place of worship . They burned the worship site . They crushed it into powder and burned the pole dedicated to Asherah .
Josiah turned and saw the tombs on the hill . He sent men to take the bones out of the tombs and burn them on the altar to make it unclean . This fulfilled the word of Jehovah announced by the man of God .
» What is that headstone I see over there ? « Josiah asked . The men of the town said : » It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah . The one who foretold all these things you have done to the altar of Bethel . «
He said : » Let him be . Do not move his bones . « So they let his bones be with the bones of the prophet who came from Samaria .
Josiah removed all the houses of the high places the kings of Israel built in the towns of Samaria . This provoked Jehovah to anger and he did with them as he had done in Bethel .
He killed all the priests of the high places on the altars . Their bones were burned on the altars . Then the king went back to Jerusalem .
The king gave orders to all the people . He said : » Keep the Passover to Jehovah your God , as it says in this book of the law . «
Truly , such a Passover had not been kept in all the days of the judges of Israel or of the kings of Israel or the kings of Judah .
In the eighteenth year of the rule of King Josiah this Passover was kept to Jehovah in Jerusalem .
Josiah removed all the spirit mediums , the foretellers , the images , and the false gods , and all the disgusting things seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem . That way he could establish the words of the agreement recorded in the book Hilkiah the priest discovered in the Temple of Jehovah .
Never before had there been a king like him . He turned to Jehovah with all his heart and his entire mind and all his power . As the Law of Moses says : and after him there was no king like him .
Still the heat of Jehovah’s anger was not turned back from Judah . This is because of all Manasseh had done in moving him to anger .
Jehovah said : » I will send Judah away from before my face , as I have sent Israel . I will have nothing more to do with this town . It is Jerusalem my town . And the holy house of which I said : ‘ My name will be there . ’ «
Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and all he did are recorded in the book of the History of the Kings of Judah .
In his days , Pharaoh Necho , king of Egypt , sent his armies against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates . King Josiah went out against him . Josiah was killed when he saw him at Megiddo .
His servants took his body in a carriage from Megiddo to Jerusalem . They buried him there . The people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah , and put the holy oil on him and made him king in place of his father .
Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king . He ruled in Jerusalem for three months . His mother's name was Hamutal , the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
He did evil in the eyes of Jehovah , as his fathers had done .
And Pharaoh Necho put him in chains at Riblah in the land of Hamath . So that he was not king in Jerusalem . Pharaoh Necho extracted from the land a tax of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold .
Then Pharaoh Necho made Eliakim son of Josiah king in place of Josiah his father . He changed his name to Jehoiakim . He took Jehoahaz away to Egypt , where he remained till he died .
Jehoiakim gave the silver and gold to Pharaoh . He ordered that the land be taxed to get the money . All the people of the land had to give silver and gold in order to make the payment to Pharaoh Necho .
Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king . He ruled in Jerusalem for eleven years . His mother's name was Zebidah daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah .
He did evil in the eyes of Jehovah as his fathers had done .
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded Judah . Jehoiakim king of Judah was forced to serve him for three years . Then he rebelled and fought against him .
Jehovah sent raiding parties of Babylonians , Arameans , Moabites , and Ammonites against Jehoiakim to destroy Judah as Jehovah predicted through his servants the prophets .
This happened to Judah because Jehovah commanded it to happen . He wanted to remove the people of Judah from his sight because of Manasseh's sins and everything he had done ,
and especially because of all the innocent people he killed . Jehovah would not forgive Manasseh for that .
The rest of the acts of Jehoiakim are written in the Book of the History of the Days of the Kings of Judah .
Jehoiakim slept with his fathers . Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place .
The king of Egypt did not leave his own country again because the king of Babylon captured all the territory from the River of Egypt to the Euphrates River . This territory belonged to the king of Egypt .
Jehoiakin was eighteen years old when he became king . He was king for three months in Jerusalem . His mother was Nehushta daughter of Elnathan from Jerusalem .
Following the example of his father , Jehoiachin sinned against Jehovah .
It was during his reign that the Babylonian army , commanded by King Nebuchadnezzar's officers , marched against Jerusalem and besieged it .
During the siege Nebuchadnezzar came to Jerusalem in person .
King Jehoiachin of Judah , along with his mother , his sons , his officers , and the palace officials , surrendered to the Babylonians . In the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign he took Jehoiachin prisoner .
The Babylonians carried off to Babylon all the treasures in the Temple and the palace . As Jehovah foretold , Nebuchadnezzar broke up all the gold utensils King Solomon had made for use in the Temple .
Nebuchadnezzar carried away as prisoners the people of Jerusalem , all the royal princes , and all the leading men , ten thousand in all . He also deported all the skilled workers , including the blacksmiths , leaving only the poorest of the people behind in Judah .
He took Jehoiakin to Babylon as a captive . He also took the king's mother , wives , eunuchs , and the leading citizens of the land from Jerusalem as captives to Babylon .
Included as prisoners were all the men of war , seven thousand of them , and a thousand expert workmen and metalworkers , all of them strong and able to take up arms .
The king of Babylon installed Mattaniah , his father's brother , king in place of Jehoiachin . He changed his name to Zedekiah .
Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king . He was king in Jerusalem for eleven years . His mother's name was Hamutal , daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
He did evil in the eyes of Jehovah , as Jehoiakim had done .
This happened in Jerusalem and Judah because of Jehovah’s anger . It continued until he had sent them all away from before him . Then Zedekiah took up arms and rebelled against the king of Babylon .
Now in the ninth year of his rule , on the tenth day of the tenth month , Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked Jerusalem with all his army . He took his position and laid siege to it . They built earthworks all round the town .
They surrounded the town and laid siege till the eleventh year of King Zedekiah .
On the ninth day of the fourth month , the store of food in the town was almost gone . There was no food for the people of the land .
An opening was made in the wall of the town . All the men of war went in flight by night through the doorway between the two walls by the king's garden . The Chaldaeans were stationed around the town : and the king went by the way toward the plain of Arabah .
But the Chaldaean army went after the king . They overtook him in the lowlands of Jericho . All his army went in flight from him in every direction .
They made the king a prisoner and took him to the king of Babylon at Riblah to be judged .
They put the sons of Zedekiah to death before his eyes . Then they put out his eyes , chained him with iron bands and took him to Babylon .
It was the fifth month , on the seventh day of the month , in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon . Nebuzaradan , the captain of the armed men , a servant of the king of Babylon , came to Jerusalem .
He had the Temple of Jehovah , the king's house and all the houses of Jerusalem , even every great house , burned with fire .
The army of the Chaldaeans under the command of the captain of the army broke down the walls around Jerusalem .
The rest of the people still in the town , and all those who had given themselves up to the king of Babylon , and all the rest of the workmen were taken away as prisoners by Nebuzaradan , the captain of the army .
He let the poorest of the land go on living there , to take care of the vines and the fields .
The copper pillars in the Temple of Jehovah , and the wheeled bases , and the great copper water-vessel in the Temple of Jehovah were broken up by the Chaldaeans . They took the copper to Babylon .
The pots and the spades and the scissors for the lights and the spoons , and all the copper vessels used in Jehovah’s Temple were taken away .
The captain of the guard took all of the incense burners and bowls that were made of gold or silver .
The bronze from the two pillars , the pool , and the stands that Solomon made for Jehovah’s Temple could not be weighed .
One pillar was twenty-seven feet high and had a copper crown on it that was four and one half feet high . The filigree and the pomegranates around the crown were all made of copper . The second pillar and its filigree were the same .
The captain of the guard took the high priest Seraiah , the second priest Zephaniah , and the three doorkeepers .
From the city he also took an army commander , five men who had access to the king whom he found in the city , the scribe who was in charge of the militia , and sixty of the common people whom he found in the city .
Nebuzaradan , the captain of the guard , took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah .
The king of Babylon executed them at Riblah in the territory of Hamath . So the people of Judah were captives when they left their land .
There were people who were still living in the land of Judah . Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , did not take them captive . He made Gedaliah , son of Ahikam , son of Shaphan , ruler over them .
The captains of the armed forces heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah ruler . They brought their men to Gedaliah at Mizpah . Ishmael , the son of Nethaniah , and Johanan , the son of Kareah , and Seraiah , the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite , and Jaazaniah , the son of the Maacathite , came with all their men .
Then Gedaliah gave his oath to them and their men . He said : Have no fear because of the servants of the Chaldaeans . Go on living in the land under the rule of the king of Babylon , and all will be well .
In the seventh month , Ishmael , the son of Nethaniah , the son of Elishama , of the king's seed , came with ten men and made an attack on Gedaliah , causing his death and the death of the Jews and the Chaldaeans who were with him at Mizpah .
Then all the people , small and great , and the captains of the forces , got up and went away to Egypt , for fear of the Chaldaeans .
In the thirty-seventh year after Jehoiachin king of Judah had been taken prisoner , in the twelfth month , on the twenty-seventh day of the month , Evil-merodach , king of Babylon , in the first year of his rule , took Jehoiachin , king of Judah , out of prison .
He said kind things to him and placed his seat higher than the seats of the other kings who were with him in Babylon .
His prison clothing was changed . He was a guest at the king's table every day for the rest of his life .
The king gave him a regular amount of food every day for the rest of his life .

The gatekeepers were on the four sides : east , west , north and south .
Their brothers in their villages had to come from time to time and share their duties for seven-day periods .
But the four principal gatekeepers , who were Levites , were entrusted with the responsibility for the rooms and treasuries in the house of God .
They would spend the night stationed around the house of God , because they had to guard it ; and they had charge of the key for opening it each morning .
Some of them were in charge of the articles used in the temple service ; they counted them when they were brought in and when they were taken out .
Others were assigned to take care of the furnishings and all the other articles of the sanctuary , as well as the flour and wine , and the oil , incense and spices .
But some of the priests took care of mixing the spices .
A Levite named Mattithiah , the firstborn son of Shallum the Korahite , was entrusted with the responsibility for baking the offering bread .
Some of their Kohathite brothers were in charge of preparing for every Sabbath the bread set out on the table .
Those who were musicians , heads of Levite families , stayed in the rooms of the temple and were exempt from other duties because they were responsible for the work day and night .
All these were heads of Levite families , chiefs as listed in their genealogy , and they lived in Jerusalem .
Jeiel the father of Gibeon lived in Gibeon . His wife’s name was Maacah ,
and his firstborn son was Abdon , followed by Zur , Kish , Baal , Ner , Nadab ,
Gedor , Ahio , Zechariah and Mikloth .
Mikloth was the father of Shimeam . They too lived near their relatives in Jerusalem .
Ner was the father of Kish , Kish the father of Saul , and Saul the father of Jonathan , Malki-Shua , Abinadab and Esh-Baal . Ish-Bosheth
The son of Jonathan : Merib-Baal , Mephibosheth who was the father of Micah .
The sons of Micah : Pithon , Melech , Tahrea and Ahaz .
Ahaz was the father of Jadah , Jadah was the father of Alemeth , Azmaveth and Zimri , and Zimri was the father of Moza .
Moza was the father of Binea ; Rephaiah was his son , Eleasah his son and Azel his son .
Azel had six sons , and these were their names : Azrikam , Bokeru , Ishmael , Sheariah , Obadiah and Hanan . These were the sons of Azel .
Now the Philistines fought against Israel . The Israelites fled from them , and many fell slain on Mount Gilboa .
The Philistines pressed hard after Saul and his sons , and they killed his sons Jonathan , Abinadab and Malki-Shua .
The fighting grew fierce around Saul , and when the archers overtook him , they wounded him .
Saul said to his armor-bearer : » Draw your sword and run me through , or these uncircumcised fellows will come and abuse me . « But his armor-bearer was terrified and would not do it . So Saul took his own sword and fell on it .
When the armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead , he too fell on his sword and died .
Saul , his three sons and his entire house died together .
When all the Israelites in the valley saw that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons had died , they abandoned their towns and fled . And the Philistines came and occupied them .
The next day , when the Philistines came to strip the dead they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa .
They stripped him and took his head and his armor , and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news among their idols and their people .
They put his armor in the temple of their gods and hung up his head in the temple of Dagon .
When all the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard of everything the Philistines had done to Saul ,
all their fighting men took the bodies of Saul and his sons and brought them to Jabesh . They buried their bones under the great tree in Jabesh . Then they fasted seven days .
Saul died because of his unfaithfulness to Jehovah . He did not obey the word of Jehovah . He asked a medium to request information from a dead person .
He did not request information from Jehovah . Thus Jehovah killed him and turned the kingship over to David , Jesse’s son .
Then all Israel came together to David at Hebron . They said : » Indeed we are your bone and your flesh .
» In time past , even when Saul was king , you were the one who led Israel out and brought them in . « Jehovah your God said to you : » You will shepherd my people Israel , and be ruler over my people Israel . «
Therefore all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron . David made a covenant with them at Hebron in the presence of Jehovah . Then they anointed David king over Israel , according to the word of Jehovah by Samuel .
David and all Israel went to Jerusalem , which is Jebus , where the Jebusites were , the inhabitants of the land .
Then the inhabitants of Jebus said to David : » You shall not come in here ! « Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion that is , the City of David .
David said : Whoever attacks the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain . Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first , and became chief .
Then David dwelt in the stronghold . That is why they called it the City of David .
He built the city around it , from the stronghold on the mound to the surrounding area . Joab repaired the rest of the city .
David went on and became great , and Jehovah of Hosts was with him .
These were the men in charge of David’s mighty men . They strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom , with all Israel , to make him king , according to the word of Jehovah concerning Israel .
This is the number of the mighty men whom David had : Jashobeam the son of a Hachmonite , chief of the captains ; he had lifted up his spear against three hundred , killed by him at one time .
After him were Eleazar the son of Dodo , the Ahohite , who was one of the three mighty men .
He was with David at Pasdammim . The Philistines were gathered for battle . There was a piece of ground full of barley . And the people fled from the Philistines .
They stationed themselves in the middle of that field , defended it , and killed the Philistines . So Jehovah brought about a great victory .
Now three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David , into the cave of Adullam . The army of the Philistines encamped in the Valley of Rephaim .
David was then in the stronghold , and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem .
David said with longing : » Oh , that someone would give me a drink of water from the well of Bethlehem , which is by the gate ! «
So the three broke through the camp of the Philistines , drew water from the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate . They took it to David . Nevertheless David would not drink it , but poured it out to Jehovah .
He said : » Far be it from me , O my God , that I should do this ! Shall I drink the blood of these men who have placed their lives in jeopardy ? For at the risk of their lives they brought it . « Therefore he would not drink it . The three mighty men did these things .
Abishai the brother of Joab was chief of another three . He had lifted up his spear against three hundred men . He killed them and won a name among these three .
Of the three he was more honored than the other two men . Therefore he became their captain . However he did not attain to the first three .
Benaiah was the son of Jehoiada , the son of a valiant man from Kabzeel , who had done many deeds . He killed two lion-like heroes of Moab . He also had gone down and killed a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day .
And he killed an Egyptian , a man of great height , seven and a half feet tall . Egyptian had a spear like a weaver’s beam in his hand . He went down to him with a staff , wrested the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand , and killed him with his own spear .
These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did , and won a name among three mighty men .
Indeed he was more honored than the thirty , but he did not attain to the first three . David appointed him over his guard .
Also the mighty warriors were Asahel the brother of Joab , Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem ,
Shammoth the Harorite , Helez the Pelonite ,
Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite , Abiezer the Anathothite ,
Sibbechai the Hushathite , Ilai the Ahohite ,
Maharai the Netophathite , Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite ,
Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah , of the sons of Benjamin , Benaiah the Pirathonite ,
Hurai of the brooks of Gaash , Abiel the Arbathite ,
Azmaveth the Baharumite , Eliahba the Shaalbonite ,
the sons of Hashem the Gizonite , Jonathan the son of Shageh the Hararite ,
Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite , Eliphal the son of Ur ,
Hepher the Mecherathite , Ahijah the Pelonite ,
Hezro the Carmelite , Naarai the son of Ezbai ,

Hanan the son of Maachah , Joshaphat the Mithnite ,
Uzzia the Ashterathite , Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite ,
Jediael the son of Shimri , and Joha his brother , the Tizite ,
Eliel the Mahavite , Jeribai and Joshaviah the sons of Elnaam , Ithmah the Moabite ,
Eliel , Obed , and Jaasiel the Mezobaite .
The following men joined David at Ziklag while he was hiding from Saul son of Kish . They were among the warriors who fought beside David in battle .
All of them were expert archers who could shoot arrows or sling stones with their left hand as well as their right . They were all relatives of Saul from the tribe of Benjamin .
Their leader was Ahiezer son of Shemaah from Gibeah ; his brother Joash was second-in-command . These were the other warriors : Jeziel and Pelet , sons of Azmaveth ; Beracah and Jehu from Anathoth ;
Ishmaiah from Gibeon , a famous warrior and leader among the Thirty ; Jeremiah , Jahaziel , Johanan , and Jozabad from Gederah ;

Eluzai , Jerimoth , Bealiah , Shemariah , and Shephatiah from Haruph ;
Elkanah , Isshiah , Azarel , Joezer , and Jashobeam , who were Korahites ;
Joelah and Zebadiah , sons of Jeroham from Gedor .
Some brave and experienced warriors from the tribe of Gad also defected to David while he was at the stronghold in the wilderness . They were expert with both shield and spear , as fierce as lions and as swift as deer on the mountains .
Ezer was their leader . Obadiah was second . Eliab was third .
Mishmannah was fourth . Jeremiah was fifth .
Attai was sixth . Eliel was seventh .
Johanan was eighth . Elzabad was ninth .
Jeremiah was tenth . Macbannai was eleventh .
These warriors from Gad were army commanders . The weakest among them could take on a hundred regular troops , and the strongest could take on a thousand !
They crossed the Jordan River during its seasonal flooding at the beginning of the year and drove out all the people living in the lowlands on both the east and west banks .
Others from Benjamin and Judah came to David at the stronghold .
David went out to meet them and said : » If you have come in peace to help me , we are friends . But if you have come to betray me to my enemies when I am innocent , then may the God of our ancestors see and judge you . «
Then the Spirit came upon Amasai , who later became a leader among the Thirty , and he said : » We are yours , David ! We are on your side , son of Jesse . Peace and prosperity be with you , and success to all who help you , for your God is the one who helps you . « So David let them join him , and he made them officers over his troops .
Some men from Manasseh defected from the Israelite army and joined David when he went with the Philistines to fight against Saul . But as it turned out , the Philistine leaders refused to let David and his men go with them . After much discussion , they sent them back , for they said : » It will cost us our lives if David switches loyalties to Saul and turns against us . «
Here is a list of the men from Manasseh who defected to David as he was returning to Ziklag : Adnah , Jozabad , Jediael , Michael , Jozabad , Elihu , and Zillethai . Each commanded a thousand troops from the tribe of Manasseh .
They helped David chase down bands of raiders , for they were all brave and able warriors who became commanders in his army .
Day after day more men joined David until he had a great army , like the army of God .
These are the numbers of armed warriors who joined David at Hebron . They were all eager to see David become king instead of Saul , just as Jehovah had promised .
From the tribe of Judah , there were six thousand eight hundred warriors armed with shields and spears .
From the tribe of Simeon , there were seven thousand one hundred warriors .
From the tribe of Levi , there were four thousand six hundred troops .
This included Jehoiada , leader of the family of Aaron , who had three thousand seven hundred under his command .
This also included Zadok , a young warrior , with twenty-two members of his family who were all officers .
From the tribe of Benjamin , Saul’s relatives , there were three thousand warriors . Most of the men from Benjamin had remained loyal to Saul until this time .
From the tribe of Ephraim , there were twenty thousand eight hundred warriors , each famous in his own clan .
From the half-tribe of Manasseh west of the Jordan , eighteen thousand men were sent for the express purpose of helping David become king .
From the tribe of Issachar , there were two hundred leaders of the tribe with their relatives . All these men understood the temper of the times and knew the best course for Israel to take .
From the tribe of Zebulun , there were fifty thousand skilled warriors . They were fully armed and prepared for battle and completely loyal to David .
From the tribe of Naphtali , there were one thousand officers and thirty-seven thousand warriors armed with shields and spears .
From the tribe of Dan , there were twenty-eight thousand six hundred warriors , all prepared for battle .
From the tribe of Asher , there were forty thousand trained warriors , all prepared for battle .
From the east side of the Jordan River — where the tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh lived — there were one hundred twenty thousand troops armed with every kind of weapon .
All these men came in battle array to Hebron with the single purpose of making David the king of Israel . In fact , all Israel agreed that David should be their king .
They feasted and drank with David for three days . Their relatives had made preparations for their arrival .
People from as far away as Issachar , Zebulun , and Naphtali brought food on donkeys , camels , mules , and oxen . Vast supplies of flour , fig cakes , raisins , wine ; olive oil , cattle , and sheep were brought to the celebration . There was great joy throughout the land of Israel
David conferred with each of his officers , the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds .
He then said to the whole assembly of Israel : » If it seems good to you and if it is the will of Jehovah our God , let us send word far and wide to the rest of our brothers throughout the territories of Israel , and also to the priests and Levites with them in their towns and pasturelands , to come and join us .
» Let us bring the Ark of our God back to us , for we did not inquire of it during the reign of Saul . «
The whole assembly agreed to do this , because it seemed right to all the people .
David assembled all the Israelites , from the Shihor River in Egypt to Lebo to the entrance to Hamath , to bring the Ark of God from Kiriath Jearim .
David and all the people of Israel with him went to Baalah of Judah Kiriath Jearim . They went to bring the Ark of Jehovah God from there . He is enthroned between the cherubim on the Ark that is called by his name .
They moved the Ark of God from Abinadab’s house on a new cart . Uzzah and Ahio guided it .
David and all the people of Israel celebrated with all their might before God . They did it with songs and with harps , lyres , tambourines , cymbals and trumpets .
When they came to the threshing floor of Kidon , Uzzah reached out his hand to steady the Ark , because the bulls stumbled .
Jehovah’s anger burned against Uzzah . He struck him down because he had put his hand on the Ark . So he died there before God .
David was angry because Jehovah’s wrath had broken out against Uzzah . To this day that place is called Perez Uzzah . Outbreak against Uzzah
David was afraid of God that day and asked : » How can I ever bring the Ark of God to me ? «
He did not take the Ark to be with him in the City of David . Instead , he took it aside to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite .
The Ark of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house for three months . Jehovah blessed his household and everything he had .
Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David . He also sent cedar logs , stonemasons and carpenters to build a palace for him .
David knew that Jehovah had established him as king over Israel and that his kingdom had been highly exalted for the sake of his people Israel .
In Jerusalem David took more wives and became the father of more sons and daughters .
These are the names of the children born to him there : Shammua , Shobab , Nathan , Solomon ,
Ibhar , Elishua , Elpelet ,
Nogah , Nepheg , Japhia ,
Elishama , Beeliada and Eliphelet .
The Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel . So they went up in full force to search for him . David heard about it and went out to meet them .
The Philistines raided the Valley of Rephaim .
David inquired of God : » Should I attack the Philistines ? Will you hand them over to me ? « Jehovah answered him : » Go , I will hand them over to you . «
David and his men went to Baal Perazim . He defeated them there . He said : » As waters break out , God has broken out against my enemies by my hand . « So that place was called Baal Perazim the lord who breaks out .
The Philistines abandoned their gods . So David gave orders to burn them in the fire .
Once more the Philistines raided the valley .
David inquired of God again , and God answered him : » Do not go straight up , but circle around them and attack them in front of the balsam trees .
» As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees , move out to battle . That will mean God has gone out in front of you to strike the Philistine army . «
David did as God commanded him . They struck down the Philistine army all the way from Gibeon to Gezer .
Thus David’s fame spread throughout every land . Jehovah made all the nations fear him .
David constructed buildings for himself in the City of David . Then he prepared a place for God’s Ark and pitched a tent for it .
David insisted that only the Levites carry God’s Ark because Jehovah had chosen them to carry his Ark and to serve him from generation to generation .
David called together all Israel at Jerusalem to bring Jehovah’s Ark to the place he had prepared for it .
David also called together Aaron’s descendants and the Levites .
Leading Kohath’s descendants were Uriel , who came with one hundred and twenty of his relatives .
Leading Merari’s descendants were Asaiah , who came with two hundred and twenty of his relatives .
Leading Gershom’s descendants were Joel , who came with one hundred and thirty of his relatives .
Leading Elizaphan’s descendants were Shemaiah , who came with two hundred of his relatives .
Leading Hebron’s descendants were Eliel , who came with eighty of his relatives .
Leading Uzziel’s descendants were Amminadab , who came with one hundred and twelve of his relatives .
David called for the priests Zadok and Abiathar and for the Levites Uriel , Asaiah , Joel , Shemaiah , Eliel , and Amminadab .
He said to them : » You are the heads of the Levite families . You and your brothers must perform the ceremonies to make yourselves holy . Then bring the Ark of Jehovah the God of Israel to the place I prepared for it .
» Because you Levites were not there the first time , Jehovah our God struck us . We had not dedicated our lives to serving him in the way he designated . «
So the priests and the Levites made themselves holy in order to move the Ark of Jehovah the God of Israel .
The Levites carried God’s Ark on their shoulders . They used poles as Moses had commanded according to Jehovah’s instructions .
David told the Levite leaders to appoint some of their brothers to serve as musicians . They were expected to play music on harps , lyres , and cymbals to produce joyful music for singing .
So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel , and from his relatives they appointed Asaph Berechiah’s son . From their own relatives , Merari’s descendants , they appointed Ethan son of Kushaiah .
In addition , they appointed their relatives from the second division : Zechariah , Jaaziel , Shemiramoth , Jehiel , Unni , Eliab , Benaiah , Maaseiah , Mattithiah , Eliphelehu , and Mikneiah . Obed Edom and Jeiel were appointed gatekeepers .
The musicians Heman , Asaph , and Ethan were appointed to play bronze cymbals .
Zechariah , Jaziel , Shemiramoth , Jehiel , Unni , Eliab , Maaseiah , and Benaiah were appointed to play harps tuned according to alamoth .
Mattithiah , Eliphelehu , Mikneiah , Obed Edom , Jeiel , and Azaziah were appointed to play lyres and to conduct the eighth .
Chenaniah , a Levite leader , instructed others how to sing prophetic songs because he was skilled at it .
Berechiah and Elkanah were gatekeepers for the ark .
The priests Shebaniah , Joshaphat , Nethanel , Amasai , Zechariah , Benaiah , and Eliezer blew trumpets in front of God’s Ark . Obed Edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark .
Thus David , the leaders of Israel , and the army’s commanders joyfully went to get the Ark of Jehovah’s Covenant from Obed Edom’s house .
Because God helped the Levites who carried the Ark of the Jehovah’s Covenant , they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams .
David was dressed in a fine linen robe , as were all the Levites who carried the Ark , the Levites who were singers , and Chenaniah , the leader of the musicians’ prophetic songs . David also wore a linen ephod .
All Israel brought the Ark of Jehovah’s Covenant with shouts of joy and the sounding of rams’ horns , trumpets , cymbals , harps , and lyres .
When the Ark of Jehovah’s Covenant came to the City of David , Saul’s daughter Michal looked out of a window and saw King David dancing and celebrating , so she despised him .
The men carrying the ark set it inside the tent David had put up for it . They presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings in God’s presence .
When David finished sacrificing burnt offerings and fellowship offerings , he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah .
He also distributed to every person in Israel , both men and women , a loaf of bread , a date cake , and a raisin cake .
David appointed some Levites to serve in front of Jehovah’s Ark by offering prayers , thanks , and praise to Jehovah the God of Israel .
Asaph was the head . Zechariah was second , then Jeiel , Shemiramoth , Jehiel , Mattithiah , Eliab , Benaiah , Obed Edom , and Jeiel with harps and lyres . Asaph played the cymbals .
The priests Benaiah and Jahaziel played trumpets all the time in front of the Ark of God’s covenant .
For the first time David entrusted Asaph and his relatives with the task of singing songs of thanks to Jehovah :
Give thanks to Jehovah . Call on his name . Make known among the nations what he has done .
Sing to him . Make music to praise him . Meditate on all the miracles he has done .
Praise his holy name . Let the hearts of those who seek Jehovah rejoice .
Search for Jehovah and his strength . Always seek his presence .
Remember the miracles he performed . And remember the amazing things he did and the judgments he pronounced .
You are descendants of Israel , his servant . You are descendants of Jacob , his chosen ones .
HE IS JEHOVAH OUR GOD . His judgments are pronounced throughout the earth .
Remember his promise for a very long time , the word that he commanded for a thousand generations !
Remember the covenant that he made to Abraham , and his sworn promise to Isaac .
He confirmed it as a law for Jacob , as a long lasting covenant to Israel .
He said : » I will give you Canaan . It is your share of the inheritance . «
While they were few in number a small group of foreigners lived in that land .
They wandered from nation to nation and from one kingdom to another .
He did not permit anyone to oppress them . He warned kings about them :
» Do not touch my anointed ones or harm my prophets . «
Sing to Jehovah , all the earth ! Day after day announce that Jehovah saves his people .
Tell people about his glory ! Tell all the nations about his miracles .
JEHOVAH IS GREAT ! He should be highly praised . He should be reverenced held in awe respected more than all other gods .
This is because all the gods of the nations are useless idols while Jehovah created the heavens .
Splendor and majesty are in his presence . Strength and joy are where he is .
Appreciate Jehovah’s glory and power you families of the nations . Ascribe to Jehovah glory and strength .
Ascribe to Jehovah the glory his name deserves . Bring an offering , and come to him . Worship Jehovah in his holy splendor .
Tremble in his presence , all the earth ! The earth stands firm . It cannot be moved .
Let the heavens rejoice and the earth be glad . Say to the nations : » JEHOVAH RULES AS KING ! «
Let the sea and everything in it roar like thunder . Let the fields and everything in them rejoice .
Then the trees in the forest will sing with joy in the presence of Jehovah when he comes to judge the earth .
Give thanks to Jehovah because he is good , because his mercy endures forever !
Say : » Rescue us , O God our Salvation . Gather us and save us from the nations that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise . «
Thanks be to Jehovah , God of Israel , from everlasting to everlasting . Then all the people said » amen « and praised Jehovah .
David left Asaph and his relatives to serve continually in front of the Ark of Jehovah’s Covenant , as the daily work required .
David also left Obed Edom and sixty-eight of his relatives to serve there . Obed Edom Jeduthun’s son and Hosah were to be gatekeepers .
David left Zadok and his priestly relatives to serve in Jehovah’s Tent at the place of worship in Gibeon .
They were ordered to sacrifice burnt offerings to Jehovah . This happened on the altar of burnt offerings continually , morning and evening , as written in the Law of Jehovah that he gave Israel .
With Zadok and his relatives were Heman , Jeduthun , and the rest of the Levites who had been selected . They were chosen by name , to give thanks to Jehovah by singing , because His mercy endures forever .
Also , Heman and Jeduthun played trumpets , cymbals , and the other musical instruments that accompany sacred songs . Jeduthun’s sons were stationed at the gate .
Then all the people went home . David went back to bless his family .
David settled in his palace . He said to Nathan the prophet : » Here I am , living in a palace of cedar , while the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah is under a tent . «
Nathan replied to David : » Do what you have in mind , for God is with you . «
That night God spoke to Nathan . He said :
» Go tell my servant David , This is what Jehovah says : ‘ You are not the one to build me a house to dwell in .
» I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought Israel up out of Egypt to this day . I have moved from one tent site to another , from one dwelling place to another .
» In all the places where I have moved with the Israelites , did I ever say to any of their leaders whom I commanded to shepherd my people : Why have you not built me a house of cedar ? «
Therefore , tell my servant David : » This is what Jehovah of Hosts says : ‘ I took you from the pasture and from following the flock , to be ruler over my people Israel .
» ‘ I have been with you wherever you have gone . I have destroyed all your enemies from before you . Now I will make your name like the names of the greatest men of the earth .
» ‘ I will provide a place for my people Israel and will plant them so that they can have a home of their own and no longer be disturbed . Wicked people will not oppress them anymore , as they did at the beginning .
» ‘ They have done this since the time I appointed leaders over my people Israel . I will also subdue all your enemies . I declare to you that Jehovah will build a house for you !
» ‘ When your days are over and you go to be with your fathers , I will raise up your offspring to succeed you . It will be one of your own sons , and I will establish his kingdom .
» ‘ He is the one who will build a house for me . I will establish his throne forever .
» ‘ I will be his father , and he will be my son . I will never take my love away from him , as I took it away from your predecessor .
» ‘ I will set him over my house and my kingdom forever ! His throne will be established forever . ’ «
Nathan reported to David all the words of this entire revelation .
Then King David went in and sat in Jehovah’s presence . He said : » Who am I , O Jehovah ? What is my family , that you have brought me this far ?
» If this were not enough in your sight , O God , you have spoken about the future of the house of your servant . You have looked on me as though I were the most exalted of men , O Jehovah my God .
» What more can David say to you for honoring your servant ? For you know your servant
» Jehovah . For the sake of your servant and according to your will , you have done this great thing and made known all these great promises .
» There is no one like you Jehovah and there is no God but you , as we have heard with our own ears .
» Who is like your people Israel ? Israel is the one nation on earth who’s God went out to redeem a people . You redeemed your people from Egypt . You make a name for yourself , and perform great and awesome wonders by driving out nations from before your people .
» You made your people Israel your very own for a very long time , and you , O Jehovah , have become their God .
» Now , Jehovah , let the promise you have made concerning your servant and his house be established from generation to generation . Do as you promised !
» It will be established and your name will be great forever . Then men will say : » Jehovah of Hosts , the God over Israel , is Israel’s God ! And the house of your servant David will be established before you .
» You , my God , have revealed to your servant that you will build a house for him . So your servant has found courage to pray to you .
» O JEHOVAH , YOU ARE GOD ! You have promised these good things to your servant .
» You have been pleased to bless the house of your servant that it may continue for a very long time in your sight . You Jehovah have blessed it and it will be blessed from generation to generation . «
After this , David defeated and crushed the Philistines . He captured Gath and its surrounding villages from them .
He also defeated Moab , and the Moabites became David’s subjects and paid taxes to him .
David went to establish his control over the territory along the Euphrates River . He defeated King Hadadezer at Hamath .
David took one thousand chariots , seven thousand horsemen , and twenty thousand foot soldiers from him . David also disabled all but one hundred of their horses so that they could not pull chariots .
When the Arameans from Damascus came to help King Hadadezer of Zobah , David killed twenty-two thousand of them .
David stationed troops in the Aramean kingdom of Damascus . The Arameans became his subjects and paid taxes to him . Everywhere David went Jehovah gave him victories .
David took the gold shields that Hadadezer’s servants carried . He brought them to Jerusalem .
David also took a large quantity of bronze from Tibhath and Cun , Hadadezer’s cities . Later Solomon used it to make the pool , pillars , and utensils for the temple .
When King Tou of Hamath heard that David had defeated the whole army of Zobah’s King Hadadezer ,
he sent his son Hadoram to greet King David and congratulate him for fighting and defeating Hadadezer . There had often been war between Hadadezer and Tou .
King David dedicated all the articles of gold , silver , and bronze to Jehovah , along with the silver and gold he had taken from other nations-from Edom , Moab , Ammon , the Philistines , and Amalek .
Zeruiah’s son Abishai killed eighteen thousand Edomites in the Dead Sea region .
He put troops in Edom , and all its people became David’s subjects . Everywhere David went Jehovah gave him victories .

Ahitub’s son Zadok and Abiathar’s son Abimelech were priests . Shavsha was the royal scribe .
Jehoiada’s son Benaiah was commander of the Cherethites and the Pelethites . And David’s sons were his main officials .
In the course of time , Nahash king of the Ammonites died , and his son succeeded him as king .
David thought : » I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash , because his father showed kindness to me . « So David sent a delegation to express his sympathy to Hanun concerning his father . David’s men came to Hanun in the land of the Ammonites to express sympathy to him .
The Ammonite nobles said to Hanun : » Do you think David honors your father by sending men to you to express sympathy ? Or have his men come to you to explore and spy out the country and overthrow it ? «
Therefore Hanun seized David’s men , shaved them , cut off their garments in the middle at the buttocks , and sent them away .
When David was told about the men he sent messengers to meet them , for they were greatly humiliated . The king said : » Stay at Jericho till your beards have grown and then come back . «
The Ammonites realized that they had become a stench in David’s nostrils . Then Hanun and the Ammonites sent seventy-five thousand pounds of silver to hire chariots and charioteers from Aram Naharaim , Northwest Mesopotamia Aram Maacah and Zobah .
They hired thirty-two thousand chariots and charioteers , as well as the king of Maacah with his troops , who came and camped near Medeba , while the Ammonites were mustered from their towns and moved out for battle .
David heard about this and sent Joab out with the entire army of fighting men .
The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance to their city , while the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country .
Joab saw that there were battle lines in front of him and behind him ; so he selected some of the best troops in Israel and deployed them against the Arameans .
He put the rest of the men under the command of Abishai his brother , and they were deployed against the Ammonites .
Joab said : » If the Arameans are too strong for me , then you are to rescue me . But if the Ammonites are too strong for you , then I will rescue you .
» Be strong and let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God . Jehovah will do what is good in his sight . «
Then Joab and the troops with him advanced to fight the Arameans , and they fled before him .
When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans were fleeing , they too fled before his brother Abishai and went inside the city . So Joab went back to Jerusalem .
The Arameans saw that they had been routed by Israel . So they sent messengers and had Arameans brought from beyond the Euphrates River , with Shophach the commander of Hadadezer’s army leading them .
David was told of this , so he gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan . He advanced against them and formed his battle lines opposite them . David formed his lines to meet the Arameans in battle , and they fought against him .
But they fled before Israel , and David killed seven thousand of their charioteers and forty thousand of their foot soldiers . He also killed Shophach the commander of their army .
When the vassals of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel , they made peace with David and became subject to him . So the Arameans were not willing to help the Ammonites anymore .
In the spring , the time when kings go out to battle , Joab led the army to war . They destroyed the Ammonites and came to Rabbah to attack it , while David stayed in Jerusalem . Joab defeated Rabbah and tore it down .
David took the gold crown from the head of Rabbah’s king . It was placed on David’s head . The crown was found to weigh seventy-five pounds , and in it was a precious stone . David also took a lot of goods from the city .
He took the troops who were there and put them to work with saws , hoes , and axes . He did the same to all the Ammonite cities . After that David and all the troops returned to Jerusalem .
War broke out with the Philistines at Gezer . Sibbecai from Hushah killed Sippai , a descendant of Haraphah , and the Philistines were defeated .
When more fighting broke out with the Philistines , Elhanan , son of Jair , killed Lahmi , the brother of Goliath from Gath . The shaft of Lahmi’s spear was like a beam used by weavers .
In another battle at Gath , there was a tall man who had twenty-four fingers and toes : six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot . He also was a descendant of Haraphah .
When he challenged Israel , Jonathan , son of David’s brother Shimea , killed him .
These men were the descendants of Haraphah from Gath . David and his men killed them .
Satan wanted to bring trouble on the people of Israel . He made David decide to take a census .
David gave orders to Joab and the other officers . He said : » Go through Israel , from one end of the country to the other , and count the people . I want to know how many there are . «
Joab answered : » May Jehovah make the people of Israel a hundred times more numerous than they are now ! They are all your servants , Your Majesty . Why do you want to do this and make the whole nation guilty ? «
But the king made Joab obey the order . Joab traveled through the whole country of Israel , and then returned to Jerusalem .
He reported to King David the total number of men capable of military service . There were one million one hundred thousand in Israel and four hundred seventy thousand in Judah .
Because Joab disapproved of the king’s command , he did not take any census of the tribes of Levi and Benjamin .
God was displeased with what had been done , so he punished Israel .
David said to God : » I have committed a terrible sin in doing this ! Please forgive me . I have acted foolishly . «
Jehovah said to Gad , David’s prophet :
» Tell David that I am giving him three choices . I will do whichever he chooses . «
Gad went to David and told him what Jehovah said . He asked : » Which is it to be ?
» Three years of famine ? Three months of running away from the armies of your enemies ? Or : three days in which Jehovah attacks you with his sword and sends an epidemic on your land . He will use his angel to bring death throughout Israel ? What answer shall I give Jehovah ? «
David replied to Gad : » I am in a desperate situation ! But I do not want to be punished by the people . Let Jehovah be the one to punish me , because he is merciful . «
Therefore Jehovah sent an epidemic on the people of Israel , and seventy thousand of them died .
Then God sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem . Then he changed his mind . He said to the angel : » Stop ! That is enough ! « The angel was standing at the threshing place of Araunah , a Jebusite .
David saw the angel standing in midair , holding his sword in his hand , ready to destroy Jerusalem . Then David and the leaders of the people , all of whom were wearing sackcloth bowed low , with their faces touching the ground .
David prayed : » O God , I am the one who did wrong . I am the one who ordered the census . What have these poor people done ? Jehovah , my God , punish my family , and me and spare your people . «
Jehovah’s angel told Gad to command David to go and build an altar to Jehovah at Araunah’s threshing place .
David obeyed Jehovah’s command and did what Gad told him to do .
There at the threshing place Araunah and his four sons were threshing wheat , and when they saw the angel , the sons ran and hid .
Araunah saw King David approaching . He left the threshing place and bowed low with his face touching the ground .
David said to him : » Sell me your threshing place so that I can build an altar to Jehovah , to stop the epidemic . I will give you the full price . «
» Take it , Your Majesty , « Araunah said , » and do whatever you wish . Here are these bulls to burn as an offering on the altar . Here are the threshing boards to use as fuel and wheat to give as an offering . I give it all to you . «
The king answered : » No , I will pay you the full price . I will not give as an offering to Jehovah something that belongs to you , something that costs me nothing . «
He paid Araunah six hundred gold coins for the threshing place .
David built an altar to Jehovah there and offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings . He prayed , and Jehovah answered him by sending fire from heaven to burn the sacrifices on the altar .
Jehovah told the angel to put his sword away , and the angel obeyed .
David saw by this that Jehovah answered his prayer . So he offered sacrifices on the altar at Araunah’s threshing place .
Jehovah’s tent that Moses made in the desert and the altar for burnt offerings were at the worship site at Gibeon .
David could not go there to consult God because the sword of Jehovah’s angel frightened him .
David said : » The house of Jehovah God is to be here , and also the altar of burnt offering for Israel . «
So David gave orders to assemble the foreigners living in Israel . He appointed stonecutters from among them to prepare dressed stone for building the house of God .
He provided a large amount of iron to make nails for the doors of the gateways and for the fittings , and more copper than could be weighed .
He also provided more cedar logs than could be counted . The Sidonians and Tyrians had brought large numbers of them to David .
David said : » My son Solomon is young and inexperienced . The house to be built for Jehovah should be of great magnificence and fame and splendor in the sight of all the nations . Therefore I will make preparations for it . So David made extensive preparations before his death . «
Then he called for his son Solomon and charged him to build a house for Jehovah , the God of Israel .
David said to Solomon : » My son , I had it in my heart to build a house for the Name of Jehovah my God .
» The word of Jehovah came to me , saying : ‘ You have shed much blood and have fought many wars . You are not to build a house for my name . This is because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight .
» ‘ You will have a son who will be a man of peace and rest , and I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side . His name will be Solomon peace , and I will grant Israel peace and quiet during his reign .
» ‘ He is the one who will build a house for my name . He will be my son , and I will be his father . I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for a very ong time . ’ «
» Now , my son , Jehovah is with you , and may you have success and build the house of Jehovah your God , as he said you would .
» May Jehovah give you discretion and understanding when he puts you in command over Israel , so that you may keep the law of Jehovah your God .
» You will have success if you are careful to observe the decrees and laws that Jehovah gave Moses for Israel . Be strong and courageous . Do not be afraid or discouraged .
» I have taken great pains to provide for the temple of Jehovah three thousand seven hundred and fifty tons of gold , about thirty-seven thousand five hundred tons of silver , quantities of copper and iron too great to be weighed , and wood and stone . And you may add to them .
» You have many workmen : stonecutters , masons and carpenters , as well as men skilled in every kind of work
in gold and silver , copper and iron , craftsmen beyond number . Now begin the work , and Jehovah will be with you . «
David ordered all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon .
He said to them : » Is not Jehovah your God with you ? And has he not granted you rest on every side ? For he has handed the inhabitants of the land over to me , and the land is subject to Jehovah and to his people .
» Devote your mind and heart to seek Jehovah your God . Begin to build the sanctuary of Jehovah God . That way you may bring the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah and the sacred articles belonging to God into the Temple that will be built for the name of Jehovah . «
When David was old and full of years , he made his son Solomon king over Israel .
He also gathered all the leaders of Israel , as well as the priests and Levites .
The Levites thirty years old or older were counted , and the total number of men was thirty-eight thousand .
David said : Of these , twenty-four thousand are to supervise the work of Jehovah’s Temple and six thousand are to be officials and judges .
Four thousand are to be gatekeepers and four thousand are to praise Jehovah with musical instruments I have provided for that purpose .
David divided the Levites into groups corresponding to the sons of Levi : Gershon , Kohath and Merari .
Belonging to the Gershonites : Ladan and Shimei .
The sons of Ladan : Jehiel the first , Zetham and Joel , three in all .
The sons of Shimei : Shelomoth , Haziel and Haran , three in all . These were the heads of the families of Ladan .
The sons of Shimei : Jahath , Ziza , Jeush and Beriah . These were the sons of Shimei , four in all .
Jahath was the first and Ziza the second , but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons so they were counted as one family with one assignment .
The sons of Kohath : Amram , Izhar , Hebron and Uzziel , four in all .
The sons of Amram : Aaron and Moses . Aaron was set apart , he and his descendants from generation to generation , to consecrate the most holy things , to offer sacrifices before Jehovah , to minister before him and to pronounce blessings in his name as long as they live .
The sons of Moses the man of God were counted as part of the tribe of Levi .
The sons of Moses : Gershom and Eliezer .
The descendants of Gershom : Shubael was the first .
The descendants of Eliezer : Rehabiah was the first . Eliezer had no other sons , but the sons of Rehabiah were very numerous .
The sons of Izhar : Shelomith was the first .
The sons of Hebron : Jeriah the first , Amariah the second , Jahaziel the third and Jekameam the fourth .
The sons of Uzziel : Micah the first and Isshiah the second .
The sons of Merari : Mahli and Mushi . The sons of Mahli : Eleazar and Kish .
Eleazar died without having sons : he had only daughters . Their cousins , the sons of Kish , married them .
The sons of Mushi : Mahli , Eder and Jerimoth , three in all .
These were the descendants of Levi by their families , the heads of families as they were registered under their names and counted individually , that is , the workers twenty years old or more who served in the Temple of Jehovah .
For David had said : » Since Jehovah , the God of Israel , has granted rest to his people and has come to dwell in Jerusalem from generation to generation ,
the Levites no longer need to carry the Tabernacle or any of the articles used in its service . «
According to the last instructions of David , the Levites were counted from those twenty years old or more .
The duty of the Levites was to help Aaron’s descendants in the service of the Temple of Jehovah : to be in charge of the courtyards , the side rooms , the purification of all sacred things and the performance of other duties at the House of God .
They were in charge of the bread set out on the table , the flour for the grain offerings , the unleavened wafers , the baking and the mixing , and all measurements of quantity and size .
They were also to stand every morning to thank and praise Jehovah . They were to do the same in the evening
and whenever burnt offerings were presented to Jehovah on Sabbaths and at New Moon festivals and at appointed feasts . They were to serve before Jehovah regularly in the proper number and in the way prescribed for them .
So the Levites carried out their responsibilities for the Tent of Meeting , for the Holy Place and , under their brothers the descendants of Aaron , for the service of the Temple of Jehovah .
The divisions of Aaron’s descendants were as follows : Aaron’s sons were Nadab and Abihu , Eleazar and Ithamar .
Nadab and Abihu died before their father died , and neither had any children . So Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests .
David , Eleazar’s descendant Zadok , and Ithamar’s descendant Ahimelech divided Aaron’s descendants into groups for service .
Since Eleazar’s descendants had more men who were family heads than Ithamar’s descendants , they were divided so that Eleazar’s descendants had sixteen family leaders and Ithamar’s descendants had eight family leaders .
Both groups were divided impartially by drawing lots so that there were officers for the holy place and officers for God among both Eleazar’s and Ithamar’s descendants .
The scribe Shemaiah was a son of Nethanel and a descendant of Levi . Shemaiah recorded their names in the presence of the king , the princes , the priest Zadok , Ahimelech son of Abiathar , and the family leaders of the priests and Levites . One family was chosen for Eleazar , another for Ithamar .
The first lot drawn was for Jehoiarib , the second for Jedaiah ,
the third for Harim , the fourth for Seorim ,
the fifth for Malchiah , the sixth for Mijamin ,
the seventh for Hakkoz , the eighth for Abijah ,
the ninth for Jeshua , the tenth for Shecaniah ,
the eleventh for Eliashib , the twelfth for Jakim ,
the thirteenth for Huppah , the fourteenth for Jeshebeab ,
the fifteenth for Bilgah , the sixteenth for Immer ,
the seventeenth for Hezir , the eighteenth for Happizzez ,
the nineteenth for Pethahiah , the twentieth for Jehezkel ,
the twenty-first for Jachin , the twenty-second for Gamul ,
the twenty-third for Delaiah , the twenty-fourth for Maaziah .
These were their priestly groups when they went to serve at Jehovah’s temple . Their ancestor Aaron made these rules for them , as Jehovah God of Israel had commanded him .
The following men were leaders for Levi’s descendants from Kohath : Jehdeiah for Amram’s descendants through Shubael ,
Isshiah for Amram’s descendants through Rehabiah ,
Jahath for Izhar’s descendants through Shelomoth ,
Jeriah for Hebron’s descendants , Amariah the second of Hebron’s descendants , Jahaziel the third of Hebron’s descendants , Jekameam the fourth of Hebron’s descendants ,

and Zechariah for Uzziel’s descendants through Micah’s brother Isshiah .
The following men were leaders from Levi’s descendants from Merari : Mahli , Mushi , and Merari’s son Jaaziah ,
Shoham , Zaccur , and Ibri for Merari’s descendants through his son Jaaziah ,
Eleazar who had no sons , for Mahli’s descendants ,
Jerahmeel for Mahli’s descendants through Kish ,
Mahli , Eder , and Jerimoth for Mushi’s descendants . These were Levi’s descendants according to their families .
They drew lots as their relatives , Aaron’s descendants , had done . They drew them in front of King David , Zadok , Ahimelech , and the leaders of the families of the priests and Levites . The families of the oldest brother were treated the same way as those of the youngest .
David and the commanders of the army set apart for the service some of the sons of Asaph and of Heman and of Jeduthun , who were to prophesy with lyres , harps and cymbals ; and the number of those who performed their service was :
Of the sons of Asaph : Zaccur , Joseph , Nethaniah and Asharelah the sons of Asaph under the direction of Asaph , who prophesied under the direction of the king .
Of Jeduthun , the sons of Jeduthun : Gedaliah , Zeri , Jeshaiah , Shimei , Hashabiah and Mattithiah , six , under the direction of their father Jeduthun with the harp , who prophesied in giving thanks and praising Jehovah .

All these the sons of Heman the king’s seer to exalt him according to the words of God , for God gave fourteen sons and three daughters to Heman .
All these were under the direction of their father to sing in the house of Jehovah , with cymbals , harps and lyres , for the service of the house of God . Asaph , Jeduthun and Heman under the direction of the king .
Their number who were trained in singing to Jehovah , with their relatives , all who were skillful , two hundred eighty-eight .
They cast lots for their duties , all alike , the small as well as the great , the teacher as well as the pupil .

Jeriah had twenty-seven hundred relatives , who were able men and heads of families , and King David put them in charge of the Reubenites , the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh for every matter pertaining to God and for the affairs of the king .
This is a list of Israelite family heads , regiment and battalion commanders , and officers who were serving the king in all the army’s units . Throughout each year they came for a month at a time and then left . Each unit consisted of twenty-four thousand men .

David did not count those less than twenty years old , because Jehovah promised that the people of Israel would be as numerous as the stars in the sky .
Joab , son of Zeruiah , started to count them but did not finish . God was angry with Israel because of this , and the report from it was never included in the official records of King David .

King David stood there and said : » Listen to me relatives brothers and sisters and subjects . I had my heart set on building the Temple where the Ark of Jehovah’s Covenant could be placed . This Temple will be a stool for our God’s feet , and I have made preparations to build it . «
» However God told me : ‘ You must not build the Temple for my name because you have fought wars and caused bloodshed . ’ «
» Yet , from my entire family Jehovah God of Israel chose me to be king of Israel for as long as I live . He had chosen the tribe of Judah to lead Israel . From the families of Judah he chose my father’s family . From among my father’s sons he was pleased to make me king over all Israel .
» Of all my sons , for Jehovah has given me many sons , he has chosen my son Solomon to sit on the throne of Jehovah’s kingdom to rule Israel .
» He told me : ‘ Your son Solomon will build my Temple and my courtyards because I have chosen him to be my son . I will be his father .
» ‘ I will establish his kingdom for a very long time if he will remain determined to obey my commands and laws , as he is doing today . ’ «
» I order you in the sight of Israel , Jehovah’s congregation . And as our God listens dedicate your lives to doing everything Jehovah your God has commanded . Then you will be able to possess this good land and leave it as an inheritance for your descendants .
» You my son Solomon , learn to know your father’s God . Serve Jehovah wholeheartedly and willingly because he searches every heart and understands every thought we have . If you dedicate your life to serving him , he will accept you . On the other hand if you abandon him , he will reject you from then on .
» So be careful , because Jehovah has chosen you to build the Temple as his holy place . Be strong , and do it . «
Then David gave his son Solomon the plans for the entrance hall and the Temple , the storerooms , upper rooms , inner rooms , and the room for the throne of mercy .
He gave him plans for the courtyards of Jehovah’s Temple and for all the rooms around it . These rooms served as treasuries for God’s Temple and the gifts dedicated to God .
He determined the divisions of the priests and Levites . He planned all the work done for worship in Jehovah’s Temple . He designed all the utensils for worship in Jehovah’s Temple .
David specified the weight of gold to be used for each of the utensils for worship ,
the weight of the gold lamp stands and their gold lamps that is , the weight of gold for each lamp stand and its lamps , the weight of silver for each silver lamp stand and its lamps according to the use of each lamp stand for worship ,
the weight of gold for each table with the rows of bread , and the silver for the silver tables ,
the pure gold for the forks , bowls , and pitchers , the weight of each gold bowl , the weight of each silver bowl ,
and the refined gold for the altar of incense . He also gave Solomon the plans for the chariot , that is , the gold angels with their wings spread to cover the Ark of Jehovah’s Covenant .
David said : » All this was written for me by Jehovah’s hand . He made all the details of the plan clear to me . «
David also told his son Solomon : Be strong and courageous , and do the work . Do no be afraid or terrified . Jehovah God , my God , will be with you . He will not abandon you until all the work on Jehovah’s Temple is finished .
Here are the divisions of the priests and Levites for every type of worship in God’s Temple . You have with you every skilled worker to do the work . In addition , all the leaders and people are at your command .
King David announced to the entire assembly : » God has chosen my son Solomon . He is however young and lacks experience . The work to be done is enormous , because this is not a palace for people but a Temple for Jehovah God .
» I have made every effort to prepare materials for the Temple : gold , silver , bronze , iron , timber , precious stones and gems , stones for mosaics , and quantities of marble .
» Over and above all this that I have provided , I have given silver and gold from my personal property because of my love for God’s Temple .
» I have given one hundred and fifteen tons of the finest gold and two hundred and sixty five tons of pure silver for decorating the walls of the Temple
and for all the objects which the skilled workers are to make . Now who else is willing to give a generous offering to Jehovah ? «
Then the heads of the clans , the officials of the tribes , the commanders of the army , and the administrators of the royal property volunteered to give .
They gave the following for the work on the Temple : one hundred and ninety tons of gold , three hundred and eighty tons of silver , six hundred and seventy five tons of bronze , and three thousand seven hundred and fifty tons of iron .
Those who had precious stones gave them to the Temple treasury , which was administered by Jehiel of the Levite clan of Gershon .
The people gave willingly to Jehovah and were happy that so much had been given . King David also was extremely happy .
» There in front of the whole assembly King David praised Jehovah . He said : Jehovah , God of our father ancester Israel . May you be praised forever and ever !
» You are great and powerful , glorious , splendid , and majestic . Everything in heaven and earth is yours , and you , O Jehovah , are king , supreme ruler over all .
» All riches and wealth come from you . You rule everything by your strength and power . You are able to make anyone great and strong .
» Now , our God , we give you thanks , and we praise your glorious name .
» Yet my people and I cannot really give you anything . This is because everything is a gift from you , and we have only given back what is yours already .
» You know , O Jehovah that we pass through life like exiles and strangers , as our ancestors did . Our days are like a passing shadow , and we cannot escape death .
» O Jehovah , our God , we have brought together all this wealth to build a Temple to honor your holy name . It all came from you and all belongs to you .
» I well know , O my God , that you test everyone’s heart and are pleased with people of integrity . In honesty and sincerity I have willingly given all this to you . I have seen how your people who are gathered here have been happy to bring offerings to you .
» Jehovah , God of our ancestors Abraham , Isaac , and Israel , keep such devotion always strong in your people’s hearts and keep them always faithful to you .
» Give my son Solomon a wholehearted desire to obey everything that you command and to build the Temple for which I have made these preparations . «
Then David commanded the people : Praise Jehovah your God ! The entire assembly praised Jehovah , the God of their ancestors . They bowed low and gave honor to Jehovah and also to the king .
The following day they killed animals as sacrifices , dedicating them to Jehovah . Then they gave them to the people to eat . In addition , they sacrificed a thousand bulls , a thousand rams , and a thousand lambs , which they burned whole on the altar . They also brought the offerings of wine .
That day they were very happy as they ate and drank in the presence of Jehovah . For a second time they proclaimed Solomon king . In the name of Jehovah they anointed him as their ruler and Zadok as priest .
So Solomon succeeded his father David on the throne Jehovah had established . He was a successful king , and the whole nation of Israel obeyed him .
All the officials and soldiers , and even all of David’s other sons , promised to be loyal to Solomon as king .
Jehovah made the whole nation stand in awe of Solomon . He made him more glorious than any other king that had ruled Israel .
David son of Jesse ruled over all Israel
for forty years . He ruled in Hebron for seven years and in Jerusalem for thirty-three .
He died at a very old age , wealthy and respected , and his son Solomon succeeded him as king .
The history of King David from beginning to end is recorded in the records of the three prophets , Samuel , Nathan , and Gad .
The records tell how he ruled , how powerful he was , and all the things that happened to him , to Israel , and to the surrounding kingdoms .
Solomon , son of David , strengthened his position over the kingdom . Jehovah , his God , was with him and made him very powerful .
Solomon spoke to all Israel . He spoke to the commanders of regiments and battalions , judges , every prince , and to the heads of Israel’s families .
Then Solomon and the entire assembly went to the place of worship in Gibeon because God’s Tent of Meeting was there . Jehovah’s servant Moses pitched the tent in the desert .
David already brought God’s Ark from Kiriath Jearim to a place he had prepared for it . He pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem .
The copper altar that Bezalel , son of Uri and grandson of Hur built was in front of Jehovah’s Tent . There Solomon and the assembly worshiped Jehovah .
Solomon went to the copper altar in front of the Tent of Meeting and in Jehovah’s presence sacrificed one thousand burnt offerings on it .
That night God appeared to Solomon . He said : » What do you want me to I give you ? «
Solomon answered : » You always showed great love for my father David . Now you have allowed me to succeed him as king .
» O Jehovah my God , fulfill the promise you made to my father David . You have made me king over a people , who are so many that they cannot be counted .
» Please give me the wisdom and knowledge I need to rule over them . Otherwise , how would I ever be able to rule this great people of yours ? «
God replied to Solomon : » You have made the right choice . Instead of asking for wealth , treasure , fame or the death of your enemies or even for long life for yourself , you have asked for wisdom and knowledge so that you can rule my people , over whom I have made you king .
» For this reason I will give you wisdom and knowledge . And in addition , I will give you more wealth , treasure , and fame than any king has ever had before or will ever have again . «
So Solomon left the place of worship at Gibeon , where the Tent of Jehovah’s presence was , and returned to Jerusalem . There he ruled over Israel .
Solomon assembled a force of fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand cavalry horses . Some of them he kept in Jerusalem . The rest he stationed in various other cities .
During his reign silver and gold became as common in Jerusalem as stone , and cedar was as plentiful as ordinary sycamore in the foothills of Judah .
Solomon’s merchants bought his string of horses and chariots in the regions of Musri and Kue .
They imported each chariot from Egypt for fifteen pounds of silver and each horse for six ounces of silver . For the same price they obtained horses to export to all the Hittite and Syrian kings .
Solomon gave orders to begin building the Temple for Jehovah’s name and a royal palace for himself .
He drafted seventy thousand men to carry heavy loads , eighty thousand to quarry stones in the mountains , and three thousand six hundred foremen .
Solomon sent a message to King Hiram of Tyre : » Do business with me as you did with my father , King David , when you sold him cedar logs for building his palace .
» I am building a Temple to honor Jehovah my God . It will be a holy place where my people and I will worship him by burning incense of fragrant spices . We will present offerings of sacred bread to him continuously , and we will offer burnt offerings every morning and evening , as well as on Sabbaths , New Moon Festivals , and other holy days honoring Jehovah our God . He has commanded Israel to do this from generation to generation .
» I am determined to build a great Temple . This is because our God is greater than all other gods .
» No one can really build a Temple for God . This is because even all the vastness of heaven cannot contain him . How then can I build a Temple that would be anything more than a place to burn incense to God ?
» Send me a man with skill in engraving , in working gold , silver , copper , and iron , and in making blue , purple , and red cloth . He will work with the craftsmen of Judah and Jerusalem whom my father David selected .
» I know how skillful your lumbermen are , so send me cedar , cypress , and juniper logs from Lebanon . I am ready to send my men to assist yours .
» Prepare large quantities of timber , because this Temple I intend to build will be large and magnificent .
» As provisions for your lumbermen , I will send you one hundred thousand bushels of wheat , one hundred thousand bushels of barley , one hundred and ten thousand gallons of wine , and one hundred and ten thousand gallons of olive oil . «
King Hiram sent Solomon a letter in reply . He wrote : » Jehovah made you their king because he loves his people . «
» Praise Jehovah the God of Israel , Creator of heaven and earth ! He has given King David a wise son , full of understanding and skill . He now plans to build a Temple for Jehovah and a palace for himself .
» I am sending you a wise and skillful master metalworker named Huram Hiram-abi .
» He was the son of a woman from the tribe of Dan . His father is a native of Tyre . Huram knows how to work with gold , silver , copper , iron , stone , wood , purple , violet , and dark red cloth , and linen . He also knows how to make all kinds of engravings and follow any set of plans that will be given to him . He can work with your skilled workmen and the skilled workmen of His Majesty David , your father .
» Your Majesty may now send the wheat , barley , olive oil , and wine he promised the workers .
» We will cut all the trees for lumber you need in Lebanon . Then we will make rafts out of it and send them to you in Joppa by sea . You can take it from there to Jerusalem . «
Solomon counted all the men who were foreigners in the land of Israel , as his father David had counted them . Solomon counted one hundred and fifty-three thousand and six hundred foreigners .
He directed seventy thousand of them carry heavy loads , eighty thousand of them quarry stone in the mountains , and three thousand six hundred of them supervise the work as foremen .
Solomon began to build Jehovah’s Temple in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah . That is where Jehovah appeared to his father David . David had prepared the site on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite .
He began to build on the second day in the second month of the fourth year of his reign . It was in the place David had povided .
This is how Solomon laid the foundation to build God’s Temple . It was ninety feet long and thirty feet wide . They used the old standard measurement .
The entrance hall in front of the main room was thirty feet wide the same as the width of the temple and thirty feet high . He covered its inside walls with pure gold .
He paneled the larger building with cypress . Then he overlaid it with fine gold . It was decorated with designs in the form of palm trees and chains .
He covered the building with gems to beautify it and used gold from Parvaim .
He also overlaid the building , the rafters , the threshold , the walls , and the doors with gold . He carved cherubim angels on the walls .
He made the most holy place . It was as long as the Temple was wide , thirty feet long . It was also thirty feet wide . He overlaid it with forty-five thousand pounds of fine gold .
The gold nails weighed twenty ounces . He also overlaid the upper rooms with gold .
In the most holy place he made two sculptured cherubim angels and covered them with gold .
The combined length of the cherubim wings was thirty feet . A wing of one of the cherub was seven and one half feet long and touched the wall of the building . Its other wing was seven and one half feet long and touched one wing of the other cherub .
The wing of the other one of the cherub angels was seven and one half feet long and touched the other wall of the building . Its other wing was seven and one half feet long and touched the wing of the first cherub . So the cherubs’ combined wingspan was thirty feet .
They stood on their feet facing the main hall .
Solomon made the canopy of violet , purple , and dark red cloth and of linen and decorated it with cherubim .
He made two pillars for the front of the Temple . They were fifty-three feet long , and the crown on each pillar was seven and one half feet high .
He made chains for the inner room and also put them on the crowns . He made one hundred pomegranates and put them on the chains .
He set up the pillars in front of the Temple , one on the right and the other on the left . He named the one on the right Jachin He Establishes and the one on the left Boaz In Him Is Strength .
King Solomon had a copper altar built . It was thirty feet square and fifteen feet high .
He also made a round tank molten sea of copper . It was seven and one half feet deep , fifteen feet in diameter , and forty-five feet in circumference .
All around the outer edge of the rim of the tank were two rows of decorations , one above the other . The decorations were in the shape of bulls . They had been cast all in one piece with the rest of the tank .
The tank rested on the backs of twelve copper bulls that faced outward . Three faced in each direction , north , west , south and east .
The sides of the tank were three inches thick . Its rim was like the rim of a cup , curving outward like the petals of a flower . The tank held about fifteen thousand gallons .
They also made ten basins , five to be placed on the south side of the Temple and five on the north side . They were to be used to rinse the parts of the animals that were burned as sacrifices . The water in the large tank was for the priests to use for washing .
They made ten gold lamp stands according to the usual pattern , and ten tables , and placed them in the main room of the Temple .
He made ten tables and put them in the temple . Five were on the south side and five on the north side . And he made one hundred gold bowls .
He also made the priests’ courtyard and the large courtyard and its doors . He covered the doors with copper .
He set the pool on the south side in the southeast corner .
Huram also made the pots , shovels , and bowls . So Huram finished the work for King Solomon in God’s Temple :
Two pillars , bowl-shaped crowns on top of the two pillars , and two sets of filigree to cover the two bowl-shaped crowns on top of the pillars ,
four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of filigree two rows of pomegranates for each filigree to cover the two bowl-shaped crowns on the pillars ,
ten stands and ten basins on the stands ,
one pool and the twelve bulls under it ,
pots , shovels , and three-pronged forks . Huram Hiram-abiv made all of them out of polished copper for Jehovah’s Temple at King Solomon’s request .
The king cast them in foundries in the Jordan Valley between Succoth and Zeredah .
Solomon made so many of these products that no one tried to determine how much the copper weighed .
Solomon made all the furnishings for God’s Temple : the gold altar , the gold tables on which the bread of the presence was placed ,
lamp stands and lamps of pure gold to burn as directed in front of the inner room ,
flowers , lamps , pure gold tongs ,
snuffers , basins , dishes , incense burners of pure gold , the gold entrance to the temple , the gold doors of the most holy place , and the gold doors of the Temple .
The work Solomon did on Jehovah’s Temple was finished . He brought the holy things that had belonged to his father David , the silver , gold , and all the utensils . He put them in the storerooms of God’s Temple .
Then Solomon assembled the respected leaders of Israel , all the heads of the tribes , and the leaders of the Israelite families . They came to Jerusalem to take the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah from the City of David , which is Zion .
The men of Israel gathered around the king at the Festival of Booths in the seventh month .
When all the leaders of Israel had arrived , the Levites picked up the ark .
They brought the Ark , the Tent of Meeting , and all the holy utensils in it to the Temple . The priests and the Levites carried them
while King Solomon and the whole assembly from Israel were offering countless sheep and cattle sacrifices in front of the Ark .
The priests brought Jehovah’s Ark of the Covenant to its place in the inner room of the Temple , the most holy place , under the wings of the cherubim angels .
The cherubim angels outstretched wings were over the place where the Ark rested so that the cherubim became a covering above the Ark and its poles .
The poles were so long that their ends could be seen in the holy place by anyone standing in front of the inner room . However they could not be seen outside . They are still there today .
There was nothing in the Ark except the two tablets Moses placed there at Horeb , where Jehovah made a covenant with the Israelites after they left Egypt .
All the priests who were present had performed the ceremonies to make themselves holy to God without regard to staying in their divisions .
All the Levites who were musicians : Asaph , Heman , Jeduthun , their sons , and their relatives were dressed in fine linen and stood east of the altar with cymbals , harps , and lyres . With the musicians were one hundred and twenty priests blowing trumpets . When the priests left the holy place ,
the trumpeters and singers praised and thanked Jehovah in unison . Accompanied by trumpets , cymbals , and other musical instruments , they sang in praise to Jehovah : » He is good ; his mercy lovingkindness endures forever . « Then Jehovah’s Temple was filled with a cloud .
The priests could not serve because of the cloud . Jehovah’s glory filled the Temple of God .
Then Solomon proclaimed : » Jehovah said he would live in a dark cloud .
» But I have built you a high Temple . It is a home for you to live in permanently . «
Then the king turned around and blessed the entire assembly from Israel while they were standing .
» Thanks be to Jehovah God of Israel . With his mouth he made a promise to my father David . With his hand he carried it out . « He said :
» Since I brought my people Israel out of Egypt , I did not choose any city from the tribes of Israel as a place to build a Temple for my name . And I did not choose any man to be prince over my people Israel .
» Now I have chosen Jerusalem to be a place for my name . I have chosen David to rule my people Israel .
» My father David had his heart set on building a Temple for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel .
» However , Jehovah said to my father David : Since you had your heart set on building a Temple for my name , your intentions were good .
» You must not build the Temple . Instead , your own son will build the Temple for my name .
» Jehovah has kept the promise he made . I have taken my father David’s place . I sit on the throne of Israel as Jehovah promised . I have built the Temple for the name of Jehovah God of Israel .
» I put the Ark that contains Jehovah’s promise to Israel there . «
In the presence of the entire assembly of Israel , Solomon stood in front of Jehovah’s altar . He stretched out his hands to pray .
Solomon had made a copper platform seven and one half feet long , seven and one half feet wide , and four and one half feet high . He put it in the middle of the courtyard . He stood on the platform , knelt in front of the entire assembly , and stretched out his hands toward heaven .
He said : » Jehovah God of Israel , there is no god like you in heaven or on earth . You keep your promise of mercy to your servants , who obey you wholeheartedly .
» You have kept your promise to my father David , your servant . With your mouth you promised it . With your hand you carried it out as it is today .
» Now then , O Jehovah , God of Israel , keep your promise to my father David , your servant . You said : You will never fail to have an heir sitting in front of me on the throne of Israel if your descendants are faithful to me as you have been faithful to me .
» Therefore , Jehovah , God of Israel , may the promise you made to David , your servant , come true .
» Does God really live on earth with people ? If heaven and the highest heaven cannot hold you , then how can this Temple that I have built ?
» Nevertheless , O Jehovah my God , please pay attention to my prayer for mercy . Listen to my cry for help as I pray to you .
» Day and night may your eyes be on this Temple , the place where you said your name will be . Listen to me as I pray toward this place .
» Hear the plea for mercy that your people Israel and I pray toward this place . Hear us in heaven , the place where you live . Hear and forgive .
» If anyone sins against another person and is required to take an oath and comes to take the oath in front of your altar in this temple ,
then hear that person in heaven , take action , and make a decision . Repay the guilty person with the proper punishment , but declare the innocent person innocent .
» An enemy may defeat your people Israel because they have sinned against you . But when your people return , praise your name , pray , and plead with you in this Temple ,
then hear them in heaven , forgive the sins of your people Israel , and bring them back to the land that you gave to them and their ancestors .
» When the sky is shut and there is no rain because they are sinning against you and they pray toward this place , praise your name , and turn away from their sin because you made them suffer ,
then hear them in heaven . Forgive the sins of your servants , your people Israel . Teach them the proper way to live . Then send rain on the land , which you gave to your people as an inheritance .
» There may be famine in the land . Plant diseases , heat waves , funguses , locusts , or grasshoppers may destroy crops . Enemies may blockade Israel’s city gates . During every plague or sickness
hear every prayer for mercy made by one person or by all the people in Israel , all who know suffering or pain , who stretch out their hands toward this Temple .
» Hear them in heaven , where you live . Forgive them and give people the proper reply . You know what is in their hearts , because you alone can read hearts .
as long as they live in the land that you gave to our ancestors , they will reverence you and follow you .
» People who are not Israelites will come from distant countries because of your great name , mighty hand , and powerful arm . When they come to pray facing this Temple ,
then hear them in heaven , the place where you live . Do everything they ask so that all the people of the world may know your name and respect you like your people Israel and learn that this Temple that I built bears your name .
» When your people go to war against their enemies , you send them and they pray to you toward this city you have chosen and the Temple I built for your name ,
then hear their prayer for mercy in heaven , and do what is right for them .
» They may sin against you . There is no man who is without sin . You may become angry with them and hand them over to an enemy who takes them to another country as captives , whether it is far or near .
» If they come to their senses , are sorry for what they ’ ve done , and plead with you in the land where they are captives , saying : We have sinned . We have done wrong . We have been wicked .
» If they change their attitude toward you in the land where they are captives . If they pray to you toward the land that you gave their ancestors , and the city you have chosen , and the Temple I have built for your name ,
then in heaven , the place where you live , hear their prayer for mercy . Do what is right for them . Forgive your people , who have sinned against you .
» Finally , my God , may your eyes be open and your ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place .
» Now arise , and come to your resting place , Jehovah our God , you and the ark of your power . Clothe your priests , Jehovah God , with salvation . Let your godly ones rejoice in what is good .
» O Jehovah our God , do not reject your anointed one . Remember your mercy to your servant David ! «
When Solomon finished praying , fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offerings and the other sacrifices , and Jehovah’s glory filled the Temple .
The priests could not go into Jehovah’s Temple because Jehovah’s glory had filled it .
When all the Israelites saw the fire come down and Jehovah’s glory on the Temple , they knelt down with their faces on the pavement . They worshiped and praised Jehovah . They said : » He is good ; his mercy lovingkindness endures forever . «
Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices to Jehovah .
King Solomon offered twenty-two thousand cattle and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep as sacrifices to Jehovah . Thus the king and all the people dedicated God’s Temple .
The priests were standing at their posts . So were the Levites who had Jehovah’s musical instruments that King David made for praising Jehovah . They were saying : » his mercy endures forever . « This he used to offer praise . The priests were opposite the Levites blowing trumpets while all Israel was standing there .
Solomon designated the courtyard in front of Jehovah’s Temple as a holy place . He sacrificed the burnt offerings , grain offerings , and the fat because the copper altar that he had made and that was in front of Jehovah was not able to hold all of them .
Then Solomon and all Israel celebrated the Festival of Booths . A very large crowd came from the territory between the border of Hamath and the River of Egypt .
There was an assembly on the eighth day . They observed the dedication of the altar for seven days and celebrated the festival for another seven days .
Solomon dismissed the people to their tents on the twenty-third day of the seventh month . They rejoiced with cheerful hearts for all the blessings Jehovah had given David , Solomon , and his people Israel .
Solomon finished Jehovah’s Temple and the royal palace and completed everything he had in mind for Jehovah’s Temple and his own palace .
JEHOVAH APPEARED TO SOLOMON THAT NIGHT . He said to Solomon : » I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a Temple for sacrifices .
» I may shut the sky so that there is no rain , or command grasshoppers to devour the countryside , or send an epidemic among my people .
» However , if my people , who are called by my name , will humble themselves , pray , search for me , and turn from their evil ways , I will hear their prayer from heaven , forgive their sins , and heal their country .
» My eyes will be open ! My ears will pay attention to the prayers offered at this place .
» I have chosen and declared this Temple holy so that my name may be placed there forever . My eyes and my heart will always be there .
» If you will be faithful to me as your father David was , do everything I command , and obey my laws and rules ,
» I will establish your royal dynasty just as I said in a promise to your father David , when I said : ‘ You will never fail to have an heir ruling over Israel . ’ «
» On the other hand , if you and your descendants turn away from me and abandon my commandments and laws that I gave you , and follow and serve other gods and worship them ,
» I will uproot Israel from the land I gave them . I will reject this Temple that I declared holy for my name . I will make it an example and an object of ridicule for all the people of the world .
» Everyone passing by this impressive Temple will be appalled . They will ask : Why did Jehovah do these things to this land and to this Temple ?
» They will answer their own question : ‘ They abandoned Jehovah the God of their ancestors , who brought them out of Egypt . They adopted other gods , worshiped , and served them . That is why he brought this disaster on them . ’ «
It took Solomon twenty years to build Jehovah’s house and his own house .
He rebuilt the cities Huram gave him . He had Israelites live in them .
Solomon attacked Hamath Zobah and conquered it .
He rebuilt Tadmor in the desert and built all the storage cities in Hamath .
He also rebuilt Upper Beth Horon and Lower Beth Horon into cities fortified with walls , double-door gates , and bars .
He also rebuilt Baalath and all the storage cities that he owned . He built all the cities for his chariots , all the cities for his warhorses , and whatever else he wanted to build in Jerusalem , Lebanon , or the entire territory that he governed .
The Hittites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites had been left in the land because the Israelites had not been able to destroy them . They were not Israelites .
They had descendants who were still in the land . Solomon drafted them for slave labor . They are still Israel’s slaves today .
Solomon did not make any of the Israelites slaves for his projects . Instead , they were the soldiers , officers , generals , and commanders of his chariot and cavalry units .
These were the officers in charge of King Solomon’s projects : two hundred and fifty foremen for the people who did the work .
Then Solomon brought Pharaoh’s daughter up from the city of David to the house he had built for her . He said : » My wife must not dwell in the house of David king of Israel , because the places are holy where the Ark of Jehovah’s Covenant has entered . «
Solomon offered burnt offerings to Jehovah on the altar of Jehovah he had built before the porch .
He did so according to the daily rule , offering them up according to the commandment of Moses , for the Sabbaths , the new moons and the three annual feasts , the Feast of Unleavened Bread , the Feast of Weeks and the Feast of Booths .
As Solomon’s father David had directed , he set up the divisions of priests for their service and the divisions of Levites for their appointed places . The Levites were to lead in praising Jehovah and to serve beside the priests by doing whatever needed to be done each day . Solomon also set up divisions of doorkeepers at every gate because this was what David , the man of God , had commanded .
No one neglected the king’s orders to the priests or the Levites in any matter , including the Temple’s finances .
All of Solomon’s work was carried out from the day the foundation of Jehovah’s Temple was laid until it was completed . Jehovah’s Temple was now complete .
Then Solomon went to the coast near Ezion Geber and Elath in Edom .
Huram sent his own servants and his experienced sailors with ships to Solomon . They went with Solomon’s servants to Ophir . There they procured thirty three thousand seven hundred and fifty pounds of gold , and brought it to King Solomon .
The QUEEN OF SHEBA heard about Solomon’s reputation . So she came to Jerusalem to test him with difficult questions . She arrived with a large group of servants . They had camels carrying spices , a large quantity of gold , and precious stones . When she came to Solomon , she talked with him about everything she had on her mind .
Solomon answered all her questions . No question was too difficult for Solomon to answer .
When the queen of Sheba saw Solomon’s wisdom , the palace he built ,
the food on his table , his officers’ seating arrangement , the organization of his officials and the uniforms they wore , his cupbearers and their uniforms , and the burnt offerings that he sacrificed at Jehovah’s Temple , she was breathless .
She told the king : » What I heard in my country about your words and your wisdom is true !
» I did not believe the reports until I came and saw it with my own eyes . I was not even told about half of the extent of your wisdom . You have surpassed the stories I heard .
» Your men are indeed blessed ! Your servants are truly blessed . It is because they are always stationed near you and listen to your wisdom !
» I thank Jehovah your God , who is pleased with you . He has put you on his throne to be king on behalf of Jehovah your God . Because of your God’s love for the people of Israel , he has established them permanently and made you king over them so that you would maintain justice and righteousness . «
The queen gave the king nine thousand pounds of gold , a very large quantity of spices , and precious stones . Never was there such a large quantity of spices in Israel as those that the queen of Sheba gave King Solomon .
Huram’s servants and Solomon’s servants who brought gold from Ophir also brought sandalwood and precious stones .
With the sandalwood the king made gateways to Jehovah’s Temple and the royal palace . They also made lyres and harps for the singers . No one had ever seen anything like them in Judah .
King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba anything she wanted . Whatever she asked for , more than what she had brought him . Then she and her servants went back to her country .
The gold that came to Solomon in one year weighed forty nine thousand nine hundred and fifty pounds ,
not counting the gold that the merchants and traders brought . All the Arab kings and governors of the land also brought gold and silver to Solomon .
King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold , using fifteen pounds of gold on each shield .
He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold , using seven and one half pounds of gold on each shield . The king put them in the hall named the Forest of Lebanon .
King Solomon also made a large ivory throne and covered it with pure gold .
Six steps led to the throne . It had a gold footstool attached to it . There were armrests on both sides of the seat . Two lions stood beside the armrests .
Twelve lions stood on six steps , one on each side . Nothing like this had been made for any other kingdom .
All King Solomon’s cups were gold . All the utensils for the hall named the Forest of Lebanon were fine gold . Silver was not considered valuable in Solomon’s time .
The king had ships going to Tarshish with Huram’s sailors . Once every three years the Tarshish ships would bring gold , silver , ivory , apes , and monkeys .
King Solomon was greater in wealth and wisdom than all the other kings of the world .
All the kings of the world wanted to listen to the wisdom that God gave Solomon .
Everyone who came brought him gifts such as articles of silver and gold , clothing , weapons , spices , horses , and mules . This happened year after year .
Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots , and twelve thousand war horses . He stationed some in chariot cities and others with himself in Jerusalem .
He ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates River to the country of the Philistines and as far as the Egyptian border .
The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones . He made cedars as plentiful as fig trees in the foothills .
Horses were imported for Solomon from Egypt and from all other countries .
The rest of the acts of Solomon from first to last are written in the records of Nathan the prophet , in the prophecy of Ahijah from Shiloh , and in Iddo the seer’s visions about Jeroboam son of Nebat .
Solomon ruled in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years .
Solomon lay down in death with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David . His son Rehoboam succeeded him as king .
Rehoboam went to Shechem because all Israel had gone to Shechem to make him king .
Jeroboam , Nebat’s son , was still in Egypt , where he had fled from King Solomon . When he heard about Rehoboam , he returned from Egypt .
Israel sent for Jeroboam and invited him back . Jeroboam and all Israel went to speak to Rehoboam . They said :
» Your father made us carry a heavy burden . Reduce the hard work and lighten the heavy burden he put on us . We will serve you . «
He said to them : » Come back the day after tomorrow . « So the people left .
King Rehoboam sought advice from the elders who had served his father Solomon while he was still alive . He asked : » What do you advise ? How should I respond to these people ? «
They told him : » If you are good to these people and try to please them by speaking gently to them , then they will always be your servants . «
He ignored the advice the elders gave him . He sought advice from the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him .
He asked : » What is your advice ? How should we respond to these people who are asking me to lighten the burden my father put on them ? «
The young men who had grown up with him answered : » This is what you should tell them : ‘ My little finger is heavier than my father’s whole body .
» ‘ If my father put a heavy burden on you , I will add to it . If my father punished you with whips , I will punish you with scorpions . ’ «
So Jeroboam and all the people came back to Rehoboam two days later , as the king had instructed them .
The king answered them harshly . He ignored the elder’s advice .
He spoke to them as the young men advised . He said : » If my father made your burden heavy , I will add to it . If my father punished you with whips , I will use scorpions . «
The king refused to listen to the people because Jehovah was directing these events to carry out the promise he had made to Jeroboam , Nebat’s son through Ahijah from Shiloh .
When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them , the people answered the king : » What share do we have in David’s kingdom ? We will not receive an inheritance from Jesse’s son . Everyone to his own tent , Israel ! Now look after your own house , David ! « So all Israel went home to their tents .
Rehoboam ruled the Israelites who lived in the cities of Judah .
King Rehoboam sent Hadoram to the Israelites . He was in charge of forced labor , but they stoned him to death . So King Rehoboam got on his chariot as fast as he could and fled to Jerusalem .
Israel has rebelled against David’s dynasty to this day .
Rehoboam came to Jerusalem and gathered the people of Judah and Benjamin . There were one hundred and eighty thousand of the best soldiers , to fight against Israel and return the kingdom to Rehoboam .
God spoke his word to Shemaiah , the man of God . He said :
» Speak to Judah’s King Rehoboam , son of Solomon , and all Israel in Judah and Benjamin . «
Jehovah says : » Do not wage war against your relatives . Everyone , go home . What has happened is my doing . « So they obeyed the word of Jehovah . They turned back from their attack on Jeroboam .
Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem . He built fortified cities in Judah .
He rebuilt Bethlehem , Etam , Tekoa ,
Beth Zur , Soco , Adullam ,
Gath , Mareshah , Ziph ,
Adoraim , Lachish , Azekah ,
Zorah , Aijalon , and Hebron . These were fortified cities in Judah and Benjamin .
He strengthened the cities and put army officers with reserves of food , olive oil , and wine in them .
He stored shields and spears in each city . He made the cities very secure . Rehoboam held on to Judah and Benjamin .
The priests and Levites in every region of Israel aligned with Rehoboam .
The priests abandoned their land and property and went to Judah and Jerusalem because Jeroboam and his descendants rejected them as Jehovah’s priests .
As an alternative , Jeroboam appointed his own priests for the illegal worship sites and the goat and calf statues he had made as idols .
People from every tribe of Israel who were determined to seek Jehovah the true God of Israel followed the Levitical priests to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Jehovah God of their ancestors .
So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah by supporting Rehoboam , son of Solomon , for three years . During those three years they lived the way David and Solomon had lived .
Rehoboam married Mahalath , daughter of Jerimoth . Jerimoth was the son of David and Abihail . Abihail was the daughter of Eliab , son of Jesse .
Mahalath gave birth to the following sons : Jeush , Shemariah , and Zaham .
After marrying Mahalath , he married Maacah , Absalom’s granddaughter . She gave birth to Abijah , Attai , Ziza , and Shelomith .
Rehoboam loved Maacah , Absalom’s granddaughter , more than all his other wives and concubines . He had eighteen wives and sixty concubines . He fathered twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters .
Rehoboam appointed Abijah , son of Maacah , as family head and prince among his brothers . By doing this , Rehoboam could make him king .
He wisely placed his sons in every region of Judah and Benjamin , in every fortified city . He gave them allowances and obtained many wives for them .
Rehoboam established his kingdom and made himself strong . He and all Israel abandoned Jehovah’s teachings .
King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem . This took place in the fifth year of Rehoboam’s reign . It happened because all Israel was not loyal to Jehovah .
Shishak had twelve hundred chariots , sixty thousand horses , and an army of countless Libyans , Sukkites , and Sudanese from Egypt .
He captured the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem .
Shemaiah the prophet approached Rehoboam and the princes of Judah who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak . He said to them : » Jehovah says : ‘ You have forsaken me , so I also have forsaken you to Shishak . ’ «
Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said : » Jehovah is righteous . «
Jehovah saw that they humbled themselves . The word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah . He said : » They have humbled themselves . I will not destroy them . I will grant them deliverance . I will not use Shishak to pour out my anger on Jerusalem .
» However , they will become his servants . They must learn the difference between serving me and serving foreign kings . «
King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem and took away the treasures from Jehovah’s temple and the royal palace . He took them all ! He even took the gold shields Solomon had made .
As a result King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them . He put them by the entrance to the royal palace , where the captains of the guards were stationed .
When the king went into Jehovah’s Temple , guards carried the shields and then returned them to the guardroom .
When Rehoboam humbled himself , the anger of Jehovah turned from him . He did not completely destroy him . So things went well in Judah . «
King Rehoboam strengthened his position in Jerusalem and ruled . He was forty-one years old when he began to rule . He ruled for seventeen years in Jerusalem , the city that Jehovah chose from all the tribes of Israel , and the city where Jehovah put his name . Rehoboam’s mother was an Ammonite woman named Naamah .
He did evil because he did not seriously dedicate his life to Jehovah .
The events concerning Rehoboam from first to last are written in the records of the prophet Shemaiah and the records of the seer Iddo in the genealogies ? There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam as long as they lived .
Rehoboam lay down in death with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David . His son Abijah succeeded him as king .
Abijah became king of Judah in Jeroboam’s eighteenth year as king of Israel .
His mother was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel from Gibeah . He ruled from Jerusalem for three years when war broke out between Abijah of Judah and Jeroboam of Israel .
Abijah raised an army of four hundred thousand soldiers . Jeroboam opposed him with an army of eight hundred thousand soldiers .
The armies met in the hill country of Ephraim . King Abijah went up Mount Zemaraim and called out to Jeroboam and the Israelites : » Listen to me ! « He shouted .
» Do you not know that Jehovah , the God of Israel , made an unbreakable covenant with David , giving him and his descendants kingship over Israel from generation to generation ?
» Jeroboam son of Nebat rebelled against Solomon , his king .
» Later he organized a group of worthless scoundrels . They forced their will on Rehoboam son of Solomon , who was too young and inexperienced to resist them .
» Now you plan to fight against the royal authority Jehovah gave to David’s descendants . You have a huge army ! You have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made to be your gods .
» You drove out Jehovah’s priests ! You evicted the descendants of Aaron and the Levites . In their place you appointed priests in the same way that other nations do . Anybody who comes along with a bull or seven sheep can get himself consecrated as a priest of those so-called gods of yours .
» We still serve Jehovah our God ! We have not abandoned him . Priests descended from Aaron perform their duties , and Levites assist them .
» Every morning and every evening they offer him incense and animal sacrifices burned whole . They present the offerings of bread on a table that is ritually clean , and every evening they light the lamps on the gold lamp stand . We do what Jehovah has commanded ! But you have abandoned him !
» God is with us as our leader . His priests will sound their trumpets to call the army to fight you . Men of Israel do not wage war against Jehovah the God of your ancestors . You will not succeed . «
Jeroboam set an ambush to attack them from behind . So Jeroboam’s army was in front of Judah , and the ambush was behind them .
Judah’s soldiers looked around and found the battle was in front of them and behind them . They cried out to Jehovah ! The priests blew the trumpets ,
The men of Judah shouted ! When they shouted God attacked Jeroboam and all Israel in front of Abijah and Judah .
The Israelites fled from Judah’s army . God handed them over to Judah .
Abijah and his men defeated them decisively . Five hundred thousand of the best men of Israel were killed .
The Israelites were humbled at that time . The people of Judah won because they trusted Jehovah God of their ancestors .
Abijah pursued Jeroboam and captured some of his cities : Bethel and its villages , Jeshanah and its villages , and Ephron and its villages .
Jeroboam never regained power during Abijah’s time . Jehovah caused Jeroboam to become sick , and Jeroboam died .
Abijah became strong . He married fourteen wives and fathered twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters .
The history of Abijah , including how he lived , is written by the prophet Iddo .
Abijah slept in death with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David . His son Asa succeeded him as king . In Asa’s time the land had peace for ten years .
Asa did what Jehovah his God considered good and right .
He got rid of the altars of foreign gods . He broke down the sacred stones . He cut down the poles dedicated to the goddess Asherah .
He told the people of Judah to dedicate their lives to Jehovah . They were to serve the God of their ancestors and observe obey his teachings and commandments .
He got rid of the illegal places of worship and destroyed the altars for incense in all the cities of Judah . The kingdom was at peace during his reign .
He built fortified cities in Judah and the land had peace . There was no war during those years because Jehovah gave him a time of peace .
Asa told Judah : » Let us build these cities and make walls around them with towers and doors that can be barred . The country is still ours because we have dedicated our lives to serve Jehovah our God . We have dedicated our lives to him . He has surrounded us with peace . « So they built the cities , and everything went well .
Asa had an army of three hundred thousand Judeans who were armed with large shields and spears and two hundred and eighty thousand Benjaminites who were armed with small shields and bows . All of these men were strong fighting men .
Zerah from Ethiopia led an army of a million soldiers and three hundred chariots to the town of Mareshah in Judah .
Asa met him there . The two armies prepared for battle in Zephathah Valley near Mareshah .
Asa prayed : » Jehovah , only you can help a powerless army defeat a stronger one . We depend on you to help us . We will fight against this powerful army to honor your name ! We know that you will not be defeated . You are Jehovah our God . Do not let man prevail against you . «
Jehovah helped Asa and his army defeat the Ethiopians . The enemy soldiers ran away ,
Asa and his army pursued them as far as Gerar . It was a total defeat ! The Ethiopians could not even fight back ! The soldiers from Judah took everything that had belonged to the Ethiopians .
Asa and his army attacked all the cities around Gerar because the cities were in dread of Jehovah . The army looted all the cities because there were many things to take .
They also attacked those who were letting their cattle graze and captured many sheep and camels . Then they returned to Jerusalem .
God’s Spirit came to Azariah , son of Oded .
Azariah went to Asa and said : » Listen to me Asa and all you men from Judah and Benjamin . Jehovah is with you when you are with him . If you will dedicate your lives to serve him , he will accept you . But if you abandon him , he will abandon you .
» Israel was without the true God for a long time . They were without a priest who taught correctly , and without law .
» When they were in trouble they turned to Jehovah the God of Israel . When they searched for him , he let them find him .
» No one could come and go in peace at that time . This is because everyone living in the land had a lot of turmoil .
» One nation crushed another nation . One city crushed another . God tormented them with every kind of trouble .
» But you must remain strong and not become discouraged . Your actions will be rewarded . «
Asa heard the prophet Oded’s words of prophecy . He was encouraged and put away the detestable idols from all of Judah , Benjamin , and the cities he had captured in the mountains of Ephraim . He also repaired Jehovah’s altar in front of Jehovah’s entrance hall .
Then Asa gathered all the people from Judah and Benjamin and the foreigners who had come from Ephraim , Manasseh , and Simeon . Many of them had come to him from Israel when they saw that Asa’s God , Jehovah , was with him .
In the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa’s reign , they gathered in Jerusalem .
They sacrificed to Jehovah a part of the loot they brought with them : seven hundred cattle and seven thousand sheep .
They made an agreement with one another to dedicate their lives to serve the true God Jehovah , the God of their ancestors with all their heart and all their being .
All people , young and old , male and female , who refused to dedicate their lives to the true God Jehovah the God of Israel were to be killed .
Asa and the people swore their oath to Jehovah with shouts , singing , and the blowing of trumpets and rams’ horns .
All the people of Judah were overjoyed because of the oath . They took the oath wholeheartedly . They took great pleasure in looking for Jehovah . And he let them find him . So Jehovah surrounded them with rest and peace .
King Asa also removed his grandmother Maacah from the position of queen mother . She made a statue of the repulsive goddess Asherah . Asa immediately cut the statue down , crushed it , and burned it in the Kidron Valley .
Although the illegal worship sites in Israel were not taken down , Asa remained committed to Jehovah his entire life .
He brought into God’s Temple the silver , the gold , and the utensils he and his father had set apart as holy .
There was no war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa’s reign .
It was the thirty-sixth year of Asa’s reign . King Baasha of Israel invaded Judah and built fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from going to or coming from King Asa of Judah .
Then Asa brought out all the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of Jehovah’s Temple and the royal palace . He sent them to Damascus to King Benhadad .
He said : » There is a treaty between you and me as there was between your father and my father . I am sending you silver and gold . Now break your treaty with King Baasha of Israel so that he will leave me alone . «
Benhadad agreed to do what King Asa requested . He sent his generals and their armies to attack the cities of Israel . He conquered Ijon , Dan , Abel Maim , and all the storage cities in the territory of Naphtali .
When King Baasha heard what happened he stopped fortifying Ramah and abandoned the work .
King Asa gathered men from throughout Judah and had them carry off the stones and timbers that Baasha had been using at Ramah . They used them to fortify the cities of Geba and Mizpah .
Then the prophet Hanani went to King Asa . He said : » Because you relied on the king of Syria instead of relying on Jehovah your God , the army of the king of Israel has escaped from you .
» The Ethiopians and the Libyans , did they have large armies with many chariots and cavalry troops ? But because you relied on Jehovah he gave you victory over them .
» The eyes of Jehovah keep close watch over the entire world . He gives strength shows His strength to in behalf of those whose hearts are loyal to him . You have acted foolishly ! Therefore from now on you will always be at war . «
Asa was so angry with the prophet that he had him put in chains . It was at this same time that Asa began treating some of the people cruelly .
All the events of Asa’s reign from beginning to end are recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah and Israel .
In the thirty-ninth year that Asa was king a severe foot disease crippled him . Even then he did not turn to Jehovah for help , but to doctors .
Two years later he died .
Asa was buried in the rock tomb that he had carved out for himself in David’s City . They used spices and perfumed oils to prepare his body for burial . They built a huge bonfire to mourn his death .
Jehoshaphat succeeded his father Asa as king and strengthened his position against Israel .
He stationed troops in the fortified cities of Judah . He also put troops in the Judean countryside , and in the cities that Asa had captured in the territory of Ephraim .
Jehovah blessed Jehoshaphat because he followed the example of his father’s early life and did not worship Baal .
He served his father’s God . He obeyed God’s commandments , and did not act the way the kings of Israel did .
Jehovah gave Jehoshaphat firm control over the kingdom of Judah . The people brought him gifts , so that he became wealthy and highly honored .
His heart was devoted to the ways of Jehovah . He destroyed all the pagan places of worship and the symbols of the goddess Asherah in Judah .
In the third year of his reign he sent out the following officials to teach in the cities of Judah : Benhail , Obadiah , Zechariah , Nethanel , and Micaiah .
With them were the Levites Shemaiah , Nethaniah , Zebadiah , Asahel , Shemiramoth , Jehonathan , Adonijah , Tobijah , Tob Adonijah , and the priests Elishama and Jehoram .
They taught in Judah . They had the Book of Torah the Law Jehovah’s Teachings with them when they taught the people in all the cities of Judah .
All the kingdoms around Judah were afraid of Jehovah . As a result , they did not wage war against Jehoshaphat .
Some of the Philistines brought gifts and silver as taxes . The Arabs also brought him flocks : seven thousand and seven hundred rams and seven thousand and seven hundred male goats .
Jehoshaphat became more and more powerful . He built fortresses and cities where supplies were stored in Judah .
He stored large supplies of food in the cities of Judah and an army of professional soldiers served him in Jerusalem .
The following is a breakdown of these soldiers . They are listed by families . Judah’s regimental commanders were Commander Adnah with three hundred thousand fighting men ,
next to him was Commander Jehohanan with two hundred and eighty thousand men .
There was Amasiah , Zichri’s son , who volunteered to serve Jehovah with two hundred thousand fighting men .
From Benjamin there was the fighting man Eliada with two hundred thousand armed men with bows and shields .
Next to him was Jehozabad with an army of one hundred and eighty thousand armed men .
These were the men who served the king in addition to those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout Judah .
Jehoshaphat was wealthy and honorable . He became Ahab’s in-law .
After that he went to visit Ahab in Samaria . Ahab slaughtered many sheep and cattle for a banquet in honor of Jehoshaphat and the people who were with him . Ahab persuaded Jehoshaphat to attack Ramoth in Gilead with him .
He asked : » Will you go with me to attack Ramoth ? « Jehoshaphat replied : » I am ready when you are . My army is ready . We will join you . «
He added : » But first let us consult Jehovah . «
Ahab called in about four hundred prophets . He asked them : » Should I go and attack Ramoth , or not ? « » Attack it , « they answered . » God will give you victory . «
Jehoshaphat asked : » Is there another prophet through whom we can consult Jehovah ? «
Ahab answered : » There is one more . He is Micaiah son of Imlah . But I hate him because he never prophesies anything good for me . It is always something bad . « Jehoshaphat replied : » You should not say that . «
Consequently King Ahab called in a court official and told him to go and get Micaiah at once .
The two kings , dressed in their royal robes , sat on their thrones at the threshing place just outside the gate of Samaria . All the prophets were prophesying in front of them .
One of them , Zedekiah son of Chenaanah , made iron horns and said to Ahab : This is what Jehovah says : » With these you will fight the Syrians and totally defeat them . «
All the other prophets said the same thing . » March against Ramoth and you will win , « they said . Jehovah will give you victory .
The official who had gone to get Micaiah said to him : All the other prophets have prophesied success for the king . You had better do the same .
But Micaiah answered : » By the living God Jehovah I will say what my God tells me to say . «
When he appeared before King Ahab , the king asked him : » Micaiah , should King Jehoshaphat and I go and attack Ramoth , or not ? « » Attack ! « Micaiah answered . » You will win ! Jehovah will give you victory . «
Ahab replied : » When you speak to me in the name of Jehovah , tell the truth ! How many times do I have to tell you that ? «
Micaiah answered : » I can see the army of Israel scattered over the hills like sheep without a shepherd . « Jehovah said : » These men have no leader . Let them go home in peace . «
Ahab said to Jehoshaphat : » I told you that he never prophesies anything good for me . It is always something bad ! «
Micaiah continued : » Now listen to what Jehovah says ! I saw Jehovah sitting on his throne in heaven . All his angels were standing beside him . «
Jehovah asked : » Who will deceive Ahab so that he will go and get killed at Ramoth ? Some of the angels said one thing , and others said something else ,
until a spirit stepped forward , approached Jehovah , « and said : » I will deceive him . « » How ? « Jehovah asked .
The spirit replied : » I will go and make all of Ahab’s prophets tell lies . « Jehovah said : » Go and deceive him . You will succeed . «
Micaiah concluded : » This is what has happened . Jehovah made these prophets of yours lie to you . But he has decreed that you will meet with disaster ! «
Then the prophet Zedekiah went up to Micaiah and slapped his face . He asked : » Since when did Jehovah’s spirit leave me and speak to you ? «
» You will find out when you go into some back room to hide , « Micaiah replied .
Then King Ahab ordered one of his officers : » Arrest Micaiah and take him to Amon , the governor of the city , and to Prince Joash . «
Say : » This is what the king says : ‘ Put this man in prison , and feed him nothing but bread and water until I return home safely . ’ «
Micaiah said : » If you really do come back safely , then Jehovah was not speaking through me . Pay attention to this , everyone ! «
Thus the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to Ramoth in Gilead .
The king of Israel told Jehoshaphat : » I will disguise myself and go into battle . You , however , should wear your royal robes . « So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle .
The king of Aram gave orders to the chariot commanders . He said : » Do not fight anyone except the king of Israel . «
When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat , they said : » He must be the king of Israel . « So they surrounded him in order to fight him . When Jehoshaphat cried out Jehovah helped him . God drew them away from him .
Soon the chariot commanders realized that Jehoshaphat was not the king of Israel . Then they turned away from him .
One man aimed his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between his scale armor and his breastplate . Ahab told the chariot driver : » Turn around , and get me away from these troops for I am badly wounded . «
The battle raged on and King Ahab remained propped up in his chariot , facing the Syrians . At sunset he died .
King Jehoshaphat of Judah returned safely to his palace in Jerusalem .
A prophet , Jehu son of Hanani , went to meet the king . He said to him : » Do you think it is right to help those who are wicked and to take the side of those who hate Jehovah ? What you have done has brought Jehovah’s anger upon you .
» Regardless of this , there is some good in you . You have removed all the symbols of the goddess Asherah that people worshiped . You have tried to follow God’s will . «
While Jehoshaphat was living in Jerusalem , he regularly went to the people between Beersheba and the mountains of Ephraim . He brought the people back to Jehovah the God of their ancestors .
He appointed judges in the country , in each fortified city of Judah .
He told the judges : » Be careful when you make your decisions in court . Remember these are Jehovah’s people . He will know the judgements you decide .
» Do your work in honor of him and know that he will not allow you to be unfair to anyone or to take bribes . «
Jehoshaphat also appointed some Levites , some priests , and some of the family leaders to serve as judges in Jerusalem .
He told them : » Faithfully serve Jehovah !
» Warn your relatives living in other cities about every case they bring to you , even if the case involves bloodshed or commandments , rules , or regulations derived from the law . Then your relatives will not become guilty in front of Jehovah . Otherwise , he will become angry with you and your relatives . Do this and you will not be guilty of anything .
» The chief priest Amariah will be in charge of you in every matter involving Jehovah . Zebadiah , who is the son of Ishmael and the leader of the tribe of Judah , will be in charge of every matter involving the king . The Levites will serve as officers of the court . Be strong and do your job . May Jehovah be with those who do right . «
Shortly after that the Moabites , Ammonites , and some of the Meunites came to wage war against Jehoshaphat .
Some men reported to Jehoshaphat : » A large crowd is coming against you from the other side of the Dead Sea , from Edom . The crowd is already in Hazazon Tamar En Gedi . «
Jehoshaphat was frightened and decided to ask for Jehovah’s help . He announced a fast throughout Judah .
The people of Judah gathered to seek Jehovah’s help . They came from every city in Judah .
In the new courtyard at Jehovah’s Temple , Jehoshaphat stood in front of the people .
He prayed aloud : » O Jehovah , God of our ancestors , you rule in heaven over all the nations of the world . You are powerful and mighty . No one can oppose you .
» You are our God . When your people Israel moved into this land , you drove out the people who were living here and gave the land to the descendants of Abraham , your friend , to be theirs from generation to generation .
» Our ancestors lived in this land and built a Temple to honor you .
» They believed that whenever this land is struck by war , judgement , disease , or famine , your people can pray to you at the Temple . You will hear their prayer and save them .
» You can see that the armies of Ammon , Moab , and Edom are attacking us ! Those are the nations you would not let our ancestors invade on their way from Egypt . Consequently these nations were not destroyed .
» They are now paying us back by coming to force us out of your land that you gave to us .
» You are our God . Will you judge them ? We do not have the strength to face this large crowd that is attacking us . We do not know what to do , so we are looking to you . «
All the people from Judah , their infants , wives , and children were standing in front of Jehovah .
Then Jehovah’s Spirit came to Jahaziel . He was the son of Zechariah , grandson of Benaiah , great-grandson of Jeiel , whose father was Mattaniah , a Levite descended from Asaph .
Jahaziel said : » Pay attention to me , everyone from Judah , everyone living in Jerusalem , and King Jehoshaphat . This is what Jehovah says to you : ‘ Do not be frightened or terrified by this large crowd . The battle is not yours . It is God’s .
» ‘ Attack them tomorrow as they come up the pass at Ziz . Meet them at the end of the valley that leads to the wild country near Jeruel .
» ‘ You will not have to fight this battle . Just take up your positions and wait . You will see Jehovah give you victory . People of Judah and Jerusalem , do not hesitate or be afraid . ’ ’ Go out to battle . Jehovah will be with you !
» Then King Jehoshaphat bowed low . His face was touching the ground . All the people bowed with him and worshiped Jehovah .
» The members of the Levite clans of Kohath and Korah stood up and with a loud shout praised Jehovah , the God of Israel .
» Early the next morning the people went out to the wild country near Tekoa . Before they began Jehoshaphat addressed them with these words : ‘ People of Judah and Jerusalem ! Put your trust in Jehovah your God . You will stand your ground . Believe what his prophets tell you , and you will succeed .
» After consulting with the people , the king ordered some musicians to put on the robes they wore on sacred occasions and to march ahead of the army . They sang : ‘ Praise Jehovah ! His love is eternal ! ’ «
As soon as they began singing , Jehovah confused the enemy camp ,
The Ammonite and Moabite troops attacked and completely destroyed those from Edom . Then they turned against each other and fought until the entire camp was wiped out !
Judah’s army reached the tower that overlooked the desert . They saw that every soldier in the enemy’s army was lying dead on the ground .
Jehoshaphat and his troops came to take the loot . They found among them a lot of goods , clothes , and valuables . They found more than they could carry . They spent three days collecting the loot .
They gathered in the valley of Beracah on the fourth day . Because they thanked Jehovah there , that place is still called the » Valley of Beracah « Thanks today .
All the men of Judah and Jerusalem returned to Jerusalem . They rejoiced while Jehoshaphat led them . Jehovah gave them a reason to rejoice about what had happened to their enemies .
They brought harps , lyres , and trumpets to Jehovah’s Temple in Jerusalem .
Deep respect for Jehovah came over the kingdoms in that area when they heard how Jehovah waged war against Israel’s enemies .
Jehoshaphat’s kingdom was peaceful , since his God surrounded him with peace .
Jehoshaphat ruled as king of Judah . He was thirty-five years old when he began to rule . He ruled for twenty-five years in Jerusalem . His mother’s name was Azubah , daughter of Shilhi .
Jehoshaphat carefully followed the example his father Asa had set and did what Jehovah considered right .
However the illegal worship sites on the hills were not torn down . The people still did not have their hearts set on the God of their ancestors .
Everything else about Jehoshaphat from first to last is written in the records of Jehu , son of Hanani , which is included in the Book of the Kings of Israel .
After this , King Jehoshaphat of Judah allied himself with King Ahaziah of Israel , who led him to do evil .
Jehoshaphat joined him in making ships to go to Tarshish . They made the ships in Ezion Geber .
Eliezer was the son of Dodavahu from Mareshah . He prophesied against Jehoshaphat . He said : » Jehovah will destroy your work because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah . « The ships were wrecked and could not go to Tarshish .
Jehoshaphat died and was buried in the royal tombs in David’s City and his son Jehoram succeeded him as king .
Jehoram son of King Jehoshaphat of Judah had six brothers : Azariah , Jehiel , Zechariah , Azariahu , Michael , and Shephatiah .
Their father gave them large amounts of gold , silver , and other valuable possessions , and placed each one in charge of one of the fortified cities of Judah . But because Jehoram was the oldest , Jehoshaphat made him his successor .
Jehoram was in firm control of the kingdom . He had all his brothers killed , and also some Israelite officials .
Jehoram became king at the age of thirty-two . He ruled in Jerusalem for eight years .
He followed the wicked example of King Ahab and the other kings of Israel . He married one of Ahab’s daughters . He sinned against Jehovah .
Jehovah was not willing to destroy the dynasty of David . This is because he made a covenant with David and promised that his descendants would always continue to rule .
During Jehoram’s time Edom rebelled against Judah and chose its own king .
Jehoram took all his chariot commanders to attack . The Edomites and their chariot commanders surrounded him . He got up during the night and broke through their lines .
So Edom rebelled against Judah’s rule and is still independent today . At the same time Edom rebelled , Libnah rebelled because Jehoram had abandoned Jehovah the God of his ancestors .
Jehoram made illegal places of worship in the hills of Judah . This caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to chase after foreign gods as if they were prostitutes . So he led Judah astray .
A letter came to him from the prophet Elijah . It read : This is what Jehovah the God of your ancestor David says : You have not followed the ways of your father Jehoshaphat or the ways of King Asa of Judah .
Instead , you have followed the ways of the kings of Israel . You , like Ahab’s family , have caused Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to chase after foreign gods as if they were prostitutes . You have killed your brothers , your father’s family . Your brothers were better than you .
Jehovah will strike a great blow to your people , your sons , your wives , and all your property because you did this .
You will be affected by a painful stomach disease and suffer until you die .
Later Jehovah caused the Philistines and the Arabs who lived near the Ethiopians to become angry with Jehoram .
They invaded Judah and stole the royal property from the palace . They led Jehoram’s wives and sons away as prisoners . The only one left behind was Ahaziah , his youngest son .
After this happened ; Jehovah struck Jehoram with an incurable stomach disease .
Two years later Jehoram died in terrible pain . No bonfire was built to honor him . The people had done this for his ancestors , but not him .
Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king . He ruled eight years from Jerusalem . He died , and no one even felt sad . He was buried in Jerusalem , but not in the royal tombs .
The people of Jerusalem made Jehoram’s youngest son Ahaziah king in his place , because the raiders who came to the camp with the Arabs had killed all the older sons . So Jehoram’s son Ahaziah became king of Judah .
Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to rule . He ruled for one year in Jerusalem . His mother was Athaliah , the granddaughter of Omri .
Ahaziah also followed the ways of Ahab’s family , because his mother gave him advice that led him to sin .
He did what Jehovah considered evil the same as Ahab’s family had done . After his father died , they advised him to do what Ahab’s family had done . They did this to destroy him .
He followed their advice . He joined King Joram of Israel in a war against King Hazael of Syria . The armies clashed at Ramoth in Gilead , and Joram was wounded in battle .
He returned to the city of Jezreel to recover from his wounds . Ahaziah went there to visit him .
God used this visit to Joram to bring about Ahaziah’s downfall . While Ahaziah was there , a man named Jehu confronted him and Joram . Jehu was the son of Nimshi , whom Jehovah chose to destroy the dynasty of Ahab .
Jehu carried out God’s sentence on the dynasty . He came across a group made up of Judean leaders and of Ahaziah’s nephews that had accompanied Ahaziah on his visit . Jehu killed them all .
A search was made for Ahaziah . He was found hiding in Samaria . They took him to Jehu and put him to death . But they did bury his body out of respect for his grandfather King Jehoshaphat , who had done all he could to serve Jehovah . No member of Ahaziah’s family was left who could rule the kingdom .
When King Ahaziah’s mother Athaliah learned of her son’s murder , she gave orders for all the members of the royal family of Judah to be killed .
Ahaziah had a half sister , Jehosheba , who was married to a priest named Jehoiada . She secretly rescued one of Ahaziah’s sons , Joash , took him away from the other princes who were about to be murdered . She hid him and a nurse in a bedroom at the Temple . By keeping him hidden , she saved him from death at the hands of Athaliah .
For six years he remained there in hiding , while Athaliah ruled as queen .
After a six-year wait Jehoiada the priest decided that it was time to take action . He made a pact with five army officers : Azariah son of Jeroham , Ishmael son of Jehohanan , Azariah son of Obed , Maaseiah son of Adaiah , and Elishaphat son of Zichri .
They went around Judah , gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah and the leaders of the families of Israel , and came to Jerusalem .
The entire assembly made an agreement with the king in God’s Temple . Then Jehoiada said to them : Here is the king’s son . He should be king , as Jehovah said about David’s descendants .
You must do this : One third of you , the priests and Levites who are on duty on the day of worship , must guard the gates .
Another third must be at the royal palace . And another third must be at Foundation Gate . All the people must be in the courtyards of Jehovah’s Temple .
Only the priests and Levites who are on duty should come into Jehovah’s Temple . They may enter because they are holy . The other people should follow Jehovah’s regulations .
The Levites should surround the king . Each man should have his weapon in his hand . Kill anyone who tries to come into the Temple . Stay with the king wherever he goes .
The Levites and all the Judeans did what the priest Jehoiada had ordered them . Each took his men who were coming on duty on the day of worship as well as those who were about to go off duty . Jehoiada did not dismiss the priestly divisions .
Jehoiada gave the commanders the spears and the small and large shields . They once belonged to King David but were now in God’s Temple .
The troops stood with their weapons drawn . They were stationed around the king , the altar and the Temple . They were located from the south side to the north side of the Temple .
Then they brought out the king’s son and put the crown on him . They gave him the testimony and made him king . Jehoiada and his sons anointed him . They said : » Long live the king ! «
Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king . She entered into the house of Jehovah to the people .
She saw the king was standing by his pillar at the entrance . The captains and the trumpeters were beside the king . All the people of the land rejoiced and blew trumpets . The singers with their musical instruments lead the praise . Then Athaliah tore her clothes and said : » This is treason ! Treason ! «
Jehoiada did not want Athaliah killed in the Temple area . He called out the army officers and said : » Take her out between the rows of guards . Kill anyone who tries to rescue her . «
They seized her and took her to the palace . There at the Horse Gate they killed her .
The priest Jehoiada had King Joash and the people join him . They made a covenant that they would be Jehovah’s people .
Then they all went to the temple of Baal and tore it down . They smashed the altars and idols . Then they killed Mattan , the priest of Baal , in front of the altars .
Jehoiada put the priests and Levites in charge of the work of the Temple . They were to carry out the duties assigned to them by King David . This included burning the sacrifices offered to Jehovah in accordance with the Law of Moses . They were also in charge of the music and the celebrations .
Jehoiada appointed gatekeepers for the gates of Jehovah’s temple . That way no one who was unclean for any reason could enter .
He took the company commanders , the nobles , the people’s governors , and all the people of the land , and they brought the king from Jehovah’s Temple . They went through Upper Gate to the royal palace and seated the king on the royal throne . The nobles , the governors of the people , and
all the people of the land celebrated . The city was quiet because they had killed Athaliah with a sword .
Joash began to rule when he was seven years old . He ruled for forty years in Jerusalem . His mother was Zibiah from Beersheba .
Joash did what was right in the sight of Jehovah , as long as the priest Jehoiada lived .
Jehoiada procured two wives for Joash and he had sons and daughters .
Joash wanted to renovate Jehovah’s Temple .
He gathered the priests and the Levites and said to them : » Go to the cities of Judah , and collect money throughout Israel to repair the Temple of your God every year . Do it immediately ! « But the Levites did not do it immediately .
The king called for the chief priest Jehoiada and asked him : » Why have you not required the Levites to bring the contributions from Judah and Jerusalem ? Jehovah’s servant Moses and the assembly required Israel to give contributions for the use of the Tent of Testimony of God’s promise . «
The sons of that wicked woman Athaliah had broken into God’s Temple and used all the holy things of Jehovah’s Temple to worship other gods , the Baals .
The king issued an order . They made a box and placed it outside the gate of Jehovah’s Temple .
They issued a proclamation in Judah and Jerusalem that the contributions should be brought to Jehovah . Moses required Israel to make contributions while they were in the desert .
All the officials and all the people were filled with joy . They brought money and dropped it into the box until it was full .
When the Levites brought the box to the king’s officers and they saw a lot of money . The king’s scribe and the chief priest’s officer would empty the box and put it back in its place . They would do this every day . They collected a lot of money .
The king and Jehoiada gave the money to the foremen who were working on Jehovah’s Temple . They hired masons and carpenters to renovate Jehovah’s Temple . They also hired men who worked with iron and bronze to repair Jehovah’s Temple .
The men worked and the project progressed under the foremen’s guidance . They restored God’s Temple to its proper condition and reinforced it .
When the repairs were finished , the remaining gold and silver was given to the king and Jehoiada . They used it to have bowls and other utensils made for the Temple . As long as Jehoiada was alive , sacrifices were offered regularly at the Temple .
He died at the very old age of one hundred thirty years .
He was buried in the royal tombs in Jerusalem . This was because he had done so much good for the people of Israel , for God , and for the Temple .
After the death of Jehoiada the priest , the leaders of Judah went to Joash and talked him into doing what they wanted .
The people of Judah stopped worshiping in the Temple of Jehovah God . They started worshiping idols and the symbols of the goddess Asherah . These sinful things made Jehovah God angry with the people of Judah and Jerusalem ,
However he still sent prophets who warned them to turn back to him . The people refused to listen .
God’s Spirit spoke to Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest . Zechariah told everyone that God was saying : » Why are you disobeying me and my Laws ? This will only bring punishment ! You have deserted me , so now I will desert you . «
They plotted against Zechariah . Then they followed the king’s order and stoned him to death in the courtyard of Jehovah’s Temple .
King Joash forgot that Zechariah’s father had always been a loyal friend . So when the people of Judah plotted to kill Zechariah , Joash joined them and gave orders for them to stone him to death in the courtyard of the Temple . As Zechariah was dying , he said : » I pray that Jehovah will see this and punish all of you . «
The Aramean army attacked Joash at year’s end . They came to Judah and Jerusalem and destroyed all the people’s leaders . The Arameans sent all the loot they took from Judah and Jerusalem to the king of Damascus .
The Aramean army came with a small number of men . Jehovah handed Joash’s large army over to them because Joash’s soldiers had abandoned Jehovah the God of their ancestors . So the Arameans carried out Jehovah’s judgment on Joash .
The Arameans withdrew . They left him suffering from many wounds . His own officials plotted against him for murdering the son of the priest Jehoiada . They killed Joash in his bed and buried him in the City of David . But they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings .
These were the men who conspired against him : Zabad , son of an Ammonite woman named Shimeath , and Jehozabad , son of a Moabite woman named Shimrith .
The record about his sons , the many divine revelations against him , and the rebuilding of God’s Temple is in the notes made in the Book of the Kings . His son Amaziah succeeded him as king .
Amaziah began to rule at age twenty-five . He ruled for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem . His mother was Jehoaddan from Jerusalem .
He did what Jehovah considered right , but he did not do it wholeheartedly .
Once he had firm control over the kingdom , he executed the officials who killed his father , the former king .
He did not execute their children . He obeyed Jehovah’s command written in the Book of Moses’ Teachings : » Parents must never be put to death for the crimes of their children , and children must never be put to death for the crimes of their parents . Each person must be put to death for his own crime . «
Amaziah called the people of Judah together and assigned them by families to regiment and battalion commanders for all of Judah and Benjamin . He organized those who were at least twenty years old . He had three hundred thousand of the best men for the army , those who could handle a spear and a shield .
He also hired one hundred thousand soldiers from Israel for seven thousand and five hundred pounds of silver .
A man of God approached him and said : » Your Majesty , Israel’s army must not go with you . This is because Jehovah is not with Israel . He is not with these men from Ephraim .
» If you go into battle with them God will use the enemy to defeat you . It does not matter how courageous you are because God has the power to help you or to defeat you . «
Amaziah asked the man of God : » What should I do about the seven thousand and five hundred pounds of silver I gave the troops from Israel ? « The man of God answered : » Jehovah can give you much more than that . «
Amaziah dismissed the troops that had come to him from Ephraim . They became furious with Judah and returned home .
Amaziah courageously led his troops . When he came to the Dead Sea region , he killed ten thousand men from Seir .
The Judeans captured another ten thousand alive . They took them to the top of a cliff , and threw them off the top of the cliff so that they were dismembered .
The troops that Amaziah sent back so that they couldn ’ t go with him into battle raided the towns in Judah from Samaria to Beth Horon . They killed three thousand people and took a lot of goods .
After Amaziah came back from defeating the Edomites , he brought the gods of the people of Seir , set them up as his gods , bowed down to them , and burned sacrifices to them .
Jehovah became angry with Amaziah . He sent him a prophet who asked : » Why do you dedicate your life to serving the gods of those people ? Those gods could not save their own people from you ! «
The king asked him : » Did we make you an adviser to the king ? Stop ! Do you want me to have you killed ? « The prophet stopped . He said : » I know that God has decided to destroy you because you did this . Yet you refuse to listen to my advice . «
After receiving counsel from his advisers , King Amaziah of Judah sent messengers to King Jehoash , son of Jehoahaz and grandson of Jehu of Israel , to declare war on Israel .
King Jehoash of Israel sent this message to King Amaziah of Judah : » A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon . It said : ‘ Let your daughter marry my son , but a wild animal from Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle .
» ‘ You say you defeated Edom . Now you have become arrogant enough to look for more fame . Stay home ! Why must you invite disaster and your own defeat and take Judah with you ? ’ «
But Amaziah would not listen . God made this happen because he wanted to hand over the Judeans to Jehoash because they had sought help from Edom’s gods .
Thus King Jehoash of Israel attacked . King Amaziah of Judah met him in battle at Beth Shemesh in Judah .
Israel defeated the army of Judah . The Judeans fled to their homes .
King Jehoash of Israel captured King Amaziah , son of Joash and grandson of Ahaziah of Judah , at Beth Shemesh and brought him to Jerusalem . He tore down a six hundred foot section of the wall around Jerusalem from Ephraim Gate to Corner Gate .
He took all the gold , silver , and all the utensils he found in God’s temple with Obed Edom and in the royal palace treasury . He also took hostages . Then he returned to Samaria .
Joash’s son King Amaziah of Judah lived fifteen years after the death of Jehoahaz’s son King Jehoash of Israel .
Everything else about Amaziah , from beginning to end , is written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel .
Amaziah turned away from Jehovah . So conspirators in Jerusalem plotted against him . Amaziah fled to Lachish , but they sent men to Lachish after him and killed him there .
They brought him back by horse and buried him in the city of Judah with his ancestors .
All the people of Judah took Uzziah and made him king in place of his father Amaziah .
Uzziah rebuilt Elath and returned it to Judah after King Amaziah slept in death .
Uzziah was sixteen years old when he began to rule . He ruled for fifty-two years in Jerusalem . His mother was Jecoliah from Jerusalem .
He did what Jehovah considered right , as his father Amaziah had done .
He dedicated his life to serving God in the days of Zechariah . Zechariah taught him to respect God . As long as he dedicated his life to serve God , Jehovah gave him success .
Uzziah went to wage war against the Philistines . He tore down the walls of Gath , Jabneh , and Ashdod . He built cities near Ashdod and elsewhere among the Philistines .
God helped him when he attacked the Philistines , the Arabs who lived in Gur Baal , and the Meunites .
The Ammonites paid taxes to Uzziah . His fame spread to the border of Egypt because he became very powerful .
Uzziah strengthened the fortifications of Jerusalem . He built towers at the Corner Gate , at the Valley Gate , and where the wall turned .
He also built fortified towers in the open country and dug many cisterns , because he had large herds of livestock in the western foothills and plains . Because he loved farming , he encouraged the people to plant vineyards in the hill country and to farm the fertile land .
He had a large army ready for battle . Its records were kept by his secretaries Jeiel and Maaseiah under the supervision of Hananiah , a member of the king’s staff .
The total number of family heads among these warriors was twenty-six hundred .
They commanded an army of three hundred seven thousand and five hundred soldiers . They were a powerful force that could support the king against the enemy .
Uzziah prepared shields , spears , helmets , armor , bows , and stones for slings for the entire army .
In Jerusalem he manufactured machines designed by inventive people . The machines were placed on the towers and corners to shoot arrows and hurl large stones . Uzziah’s fame spread far and wide because he had strong support until he became powerful .
However when he became powerful , his pride destroyed him . He was unfaithful to Jehovah his God . He went into Jehovah’s Temple to burn incense on the incense altar .
Azariah the priest went in after him with eighty of Jehovah’s courageous priests .
They opposed King Uzziah . They said to him : » Uzziah , you have no right to burn incense as an offering to Jehovah . That right belongs to the priests , Aaron’s descendants , who have been given the holy task of burning incense . Get out of the holy place because you have been unfaithful . Jehovah God will not honor you for this . «
Uzziah held an incense burner in his hand . He became angry . As his anger with the priests grew , a skin disease broke out on his forehead . This happened in front of the priests in Jehovah’s Temple as Uzziah was at the incense altar .
When the chief priest Azariah and all the priests turned toward him , a skin disease was on his forehead . They rushed him away . Uzziah was in a hurry to get out because Jehovah had inflicted him with the disease .
King Uzziah had a skin disease until the day he died . Since he had a skin disease , he lived in a separate house and was barred from Jehovah’s Temple . His son Jotham was in charge of the royal palace and governed the country .
Everything else about Uzziah is recorded by the prophet Isaiah , son of Amoz .
Uzziah lay down in death with his ancestors and was buried with them in a field containing tombs that belonged to the kings . People said : » He has a skin disease . « His son Jotham succeeded him as king .
Jotham was twenty-five years old when he began to rule . He ruled for sixteen years in Jerusalem . His mother was Jerushah , daughter of Zadok .
He did what Jehovah considered right , as his father Uzziah had done . Unlike his father , he did not illegally enter Jehovah’s Temple . The people continued their corrupt ways .
Jotham built the Upper Gate of Jehovah’s Temple and did extensive building of the wall at the Ophel .
He built cities in the hills of Judah . He also built forts and towers in the wooded areas .
He fought with the king of the Ammonites and conquered them . That year the Ammonites gave him seven thousand and five hundred pounds of silver , sixty thousand bushels of wheat , and sixty thousand bushels of barley . The Ammonites gave him the same amount for two more years .
Jotham grew powerful because he was determined to live the way Jehovah his God wanted .
Everything else about Jotham , all his wars and his life , is written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah .
He was twenty-five years old when he began to rule as king . He ruled for sixteen years in Jerusalem .
Jotham lay down in death with his ancestors . They buried him in the City of David . His son Ahaz succeeded him as king .
Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to rule . He ruled for sixteen years in Jerusalem . He did not do what Jehovah considered right , as his ancestor David had done .
He followed the example of the kings of Israel . He even made metal idols for worshiping other gods such as the Baals .
He burned sacrifices in the valley of Ben Hinnom . He sacrificed his son by burning him alive . This was one of the disgusting things done by the nations that Jehovah had driven out from the land Israel possessed .
He offered sacrifices and burned incense as an offering at the illegal worship sites on hills and under every large tree .
Jehovah his God handed him over to the king of Aram , who defeated him , captured many prisoners , and brought them to Damascus . He also handed him over to the king of Israel , who decisively defeated him .
In one day Pekah , son of Remaliah , killed one hundred and twenty thousand soldiers in Judah because they had abandoned Jehovah the God of their ancestors .
Zichri , a fighting man from Ephraim , killed Maaseiah , who was the king’s son , Azrikam , who was in charge of the palace , and Elkanah , who was the king’s second-in-command .
The Israelites captured two hundred thousand women , boys , and girls from their relatives the Judeans . They also took a lot of goods from Judah and brought them to Samaria .
A prophet of Jehovah named Oded was there . He went to meet the army coming home to Samaria . He said : » Jehovah the God of your ancestors handed Judah over to you in his anger . You killed them in a rage that reaches up to heaven .
» Now you intend to enslave the men and women of Judah and Jerusalem . But are you not also guilty of sinning against Jehovah your God ?
» Listen to me . Return the prisoners you have captured from your relatives , because Jehovah is very angry with you . «
Then Azariah , son of Jehohan , Berechiah , son of Meshillemoth , Jehizkiah , son of Shallum , and Amasa , son of Hadlai , some leaders of Ephraim , opposed those coming home from the army .
They said to the army : » Do not bring the prisoners here . You will make us responsible for this sin against Jehovah . Do you intend to add to all our sins ? Jehovah is very angry at Israel because we have already sinned . «
Thus the army left the prisoners and the loot in front of the leaders and the whole assembly .
Then the men who were mentioned by name took charge of the prisoners and gave clothes from the loot to all the prisoners who were naked . They provided clothes for them , gave them sandals , gave them something to eat and drink , and let them bathe . They put everyone who was exhausted on donkeys and brought them to Jericho , the City of Palms , near their own people . Then they returned to Samaria .
King Ahaz then sent for help from the kings of Assyria .
The Edomites had again invaded and defeated Judah and captured prisoners .
The Philistines raided the foothills and the Negev in Judah . They captured and began living in Beth Shemesh , Aijalon , Gederoth , Soco and its villages , Timnah and its villages , and Gimzo and its villages .
Jehovah humbled Judah because of King Ahaz of Israel . Ahaz had spread sin throughout Judah and was unfaithful to Jehovah .
King Tillegath Pilneser of Assyria attacked Ahaz . Instead of strengthening Ahaz , Tillegath Pilneser made trouble for him .
Ahaz took some of the things from Jehovah’s temple , the royal palace , and the princes . He gave them to the king of Assyria . But that did not help him .
When he had this trouble , King Ahaz became more unfaithful to Jehovah !
He sacrificed to the gods of Damascus . These were the gods who had defeated him . He thought : » The gods of the kings of Aram are helping them . I will sacrifice to them so that they will help me . But they ruined him and all Israel . «
Ahaz collected the utensils in God’s Temple . He cut them up and closed the doors to Jehovah’s Temple . He made altars for himself on every corner in Jerusalem .
And in each city of Judah , he made places of worship to sacrifice to other gods . He angered Jehovah the God of his ancestors .
Everything else about him from beginning to end is written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel .
Ahaz slept in death with his ancestors . He was buried in the city of Jerusalem because they did not put him into the tombs of the kings of Israel . His son Hezekiah succeeded him as king .
Hezekiah began to rule as king when he was twenty-five years old . He ruled for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem . His mother was Abijah , daughter of Zechariah .
He did right in the eyes of Jehovah , as his ancestor David had done .
In the first month of his first year as king , he opened the doors of Jehovah’s temple and repaired them .
He assembled the priests and Levites in the square on the east side of the temple .
He said : » Listen to me , Levites . Perform the ceremonies to make the temple of Jehovah the God of your ancestors holy . Remove anything that has been corrupted from the holy place .
» Our ancestors were unfaithful and did what Jehovah our God considered evil . They deserted him . They turned away from Jehovah’s tent and turned their backs on him .
» They also shut the doors of the temple’s entrance hall . They extinguished the lamps , and did not burn incense or sacrifice burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel .
» Jehovah was angry with Judah and Jerusalem . He made them something that shocks and terrifies people and that people ridicule , as you can see with your own eyes .
» Our fathers were killed in battle . Our sons , daughters , and wives are prisoners because of this .
» Now I intend to make a pledge to Jehovah the God of Israel so that he may turn his burning anger away from us .
» Do not be negligent , my sons . Jehovah has chosen you to stand in front of him , serve him , be his servants , and burn sacrifices . «
So the Levites started to work . From Kohath’s descendants were Mahath , son of Amasai , and Joel , son of Azariah . From Merari’s descendants were Kish , son of Abdi , and Azariah , son of Jehallelel . From Gershon’s descendants were Joah , son of Zimmah , and Eden , son of Joah .
From Elizaphan’s descendants were Shimri and Jeiel . From Asaph’s descendants were Zechariah and Mattaniah .
From Heman’s descendants were Jehiel and Shimei . From Jeduthun’s descendants were Shemaiah and Uzziel .
These men gathered their relatives and performed the ceremonies to make themselves holy . They obeyed the king’s order from Jehovah’s word and entered the Temple to make it clean .
The priests entered Jehovah’s temple to make it clean . They carried into the courtyard every unclean thing that they found in Jehovah’s Temple . Then the Levites took the unclean items outside the city to the Kidron Brook .
They started on the first day of the first month . On the eighth day they went into Jehovah’s entrance hall . For eight days they performed the ceremonies to make Jehovah’s Temple holy . They finished on the sixteenth day of the first month .
Then they went to King Hezekiah . They said : » We have made Jehovah’s entire temple clean . This includes the altar for burnt offerings , all its utensils , the table for the rows of bread and all its utensils ,
and all the utensils King Ahaz refused to use during his reign when he was unfaithful . We have restored them and made them holy . They are in front of Jehovah’s altar . «
Early in the morning Hezekiah assembled the leaders of the city and went to Jehovah’s Temple .
They brought seven bulls , seven rams , seven lambs , and seven male goats as an offering for sin for the kingdom , the holy place , and Judah . Hezekiah told the priests , Aaron’s descendants , to sacrifice the animals on Jehovah’s altar .
So they slaughtered the bulls . The priests sprinkled the blood on the altar . Then they slaughtered the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar . After that , they slaughtered the lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar .
Then they brought the male goats for the offering for sin in front of the king and the assembly , who laid their hands on them .
The priests killed the goats and poured their blood on the altar as a sacrifice to take away the sin of all the people . The king commanded that burnt offerings and sin offerings be made for all Israel .
The king followed the instructions Jehovah gave to King David through Gad , the king’s prophet , and through the prophet Nathan . He stationed Levites in the Temple , with harps and cymbals ,
and instruments like those that King David used . The priests also stood there with trumpets .
Hezekiah gave the order for the burnt offering to be presented . The offering began and the people sang praise to Jehovah . The musicians began to play the trumpets and all the other instruments .
Everyone there joined in worship . The singing and the rest of the music continued until all the sacrifices were burned .
King Hezekiah and all the people knelt down and worshiped God .
The king and the leaders of the nation told the Levites to sing to Jehovah the songs of praise that were written by David and by Asaph the prophet . So everyone sang with great joy as they knelt and worshiped God .
Hezekiah said to the people : » Now that you are ritually clean , bring sacrifices as offerings of thanksgiving to Jehovah . « They obeyed , and some of them also voluntarily brought animals to be sacrificed as burnt offerings .
They brought seventy bulls , one hundred sheep , and two hundred lambs as burnt offerings for Jehovah .
They also brought six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep as sacrifices for the people to eat .
Since there were not enough priests to kill all these animals , the Levites helped them until the work was finished . By then more priests had made themselves ritually clean . The Levites were more faithful in keeping ritually clean than the priests were .
In addition to offering the sacrifices that were burned whole , the priests were responsible for burning the fat that was offered from the sacrifices the people ate , and for pouring out the wine that was presented with the burnt offerings . Thus worship in the Temple began again .
King Hezekiah and the people were happy . For God helped them to do all this so quickly .
Hezekiah sent a message to all Israel and Judah . He wrote letters to the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh . He invited them to come to Jehovah’s Temple in Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover of Jehovah the God of Israel .
The king , his officials , and the whole assembly in Jerusalem decided to celebrate the Passover in the second month .
They could not celebrate it at the regular time because not enough priests had performed the ceremonies to make themselves holy and the people had not gathered in Jerusalem .
The king and the entire assembly considered their plan to be the right thing to do .
They decided to send an announcement throughout Israel from Beersheba to Dan . They summoned everyone to come to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover of Jehovah God of Israel . These people had not celebrated it in large numbers as the written instructions said they should .
Messengers carried letters from the king and his officials throughout Israel and Judah . The king’s order said : » Israelites should return to Jehovah the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Israel . Then he will return to the few of you who escaped from the power of the kings of Assyria .
» Do not be like your ancestors and your relatives who were unfaithful to Jehovah the God of their ancestors . He made them something that shocks people , as you have seen .
» Do not stiffen your neck like your fathers , but yield to Jehovah and enter his sanctuary that he has consecrated from generation to generation . Serve Jehovah your God that His burning anger may turn away from you .
» If you return to Jehovah , your brothers and your sons will find compassion before those who led them captive and will return to this land . Jehovah your God is gracious and compassionate . He will not turn his face away from you if you return to him . «
So the couriers passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh , and as far as Zebulun , but they laughed them to scorn and mocked them .
Nevertheless some men of Asher , Manasseh and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem .
The hand of God was also on Judah to give them one heart to do what the king and the princes commanded by the word of Jehovah .
Many people were gathered at Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month . It was a very large assembly .
They arose and removed the altars in Jerusalem . They also removed all the incense altars and cast them into the Kidron Brook .
They slaughtered the Passover lambs on the fourteenth of the second month . The priests and Levites were ashamed of themselves . They consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings to the house of Jehovah .
They stood in their regular places as instructed by the law of Moses . Moses was a man of God . The priests sprinkled the blood they received from the Levites .
Many people in the assembly had not made themselves holy . So the Levites had to kill the Passover lambs for all who were not clean and could not make their lambs holy for Jehovah .
Many people from Ephraim , Manasseh , Issachar , and Zebulun had not made themselves clean . So they ate the Passover , but not in the way the written instructions said they should . Hezekiah prayed for them : » May Jehovah forgive everyone
who have their hearts set on dedicating their lives to serve God . May Jehovah the God of their ancestors do this for those who are not clean as required for the holy place . «
Jehovah listened to Hezekiah and healed the people .
Thus the Israelites in Jerusalem celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great joy . Each day the Levites and priests praised Jehovah in song . They played Jehovah’s instruments loudly .
Hezekiah spoke encouraging words to all the Levites who had the skills to serve Jehovah . They ate the festival meals for seven days , sacrificed fellowship offerings , and confessed their sins to Jehovah the God of their ancestors .
Then the whole assembly decided to celebrate the festival for seven more days . So they joyfully celebrated for seven more days .
Hezekiah king of Judah contributed one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep to the assembly . The princes contributed one thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep to the assembly . A large number of priests consecrated themselves .
The entire assembly of Judah rejoiced with the priests and the Levites . The entire assembly that came from Israel , both the sojourners who came from the land of Israel and those living in Judah rejoiced .
There was great joy in Jerusalem . Nothing occurred like this in Jerusalem since the days of Solomon the son of David , king of Israel .
The Levitical priests arose and blessed the people . Their voice was heard and their prayer came to God’s holy dwelling place , to heaven .
When this ended , all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah , broke the pillars in pieces , cut down the Asherim and pulled down the high places and the altars throughout all Judah and Benjamin , Ephraim and Manasseh . They destroyed them all . Then all the sons of Israel returned to their cities , each to his possession .
Hezekiah assigned the priests and the Levites to divisions . Each priest or Levite was put in a division based on the service he performed . The services included : sacrificing burnt offerings , sacrificing fellowship offerings , serving , giving thanks , or praising within the gates of Jehovah’s camp .
He set aside part of the king’s property for burnt offerings , the morning and evening offerings , burnt offerings on the weekly worship days , the New Moon Festivals , and the annual festivals , as it is written in Jehovah’s Law .
He told the people living in Jerusalem to give the priests and Levites the portions they were due so that they could devote themselves to Jehovah’s Law .
As soon as the order was given , the people of Israel brought gifts of their finest grain , wine , olive oil , honey , and other farm produce , and they also brought the tithes of everything they had .
All the people who lived in the cities of Judah brought tithes of their cattle and sheep . They also brought large quantities of gifts they dedicated to Jehovah their God .
The gifts started arriving in the third month . They continued to pile up for the next four months .
King Hezekiah and his officials saw how much had been given . They praised Jehovah and praised his people Israel .
The king spoke to the priests and the Levites about these gifts ,
and Azariah the High Priest , a descendant of Zadok , said to him : Since the people started bringing their gifts to the temple , there has been enough to eat and a large surplus besides . We have all this because Jehovah has blessed his people .
On the king’s orders they prepared storerooms in the Temple area
and put all the gifts and tithes in them for safekeeping . They placed a Levite named Conaniah in charge and made his brother Shimei his assistant .
Ten Levites were assigned to work under them : Jehiel , Azaziah , Nahath , Asahel , Jerimoth , Jozabad , Eliel , Ismachiah , Mahath , and Benaiah . This was done by authority of King Hezekiah and Azariah the High Priest .
Kore son of Imnah , a Levite who was chief guard at the East Gate of the temple , was in charge of receiving the gifts offered to Jehovah and of distributing them .
In the other cities where priests lived , he was faithfully assisted in this by other Levites : Eden , Miniamin , Jeshua , Shemaiah , Amariah , and Shecaniah . They distributed the food equally to their fellow Levites according to what their duties were .
They were appointed to distribute them to males who were at least three years old . The way they were enrolled in the genealogical records did not matter . The six men who served under Kore were to distribute the offerings to everyone who went to Jehovah’s Temple to perform the daily service that each division was responsible for .
They were to distribute offerings to the priests who were enrolled by families and to the Levites who were at least twenty years old . Distribution was based on the way they served in their divisions .
The priests and Levites were enrolled with their wives , sons , daughters , and other people who depended on them in the community . The priests and Levites had to be faithful in keeping themselves holy for the holy work .
Men were appointed to give a portion of the offerings to all the males in the priestly families and to everyone listed in the genealogies of the Levites . These men were Aaron’s descendants , priests who lived in the pasturelands of every Levite city .
This is what Hezekiah did throughout Judah . He did what was good and right and true to Jehovah his God .
Hezekiah incorporated Moses’ teachings and commands into worship and dedicated his life to serving God . Whatever he did for the worship in God’s Temple , he did wholeheartedly , and he succeeded .
After everything Hezekiah had done so faithfully , King Sennacherib of Assyria came to invade Judah . He set up camp to attack the fortified cities . He intended to conquer them himself .
Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come to wage war against Jerusalem ,
He and his officers and military staff made plans to stop the water from flowing out of the springs outside the city . They helped him do it .
A large crowd gathered as they stopped all the springs and the brook that flowed through the land . They said : Why should the kings of Assyria find plenty of water ?
Hezekiah worked hard . He rebuilt all the broken sections of the wall . He built the towers taller and built another wall outside the city wall . He strengthened the Millo in the City of David , and made plenty of weapons and shields .
He appointed military commanders over the troops and gathered the commanders in the square by the city gate . He spoke these words of encouragement :
Be strong and courageous . Do not be frightened or terrified by the king of Assyria or the crowd with him . Someone greater is on our side .
Jehovah our God fights on our side . The Assyrians must rely on human power alone . These words encouraged the army of Judah .
Sennacherib and his troops were camped at the town of Lachish . He sent a message to Hezekiah and the people in Jerusalem . It said :
» I am King Sennacherib of Assyria . I have Jerusalem surrounded . Do you think you can survive my attack ?
» Hezekiah your king is telling you that Jehovah your God will save you from me . But he is lying ! You will die of hunger and thirst . «
» ‘ Did Hezekiah not tear down all except one of Jehovah’s altars and places of worship ? And did he not tell you people of Jerusalem and Judah to worship at that one place ?
» ‘ You have heard what my ancestors and I have done to other nations . Were the gods of those nations able to defend their land against us ?
» ‘ None of those gods kept their people safe from the kings of Assyria . Do you really think your God can do any better ?
» ‘ Do not be fooled by Hezekiah ! No god of any nation has been able to stand up to Assyria . Believe me , your God cannot keep you safe ! ’ «
Sennacherib’s officers said more against Jehovah God and his servant Hezekiah .
Sennacherib wrote letters cursing Jehovah the God of Israel . These letters said : The gods of the nations in other countries could not rescue their people from me . Hezekiah’s God cannot rescue his people from me .
Sennacherib’s officers shouted loudly in the Judean language to the troops who were on the wall of Jerusalem . They tried to frighten and terrify the troops so that they could capture the city .
They spoke against the God of Jerusalem as if he were one of the gods of the peoples of the earth , the work of the hands of man .
King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah , son of Amoz , prayed about this and called to heaven .
Jehovah sent an angel who exterminated all the soldiers , officials , and commanders in the Assyrian king’s camp . Sennacherib was humiliated and returned to his own country . When he went into the temple of his god , some of his own sons killed him with a sword .
So Jehovah saved Hezekiah and the people living in Jerusalem from King Sennacherib of Assyria and from everyone else . Jehovah gave them peace with all their neighbors .
Many people still went to Jerusalem to bring gifts to Jehovah and expensive presents to King Hezekiah of Judah . From that point in history he was considered important by all the nations .
Hezekiah became sick and was about to die . He prayed to Jehovah , who answered him and gave him a miraculous sign .
But Hezekiah was conceited . So he did not repay Jehovah for his kindness . Jehovah became angry with him , with Judah , and with Jerusalem .
Hezekiah and the people living in Jerusalem humbled themselves when they realized they had become conceited . Thus Jehovah did not vent his anger on them during Hezekiah’s time .
Hezekiah became richer and was highly honored . He prepared storehouses for himself to hold silver , gold , precious stones , spices , shields , and all kinds of valuables .
He built storehouses for the produce of grain and wine and oil ; and buildings for all sorts of beasts and flocks .
He made towns for himself . He gathered much property in flocks and herds : for God had given him great wealth .
It was Hezekiah who had the higher spring of the water of Gihon stopped , and the water taken down on the west side of the town of David . Hezekiah did well in everything he tried .
When the leaders of Babylon sent ambassadors to ask him about the miraculous sign that had happened in the land , God left him . God did this to test him , to find out everything that was in Hezekiah’s heart .
Everything else about Hezekiah , including his devotion to God , is written in the vision of the prophet Isaiah , son of Amoz , and in the records of the kings of Judah and Israel .
Hezekiah slept in death with his ancestors . He was buried in the upper tombs of David’s descendants . When Hezekiah died , all of Judah and the people in Jerusalem honored him . His son Manasseh succeeded him as king .
Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king . He ruled for fifty-five years in Jerusalem .
He did what Jehovah considered evil by copying the disgusting things done by the nations that Jehovah dispossessed from before the Israelites .
He rebuilt the illegal places of worship that his father Hezekiah had torn down . He set up altars dedicated to other gods such as the Baals . He erected a pole dedicated to the goddess Asherah as King Ahab of Israel had done . Manasseh , like Ahab , worshiped and served the entire army of heaven .
He built altars in Jehovah’s Temple , of which Jehovah said : » My name will be in Jerusalem from generation to generation . «
He built altars for the entire army of heaven in the two courtyards of Jehovah’s Temple .
He burned his son as a sacrifice in the valley of Ben Hinnom , he consulted fortunetellers , and he cast evil spells . He also practiced witchcraft , and appointed royal mediums and psychics . He did many things that made Jehovah furious .
Manasseh had a carved idol made . Then he set it up in God’s Temple , where God had said to David and his son Solomon : » I have chosen this temple and Jerusalem from all the tribes of Israel . I will put my name here from generation to generation .
» I will never again remove Israel from the land that I set aside for their ancestors if they will obey all the commandments , all the teachings , the ordinances , and the regulations I gave through Moses . «
Manasseh misled Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem so that they did more evil things than the nations that Jehovah destroyed when the Israelites arrived in the land .
Jehovah spoke to Manasseh and his people . But they would not pay attention .
So Jehovah made the army commanders of the king of Assyria invade Judah . They took Manasseh captive , put a hook in his nose , put him in bronze shackles , and brought him to Babylon .
When he experienced distress , he begged Jehovah his God to be kind and humbled himself in front of the God of his ancestors .
He prayed to Jehovah . And Jehovah accepted his prayer and listened to his request . Jehovah brought him back to his kingdom in Jerusalem . Then Manasseh knew that Jehovah is God .
Then Manasseh rebuilt the outer wall of the City of David from west of Gihon Spring in the valley to the entrance of Fish Gate . He made the wall go around the Ophel . He built it very high . He put army commanders in every fortified city in Judah .
Manasseh also removed the foreign gods and the idol in Jehovah’s Temple . He eliminated the altars he had built in the Temple on Jehovah’s mountain and in Jerusalem .
He built Jehovah’s altar and sacrificed fellowship offerings and thank offerings on it . And he told Judah to serve Jehovah the God of Israel .
However the people continued to sacrifice at the illegal places of worship . But they sacrificed only to Jehovah their God .
Everything else about Manasseh , including his prayer to his God and the words that the seers spoke to him in the name of Jehovah the God of Israel are in the records of the kings of Israel .
His prayer and how God accepted it are written in the records of Hozai . The things he did before he humbled himself are also written there . This includes all his sins and unfaithfulness and the places where he built illegal worship sites and set up idols and poles dedicated to the goddess Asherah .
Manasseh lay down in death with his ancestors . They buried him in his own palace . His son Amon succeeded him as king .
Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king . He ruled for two years in Jerusalem .
He did what Jehovah considered evil , as his father Manasseh had done . Amon sacrificed to all the idols his father Manasseh had made , and he worshiped them .
He did not humble himself in front of Jehovah as his father Manasseh had humbled himself . Instead , Amon continued to sin .
His officials conspired against him and killed him in his palace .
The people of the land killed everyone who conspired against King Amon . They made his son Josiah king in his place .
Josiah was eight years old when he became king . He was king for thirty-one years in Jerusalem .
He did what Jehovah considered right . He lived in the ways of his ancestor David and never stopped living this way .
It was the eighth year of his reign . He was still a boy when he dedicated his life to service of the God of his ancestor David . In his twelfth year as king he purged Judah and Jerusalem by destroying the illegal places of worship , poles dedicated to the goddess Asherah , carved idols , and metal idols .
He tore down the altars of the Baal gods . He cut down the incense altars that were above them . He destroyed the Asherah poles , carved idols , and metal idols . He ground them into powder and scattered the powder over the tombs of those who had sacrificed to them .
He burned the bones of the priests on their altars . Thus he made Judah and Jerusalem clean .
In the cities of Manasseh , Ephraim , Simeon , and as far as Naphtali , he removed all their temples .
Then he tore down the altars , beat the Asherah poles and idols into powder , and cut down all the incense altars everywhere in Israel . Then he went back to Jerusalem .
In his eighteenth year as king as he was making the land and the temple clean , Josiah sent Shaphan , son of Azaliah , Maaseiah , the mayor of the city , and Joah , the royal historian and son of Joahaz , to repair the Temple of Jehovah his God .
They came to the chief priest Hilkiah and gave him the money that had been brought into God’s Temple . It was the money that the Levite doorkeepers had collected from the tribes of Manasseh and Ephraim , from all who were left in Israel , from everyone in the tribes of Judah and Benjamin , and from the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
They gave the money to the foremen who were in charge of Jehovah’s Temple . These foremen gave it to the workmen who were restoring and repairing the Temple .
These workers included carpenters and builders . They were to buy quarried stones and wood for the fittings and beams of the buildings that the kings of Judah had allowed to become run-down .
The men did their work faithfully under the supervision of Jahath and Obadiah ; Levites descended from Merari , and Zechariah and Meshullam descendants of Kohath . The Levites , who were skilled musicians ,
also supervised the workers and directed all the workmen on the various jobs . Some of the Levites served as scribes , officials , or gatekeepers .
At the time they brought out the money that had been deposited in Jehovah’s Temple , the priest Hilkiah found the book of Jehovah’s Law written by Moses .
Hilkiah told the scribe Shaphan : » I have found the book of the Law in Jehovah’s Temple . « Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan .
Shaphan took the book to the king and reported : » We are doing everything you told us to do .
» We took the money that was donated in Jehovah’s Temple and gave it to the supervisors and the workmen . «
The scribe Shaphan told the king : » The priest Hilkiah has given me a book . « Shaphan read it to the king .
As soon as the king heard what the Law said , he tore his clothes in distress .
Then the king gave an order to Hilkiah , Ahikam son of Shaphan , Abdon son of Micah , the scribe Shaphan , and the royal official Asaiah . He said :
» On behalf of those who are left in Israel and Judah and me , ask Jehovah about the words in this book that was found . Jehovah’s fierce anger has been poured on us because our ancestors did not obey the word of Jehovah by doing everything written in this book . «
Hilkiah and the king’s officials went to talk to the prophet Huldah about this matter . She was the wife of Shallum , son of Tokhath and grandson of Hasrah . Shallum was in charge of the royal wardrobe . Huldah was living in the Second Part of Jerusalem .
She told them : » This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says : » Tell the man who sent you to me ,
» This is what Jehovah says : ‘ I am going to bring disaster on this place and on the people living here . This is according to the curses written in the book that was read to the king of Judah .
» ‘ I will do this because they have abandoned me . They have sacrificed to other gods in order to make me furious . Therefore , my anger will be poured on this place and it will not be extinguished . ’ «
Huldah continued : » Tell Judah’s king who sent you to me to ask Jehovah a question : ‘ This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says about the words you heard :
» ‘ » You had a change of heart and humbled yourself in front of God when you heard my words against this place and those who live here . You humbled yourself , tore your clothes in distress , and cried in front of me . So I will listen to you , proclaims Jehovah .
» ‘ ‘ That is why I am going to bring you to your ancestors . I am going to bring you to your grave in peace . Your eyes will not see any of the disaster I am going to bring on this place and those who live here . « ’ « They reported this to the king .
The king sent for all the respected leaders of Judah and Jerusalem to join him .
The king , everyone in Judah , everyone living in Jerusalem , the priests , the Levites , and all the people , young and old , went up to Jehovah’s Temple . He read everything written in the Book of the Covenant found in Jehovah’s Temple so that they could hear it .
The king stood in his place and made a promise to Jehovah that he would follow Jehovah and obey his commandments , instructions , and laws with his entire heart and being . He said he would live by the terms of the covenant promise written in this book .
He also made all those found in Jerusalem and Benjamin join with him in the covenant . Then the people of Jerusalem lived according to the covenant of God , the God of their ancestors .
Josiah got rid of all the disgusting idols throughout Israelite territory . He required all people in Israel to serve Jehovah their God . As long as he lived , they did not stop following Jehovah the God of their ancestors .
Josiah celebrated the Passover to Jehovah in Jerusalem . The Passover lamb was slaughtered on the fourteenth day of the first month .
Josiah appointed the priests to their duties and encouraged them to serve in Jehovah’s Temple .
He told the Levites , who instructed all Israel and performed ceremonies to make themselves holy to Jehovah : Put the Holy Ark in the Temple that Solomon , son of David and king of Israel , built . It should not be carried on your shoulders any longer . Serve Jehovah your God and his people Israel .
Get yourselves ready with the family groups of your divisions , which are listed in the records of King David of Israel and the records of his son Solomon .
» Divide yourselves into groups . Then spread out throughout the Temple so that each family of worshipers will be able to get help from one of you .
» When the people bring you their Passover lamb , you must slaughter it and prepare it to be sacrificed to Jehovah . Make sure the people celebrate according to the instructions Jehovah gave Moses . Do not do anything to become unclean and unacceptable . «
Josiah donated thirty thousand sheep and goats , and three thousand bulls from his own flocks and herds for the people to offer as sacrifices .
Josiah’s officials also voluntarily gave some of their animals to the people , the priests , and the Levites as sacrifices . Hilkiah , Zechariah , and Jehiel , who were the officials in charge of the Temple , gave the priests twenty-six hundred sheep and lambs and three hundred bulls to sacrifice during the Passover celebration .
Conaniah and his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel , and Hashabiah , Jeiel , and Jozabad , the leaders of the Levites , gave the Levites five thousand sheep and goats and five hundred bulls as Passover sacrifices .
Thus the service was prepared . The priests took their positions with the Levites according to their divisions , as the king had ordered .
They slaughtered the Passover lambs . The priests sprinkled the blood with their hands while the Levites skinned the lambs .
They set aside the burnt offerings to give them to the people according to their family divisions . The people could then present them to Jehovah as is written in the Book of Moses . The Levites did the same with the bulls .
The Levites roasted the Passover sacrifices over the fire , according to the regulations . They boiled the sacred offerings in pots , kettles , and pans , and quickly distributed the meat to the people .
After this was done , the Levites provided meat for themselves and for the priests descended from Aaron . Since the priests were kept busy until night , burning the animals that were burned whole and the fat of the sacrifices .
The following musicians of the Levite clan of Asaph were in the places assigned to them by King David’s instructions : Asaph , Heman , and Jeduthun , the king’s prophet . The guards at the Temple gates did not need to leave their posts , because the other Levites prepared the Passover for them .
Everything was done that day as King Josiah commanded for the worship of Jehovah . This included the keeping of the Passover Festival , and the offering of burnt offerings on the altar .
All the people of Israel who were present celebrated the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days .
The Passover had not been celebrated like this since the days of the prophet Samuel . None of the former kings had ever celebrated a Passover like this one celebrated by King Josiah , the priests , the Levites , and the people of Judah , Israel , and Jerusalem
This was the eighteenth year of Josiah’s reign .
Later , when Josiah had repaired the Temple , King Necho of Egypt came to fight a battle at Carchemish at the Euphrates River . Josiah went to attack him .
Neco sent messengers to Josiah . He said : » What is your quarrel with me , king of Judah ? I am not attacking you . I have come to fight those who are at war with me . God told me to hurry . God is with me , so stop now or he will destroy you . «
But Josiah would not stop his attack . He disguised himself as he went into battle . He refused to listen to Necho’s words , which came from God . He went to fight in the valley of Megiddo .
Some archers shot King Josiah . The king told his officers : » Take me away because I am badly wounded . «
His officers took him out of the chariot and brought him to Jerusalem in his other chariot . He died and was buried in the tombs of his ancestors . All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah .
Then Jeremiah chanted a lament for Josiah . All the male and female singers speak about Josiah in their lamentations dirges to this day . They made them an ordinance in Israel . They are also written in the Lamentations .
The rest of the acts of Josiah and his deeds of devotion as written in the law of Jehovah ,
and his acts , first to last , are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah .
The people of the land crowned Josiah’s son Jehoahaz as their new king in Jerusalem in place of his father .
Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king . He was king in Jerusalem for three months .
The king of Egypt removed him from office in Jerusalem and fined the country seven thousand five hundred pounds of silver and seventy-five pounds of gold .
The king of Egypt made Jehoahaz’s brother Eliakim king of Judah and Jerusalem and changed Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim . Necho took Jehoahaz away to Egypt .
Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king . He ruled for eleven years in Jerusalem . He did what Jehovah his God considered evil .
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked Jehoiakim and put him in bronze shackles to take him to Babylon .
Nebuchadnezzar also brought some of the utensils of Jehovah’s Temple to Babylon . He put them in his palace temple in Babylon .
Everything about Jehoiakim , the disgusting things he did and all the charges against him are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah . His son Jehoiakin succeeded him as king .
Jehoiakin was eight years old when he began to rule as king . He was king for three months and ten days in Jerusalem . He did what Jehovah considered evil .
In the spring King Nebuchadnezzar sent for Jehoiakin and brought him to Babylon with the valuable utensils from Jehovah’s Temple . Nebuchadnezzar made Jehoiakin’s uncle Zedekiah king of Judah and Jerusalem .
Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to rule . He ruled for eleven years in Jerusalem .
He did what Jehovah his God considered evil . He did not humble himself in front of the prophet Jeremiah , who spoke Jehovah’s word .
Zedekiah also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar . Nebuchadnezzar made Zedekiah swear an oath of allegiance to him in God’s name . But Zedekiah became so stubborn and so impossible to deal with that he refused to turn back to Jehovah the God of Israel .
All the officials , the priests , and the people became increasingly unfaithful and followed all the disgusting practices of the nations . Although Jehovah made the Temple in Jerusalem holy , they made the Temple unclean .
Jehovah the God of their ancestors repeatedly sent messages through his prophets because he wanted to spare his people and his dwelling place .
They mocked God’s messengers . They despised his words , and made fun of his prophets until Jehovah became angry with his people . He could no longer heal them .
So he had the Babylonian king attack them and execute their best young men in their holy temple . He did not spare the best men or the unmarried women , the old people or the sick people . God handed all of them over to him .
He brought to Babylon each of the utensils from God’s temple , the treasures from Jehovah’s Temple , and the treasures of the king and his officials .
He burned down the Temple and the city , with all its palaces and its wealth , and broke down the city wall .
The survivors were taken to Babylonia as prisoners . They served as slaves of the king and his sons , until Persia became a powerful nation .
This fulfilled the word of Jehovah that was spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah , until the land had enjoyed its Sabbaths . All the days of its desolation it kept Sabbath until seventy years were complete .
In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia , in order to fulfill the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah , Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia . He sent a proclamation throughout his kingdom , and also put it in writing . He said :
Thus says Cyrus king of Persia : » Jehovah , the God of heaven , has given me all the kingdoms of the earth . He has appointed me to build him a house in Jerusalem , which is in Judah . Whoever there is among you of all his people , may Jehovah his God be with him , and let him go up ! «
It was the first year of Cyrus , king of Persia . In order that the word of Jehovah given by the mouth of Jeremiah might come true , Jehovah moved the spirit of Cyrus , king of Persia . He made a public statement through all his kingdom , and put it in writing , saying :
» These are the words of Cyrus , king of Persia : ‘ Jehovah the God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth . He has made me responsible for building a house for him in Jerusalem , which is in Judah .
» ‘ May your God be with you and let you go up to Jerusalem , which is in Judah . There you are to build the house of Jehovah the God of Israel . He is the God who is in Jerusalem .
» ‘ If any of his people in exile need help to return , their neighbors should give them help . They are to provide them with silver and gold , supplies and pack animals , as well as offerings to present in the Temple of God in Jerusalem . ’ «
The heads of the clans of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin , the priests and Levites , and everyone else whose heart God had moved got ready to go and rebuild Jehovah’s Temple in Jerusalem .
Their neighbors helped by giving many things : silver utensils , gold , supplies , pack animals , other valuables , and offerings for the Temple .
King Cyrus gave back the bowls and cups that King Nebuchadnezzar took from the Temple in Jerusalem and put in the temple of his god .
And King Cyrus turned them over to Mithredath , chief of the royal treasury , who made an inventory of them for Sheshbazzar , the governor of Judah ,
Now this was their inventory : 30 gold dishes , 1,000 silver dishes and 29 duplicates .
There were also 30 gold bowls , 410 matching silver bowls and 1,000 other articles .
All the articles of gold and silver numbered 5,400 . Sheshbazzar brought all of them along with the exiles who traveled from Babylon to Jerusalem .
These are the people of the divisions of the kingdom . Included were those who had been made prisoners by Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , and taken away to Babylon , who went back to Jerusalem and Judah , everyone to his town .

The children of Asnah , the children of Meunim , the children of Nephisim ,
The children of Bakbuk , the children of Hakupha , the children of Harhur ,
The children of Bazluth , the children of Mehida , the children of Harsha ,
The children of Barkos , the children of Sisera , the children of Temah ,
The children of Neziah , the children of Hatipha .
The children of Solomon's servants : the children of Sotai , the children of Hassophereth , the children of Peruda ,
The children of Jaalah , the children of Darkon , the children of Giddel ,
The children of Shephatiah , the children of Hattil , the children of Pochereth-hazzebaim , the children of Ami .
All the Nethinim , and the children of Solomon's servants , were three hundred and ninety-two .
And these were the people who went up from Telmelah , Telharsha , Cherub , Addan , and Immer . But having no knowledge of their fathers' families or offspring , it was not certain that they were Israelites .
The children of Delaiah , the children of Tobiah , the children of Nekoda , six hundred and fifty-two .
Of the children of the priests : the children of Habaiah , the children of Hakkoz , the children of Barzillai , who was married to one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite , and took their name .
They made search for their record among the lists of families . Their names were nowhere to be found . So they were looked on as unclean and no longer priests .
The Tirshatha Governor said they were not to have the most holy things for their food , till a priest came to give decision by Urim and Thummim .
The number of all the people together was forty-two thousand , three hundred and sixty ,
As well as their men-servants and their women-servants , of whom there were seven thousand , three hundred and thirty-seven : and they had two hundred men and women to make music .
They had seven hundred and thirty-six horses , two hundred and forty-five transport beasts .
There were four hundred and thirty-five camels , six thousand , seven hundred and twenty Asses .
And some of the heads of families , when they came to the house of Jehovah which is in Jerusalem , gave freely of their wealth for the building up of the house of God in its place :
Every one , as he was able , gave for the work sixty-one thousand drachmas of gold , five thousand pounds of silver and a hundred priests' robes .
So the priests and the Levites , the people and the music-makers , the doorkeepers and the Nethinim , took their places in their towns .
When the seventh month came , and the children of Israel were in the towns , the people came together like one man to Jerusalem .
Then Jeshua , the son of Jozadak , and his brothers the priests , and Zerubbabel , the son of Shealtiel , with his brothers , got up and built the altar of the God of Israel for burned offerings . This was according to the Law of Moses , the man of God .
The returning exiles were afraid of the people who were living in the land . Regardless of that , they rebuilt the altar where it had stood before . Then they began once again to burn on it the regular morning and evening sacrifices .
They celebrated the Festival of Booths according to what is written . Each day they offered the sacrifices required for that day .
They also offered the regular sacrifices to be burned whole and those to be offered at the New Moon Festival and at all the other Festivals of Jehovah , as well as all the offerings that were given to Jehovah voluntarily .
The people had not yet started to rebuild the Temple . Yet they began on the first day of the seventh month to burn sacrifices to Jehovah .
They gave money to the stoneworkers and woodworkers . Meat and drink and oil were given to the people of Zidon and of Tyre , for the transport of cedar-trees from Lebanon to the sea , to Joppa , as Cyrus , king of Persia , had given them authority to do .
The second year and third month of their coming to the house of God in Jerusalem Zerubbabel , the son of Shealtiel , took charge of the construction . Jeshua , the son of Jozadak , and the rest of their brothers the priests and the Levites , and all those who had come from the land where they were prisoners to Jerusalem : and the Levites , of twenty years or older , were responsible for overseeing the work of the house of Jehovah .
Then Jeshua with his sons and his brothers , Kadmiel with his sons , the sons of Hodaviah , together took up the work of overseeing the workmen in the house of God : the sons of Henadad with their sons and their brothers , the Levites .
When the builders laid the foundation of the Temple of Jehovah , the priests , dressed in their robes , took their places with horns , and the Levites , the sons of Asaph , with brass instruments , to give praise to Jehovah in the way ordered by David , king of Israel .
They praised Jehovah and thanked him , saying : » He is good ; his loving kindness to Israel is for all generations . « All the people gave a joyful cry . They praised Jehovah because the foundation of Jehovah’s house was in place .
Some of the priests , Levites , heads of families and old men who had seen the first house were present . When the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes they were overcome with weeping ; and a number were crying out with joy :
So that in the ears of the people the cry of joy was mixed with the sound of weeping . The cries of the people were loud and came to the ears of those who were a long way off .
News came to the enemies of Judah and Benjamin that the people who had come back were building a Temple to Jehovah , the God of Israel .
They approached Zerubbabel and the heads of families and said : » Let us help you build for we are servants of your God , the same as you . We have been making offerings to him from the days of Esarhaddon , king of Assyria , who sent us here . «
But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the heads of families in Israel said to them : » You have no part with us in the building of a house for our God . We will do the work for Jehovah , the God of Israel , as Cyrus , king of Persia , has given us orders . «
The people of the land discouraged the people of Judah and tried to make them afraid to go on building .
They hired men to work against them and kept them from accomplishing their plans during the reign of Cyrus , king of Persia , till Darius became king .
When Ahasuerus first became king , they put on record a statement against the people of Judah and Jerusalem .
In the time of Artaxerxes , Bishlam , Mithredath , Tabeel , and the rest of his friends , sent a letter to Artaxerxes , king of Persia , writing it in the Aramaic language .
Rehum , the chief ruler , and Shimshai the scribe , sent a letter against Jerusalem , to Artaxerxes the king as follows :
The letter was sent by Rehum , the chief ruler , and Shimshai the scribe and their friends ; the Dinaites and the Apharsathchites , the Tarpelites , the Apharsites , the Archevites , the Babylonians , the Shushanchites people of Susa , the Dehaites , the Elamites ,
The rest of the nations the great and noble Osnappar took over and put in Samaria and the rest of the country over the river :
» This is a copy of the letter that they sent to Artaxerxes the king : ‘ Your servants living across the river send these words :
» We give news to the king that the Jews who came from you have come to us at Jerusalem . They are again building that uncontrolled and evil town . The walls are complete and they are repairing the bases .
» The king may be certain that when the town and its wall are completely rebuilt they will pay no tax or payment in goods or forced payments , and in the end it will be a cause of loss to the kings .
» Because we are responsible to the king , and it is not right for us to see the king's honor damaged , we have sent to give the king word of these things .
» That way a search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers . You will see in the book of the records that this town has been uncontrolled . It has been a cause of trouble to kings and countries . There were outbursts against authority in the past . That is the reason the town was laid waste .
» We give you word , that if this town and its walls is completely rebuilt , your power in the country across the river will end . «
The king sent an answer to Rehum , the chief ruler , and Shimshai the scribe , and their friends living in Samaria , and to the rest of those across the river , saying , » Peace to you :
» The meaning of the letter you sent to us has been made clear to me ,
» I gave orders for a search to be made , and it is certain that in the past this town has made trouble for kings , and that outbursts against authority have taken place there .
» Further , there have been great kings in Jerusalem . They ruled over all the country across the river . Taxes and tribute was paid to them .
» Give an order now that these men are to do no more work and that the building of the town is to be stopped till I give an order .
» Be sure to do this with all care . Do not let trouble increase to damage the king . «
Then , after reading the king's letter , Rehum and Shimshai the scribe and their friends went quickly to Jerusalem , to the Jews to compel them by force to stop .
So the work of the house of God at Jerusalem was stopped , till the second year of the rule of Darius , king of Persia .
The prophets Haggai and Zechariah , the son of Iddo , were preaching to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel .
Then Zerubbabel , the son of Shealtiel , and Jeshua , the son of Jozadak , went to work building the house of God at Jerusalem . The prophets of God were with them , helping them .
At the same time , Tattenai , ruler of the land across the river , and Shethar-bozenai , and their men , came to them and said , » Who gave you orders to go on building this house and this wall ? «
Then they said these words to them : » What are the names of the men who are at work on this building ? «
The eye of their God was on the chiefs of the Jews , and they did not make them give up working till the question had been put before Darius and an answer came by letter about it .
This is a copy of the letter Tattenai , the ruler of the land across the river , and Shethar-bozenai and his friends the Apharsachites , from across the river , sent to Darius the king .
They sent him a letter saying : » To Darius the king , all peace :
» This is to give the king word that we went to the land of Judah , to the house of the great God . It is made of large stones and has its walls supported with wood . The work is going on with diligence and they are making rapid progress .
» Then we asked the men responsible : ‘ Who gave you authority for the building of this house and these walls ? ’
» We requested their names , so that we might send you word , and give you the names of the men in charge .
» Their answer was : ‘ We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth , and we are building the house which was put up in times long past and was designed and made complete by a great king of Israel .
» ‘ But when our fathers moved the God of heaven to wrath , he gave them up into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , the Chaldaean . He sent destruction on this house and took the people away to Babylon .
» ‘ In the first year of Cyrus , king of Babylon , Cyrus the king gave an order for the building of this house of God .
» ‘ The gold and silver vessels of the house of God , which Nebuchadnezzar took from the Temple in Jerusalem , were put into the house of his god in Babylon . Cyrus the king took these from the house of his god in Babylon , and gave them to Sheshbazzar , whom he had made ruler . ’
He said to him : » Go , take these vessels , and put them in the Temple in Jerusalem . Let the house of God be constructed again in its place . «
» Then this same Sheshbazzar came and put the house of God in Jerusalem on its foundations . From that time until now the building has been going on , but it is still not complete . «
» If it seems good to the king , let search be made in the king's storehouse at Babylon . See if it is true that an order was given by Cyrus the king for the building of this house of God at Jerusalem . Let the king send us word of his pleasure in connection with this business . «
Then Darius the king gave an order and a search was made in the house of the records . This is where the things of value were stored in Babylon .
In the great house of the king in the land of Media , at Achmetha they came across a roll . This statement was put on record :
» In the first year of Cyrus the king , Cyrus the king made an order : In connection with the house of God at Jerusalem , let the house be constructed as the place where they make offerings . Let them brake ground for the foundation . Let it be 90 feet high and 90 feet wide ,
» with three lines of large stones and one line of new wood supports . Let the necessary money be given out of the king's storehouse .
» And let the gold and silver vessels from the house of God , which Nebuchadnezzar took from the Temple at Jerusalem to Babylon , be given back and taken again to the Temple at Jerusalem , every one in its place , and put them in the house of God .
» Tattenai , ruler of the land across the river , and Shethar-bozenai and your people the Apharsachites across the river , keep far from that place :
» Let the work of this house of God continue . Let the ruler of the Jews and their responsible men construct this house of God in its place .
» Further , I give orders as to what you are to do for the responsible men of the Jews in connection with the building of this house of God : That from the king's wealth , that is , from the taxes got together in the land over the river , the money needed is to be given to these men readily , so that their work may not be stopped .
» When they need young bulls and sheep and lambs , for burned offerings to the God of heaven and grain , salt , wine , and oil , whatever the priests in Jerusalem say is necessary , is to be given to them day by day regularly :
» That they may make offerings of a sweet smell to the God of heaven , with prayers for the life of the king and of his sons .
» I further give orders that if anyone makes any change in this word ; one of the supports is to be pulled out of his house . He is to be lifted up and fixed to it and his house is to be destroyed .
» May the God who has made it a resting-place for his name send destruction on all kings and peoples whose hands are outstretched to make any change in this or to do damage to this house of God at Jerusalem . I , Darius , have given this order . Let it be done with all care . «
Then Tattenai , the ruler across the river , and Shethar-bozenai and their people , because of the order given by King Darius , did as he said with all care .
The responsible men of the Jews went on with their building and progressed rapidly . The teaching of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah , the son of Iddo , helped them . They went on building till it was complete . They kept the word of the God of Israel , and the orders of Cyrus , and Darius , and Artaxerxes , king of Persia .
The construction of this house was complete on the third day of the month Adar , in the sixth year of the rule of Darius the king .
The children of Israel , the priests and the Levites , and the rest of those who had come back , kept the feast of the opening of this house of God with joy .
They gave a hundred oxen , two hundred sheep and four hundred lambs as offerings at the opening of this house of God . They gave twelve he goats as a sin offering for all of Israel . Twelve is the number of the tribes of Israel .
They put the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their order , for the worship of God at Jerusalem . This is recorded in the book of Moses .
And the children of Israel who came back kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month .
the priests and the Levites made themselves clean together . They were all clean when they put the Passover lamb to death for all those who had come back , and for their brothers the priests and for themselves .
The children of Israel , who had come back , and all those who were joined to them , after separating themselves from the evil ways of the people of the land to become the servants of Jehovah , the God of Israel , ate together .
They joyfully kept the feast of unleavened bread for seven days . Jehovah filled them with joy by turning the heart of the king of Assyria to them to give them help in the work of the house of God , the God of Israel .
Now after these things , when Artaxerxes was king of Persia , Ezra , the son of Seraiah , the son of Azariah , the son of Hilkiah ,
The son of Shallum , the son of Zadok , the son of Ahitub ,
The son of Amariah , the son of Azariah , the son of Meraioth ,
The son of Zerahiah , the son of Uzzi , the son of Bukki ,
The son of Abishua , the son of Phinehas , the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron the chief priest :
Ezra came from Babylon . He was a scribe copyist and an expert in the Law of Moses which Jehovah , the God of Israel , had given . The king was moved by Jehovah his God to give him whatever he requested .
Some of the children of Israel went with some of the priests and Levites and the music-makers and the doorkeepers and the Nethinim , to Jerusalem in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king .
He came to Jerusalem in the fifth month , in the seventh year of the king's rule .
He started his journey from Babylon on the first day of the first month . He arrived at Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month , by the good help of his God .
Ezra devoted himself to the study and observance of the Law of Jehovah . He taught its decrees and laws in Israel .
This is a copy of the letter King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra , the priest and the scribe-copyist , who put into writing the words of the orders of Jehovah and of his rules for Israel :
» Artaxerxes , king of kings , to Ezra the priest , scribe of the law of the God of heaven , all peace ;
» It is my order that all the people of Israel , including their priests and Levites in my kingdom , who are ready and have a desire to go to Jerusalem , are to go with you .
» The king and his seven wise men send you to get knowledge about Judah and Jerusalem . The Law of your God orders you .
» You are to take with you the silver and gold freely offered by the king and his wise men to the God of Israel , who’s Temple is in Jerusalem ,
» As well as all the silver and gold which you get from the land of Babylon , together with the offering of the people and of the priests , freely given for the house of their God in Jerusalem .
» Use this money to buy bulls , sheep , and lambs , with their meal offerings and their drink offerings , to be offered on the altar of the house of your God , which is in Jerusalem .
» Whatever seems right to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and gold , that do , as may be pleasing to your God .
» The vessels that have been given to you for the uses of the house of your God , you are to give to the God of Jerusalem .
» Whatever is needed for the house of your God , and which you may have to give , take it from the king's storehouse .
» And I , even I , Artaxerxes the king , now give orders to all keepers of the king's money across the river , that whatever Ezra the priest , the scribe of the law of the God of heaven , may have need of from you , is to be done with all care ,
» Up to a hundred talents of silver , a hundred measures of grain , a hundred measures of wine , and a hundred measures of oil , and salt without measure .
» Whatever the God of heaven orders let it be done completely for the house of the God of heaven . Let there not be wrath against the kingdom of the king and his sons .
» In addition , we make it clear to you , that it will be against the law to put any tax or payment in goods or forced payment on any of the priests or Levites , the music-makers , doorkeepers , Nethinim , or any servants of this house of God .
» And you , Ezra , by the wisdom of your God which is in you , are to put rulers and judges to have authority over all the people across the river who have knowledge of the laws of your God . You are to teach any who have no knowledge of them .
» If anyone does not keep the law of your God and the law of the king , take care that punishment is given to him . This is by death or by driving him from his country or by taking away his goods or by putting him in prison . «
Praise be to Jehovah , the God of our fathers , who has put such a thing into the heart of the king , to make fair the house of Jehovah that is in Jerusalem .
He has given mercy to me before the king and his government and before all the king's great captains . I was made strong by the hand of Jehovah my God which was on me , and I got together out of Israel chief men to go up with me .
These are the heads of families who were listed of those who went up with me from Babylon , when Artaxerxes was king .
Of the sons of Phinehas , Gershom ; of the sons of Ithamar , Daniel ; of the sons of David , Hattush ;
Of the sons of Shecaniah ; of the sons of Parosh , Zechariah ; and with him were listed a hundred and fifty males .
Of the sons of Pahath-moab , Eliehoenai , the son of Zerahiah ; and with him two hundred males .
Of the sons of Shecaniah , the son of Jahaziel ; and with him three hundred males .
And of the sons of Adin , Ebed , the son of Jonathan ; and with him fifty males .
And of the sons of Elam , Jeshaiah ; the son of Athaliah ; and with him seventy males .
And of the sons of Shephatiah , Zebadiah , the son of Michael ; and with him eighty males .
Of the sons of Joab , Obadiah , the son of Jehiel ; and with him two hundred and eighteen males .
And of the sons of Shelomith , the son of Josiphiah ; and with him a hundred and sixty males .
And of the sons of Bebai , Zechariah , the son of Bebai ; and with him twenty-eight males .
And of the sons of Azgad , Johanan , the son of Hakkatan ; and with him a hundred and ten males .
And of the sons of Adonikam , the last , whose names were Eliphelet , Jeuel , and Shemaiah ; and with them sixty males .
And of the sons of Bigvai , Uthai and Zabbud ; and with them seventy males .
I made them come together by the river flowing to Ahava . We were there in tents for three days . And after viewing the people and the priests I saw that no sons of Levi were there .
Then I sent for Eliezer and Ariel and Shemaiah and Elnathan Jarib and Elnathan and Nathan and Zechariah and Meshullam , all responsible men ; and for Joiarib and Elnathan , who were wise men .
I sent them to Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia , and gave them orders what to say to Iddo and his brothers the Nethinim at the place Casiphia , so that they might come back to us with men to do the work of the house of our God .
With the help of our God they got for us Ish-sechel , one of the sons of Mahli , the son of Levi , the son of Israel ; and Sherebiah with his sons and brothers , eighteen ;
And Hashabiah , and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari , his brothers and their sons , twenty ;
Of the Nethinim , to whom David and the captains had given the work of helping the Levites , two hundred and twenty Nethinim , all of them specially named .
Then I gave orders for a time of going without food , there by the Ahava River , so that we might make ourselves low before our God in prayer , requesting from him a safe journey for us and for our little ones and for all our substance .
I would not make request to the king for a band of armed men and horsemen to give us help against those who might attack us on the way . We said to the king : » The hand power protection of our God is on his servants for good , but his power and his wrath are against all those who have turned away from him . «
So we went without food , requesting our God for this : and his ear was open to our prayer .
I put on one side twelve of the chiefs of the priests , Sherebiah , Hashabiah , and ten of their brothers with them ,
I gave to them by weight the silver and the gold and the vessels , all the offering for the house of our God that the king and his wise men and his captains and all Israel there present had given :
Measuring into their hands six hundred and fifty talents of silver , and silver vessels , a hundred talents' weight , and a hundred talents of gold ,
And twenty gold basins , of a thousand darics , and two vessels of the best bright brass , equal in value to gold .
I said to them : » You are holy to Jehovah and the vessels are holy . The silver and the gold are an offering freely given to Jehovah , the God of your fathers .
» Take care of them and keep them , till you put them on the scales before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites and the chiefs of the families of Israel , in Jerusalem , in the rooms of the house of Jehovah . «
So the priests and the Levites took the weight of silver and gold and the vessels , to take them to Jerusalem into the house of our God .
Then we went away from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month , to go to Jerusalem . The hand of our God was on us . He gave us salvation from our enemies and those who were waiting to attack us on the way .
We went to Jerusalem and were there for three days .
On the fourth day , the silver and the gold and the vessels were measured out by weight in the house of our God into the hands of Meremoth , the son of Uriah , the priest ; and with him was Eleazar , the son of Phinehas ; and with them were Jozabad , the son of Jeshua , and Obadiah , the son of Binnui , the Levites .
All was handed over by number and by weight : and the weight was put on record at that time .
Those who had been prisoners , who had come back from a strange land , made burned offerings to the God of Israel , twelve oxen for all Israel , ninety-six male sheep , seventy-seven lambs , twelve he-goats for a sin-offering : all this was a burned offering to Jehovah .
They gave the king's orders to the king's captains and the rulers across the river . They gave the people and the house of God the help that was needed .
After these things were done , the captains came to me and said : » The people of Israel and the priests and Levites have not kept themselves separate from the people of the lands . They have taken part in the disgusting ways of the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Perizzites , the Jebusites , the Ammonites , the Moabites , the Egyptians , and the Amorites .
» They have taken their daughters as wives for themselves and for their sons . They have mingled the holy race with peoples around them . In fact the leaders and officials were first to do this evil . «
Hearing this , with signs of grief and pulling out the hair of my head and my chin , I took my seat on the earth deeply troubled .
Then everyone who respected the word of the God of Israel were overcome with grief because of the sin of those who came back . They gathered with me until the evening offering .
I humbled myself before God at the evening offering . I got up , with signs of grief , and fell on my knees with my hands stretched out to Jehovah my God ,
I said , » O my God , shame keeps me from lifting up my face praying to you being in your presence , my God : for our sins have increased higher than our heads and our evil-doing has come up to heaven .
» From the days of our fathers till this day we have been great sinners . Because of our sins , the kings of the lands captured us . We were given to the sword and to prison and to loss of goods and to shame of face , as it is this day .
» Now for a little time grace favour has come to us from Jehovah our God , to let a small band of us go free and to give us a nail in his holy place . Our God gives light to our eyes and a measure of new life in our prison chains .
» We are servants . Our God has not been turned away from us in our prison . He had mercy on us before the eyes of the kings of Persia , to give us new strength , to put up again the house of our God and to restore its desolate places , and to give us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem .
» And now , O our God , what are we to say after this ? For we have not obeyed your laws ,
‘ » Which you gave to your servants the prophets , saying : ‘ The land where you are going , you should take for a heritage . It is an unclean land , because of the evil lives of the peoples of the land and their disgusting ways , which have made the land unclean from end to end . ’
» Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons or do anything for their peace or well being for a very long time . That way you may be strong , living on the good of the land , and handing it on to your children for a heritage for as long as they live .
» After all this and because of our evil-doing and our great sin , and seeing that the punishment that you , O God , have given us , is less than the measure of our sins , and that you have kept from death those of us who are here ;
» Are we again to go against your orders , taking wives from among the people who do these disgusting things ? Would you not be angry with us till our destruction was complete , till there was not one who got away safe ?
» O Jehovah , God of Israel , righteousness is yours . We are only a small band that has been kept from death this day . See , we are before you in our sin . For no one may keep his place before you because of this . «
While Ezra was saying his prayer and his confession of wrongdoing he wept and fell down before the house of God . A very great number of men and women and children out of Israel came together around him , for the people were weeping bitterly .
Shecaniah , the son of Jehiel , one of the sons of Elam , answering , said to Ezra , We have done evil against our God , and have taken as our wives strange women of the peoples of the land . But still there is hope for Israel in this question .
» Let us make an agreement with our God to put away all the wives and all their children , if it seems right to my lord and to those who go in fear of the words of our God . Let it be done in keeping with the law .
» Up , now ! For this is your business , and we are with you . Take heart and do it . «
Then Ezra got up , and made the chiefs of the priests and the Levites and all Israel take an oath that they would do this . So they took an oath .
Then Ezra got up from before the house of God and went into the room of Jehohanan , the son of Eliashib . When he arrived there , he took no food or drink , for he was sorrowing for the sin of those who had come back .
They made a public statement to all Judah and Jerusalem , to all those who came back , that they were to come together to Jerusalem .
And that if anyone did not come before three days were past , as ordered by the rulers and the responsible men , all his goods would be put under the curse . He himself would be cut off from the meeting of the people who had come back .
Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin came together to Jerusalem before three days were past . It was the ninth month , on the twentieth day of the month ; and all the people were seated in the wide square in front of the house of God . They shook with fear because of this business of this business and because of the great rain .
Ezra the priest got to his feet and said to them : » You have done wrong and taken strange women for your wives , thus increasing the sin of Israel .
« Give praise to Jehovah , the God of your fathers , and do his will . Separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the strange women . «
Then all the people , answered with a loud voice : As you have said , so it is right for us to do .
» The number of people is great , and it is a time of much rain ; it is not possible for us to go on waiting outside . This is not a thing that may be done in one day or even two : for our sin in this business is great .
» So now let our rulers be representatives for all the people . Let all those in our towns who are married to strange women come at fixed times , and with them the responsible men and the judges of every town , till the burning wrath of our God is turned away from us , and this has been done . «
Only Jonathan , the son of Asahel , and Jahzeiah , the son of Tikvah , were against this , Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supporting them .
So those who had come back did so . Ezra the priest , with certain heads of families , by their fathers' families , all of them by their names , were marked out . On the first day of the tenth month they took their places to go into the question with care .
they reached the end of all the men who were married to strange women by the first day of the first month .
Among the sons of the priests who were married to strange women were these : of the sons of Jeshua , the son of Jozadak and his brothers , Maaseiah and Eliezer and Jarib and Gedaliah .
They gave their word that they would put away their wives ; and for their sin , they gave an offering of a male sheep of the flock .
Of the sons of Immer , Hanani and Zebadiah .
Of the sons of Harim , Maaseiah and Elijah and Shemaiah and Jehiel and Uzziah .
Of the sons of Pashhur , Elioenai , Maaseiah , Ishmael , Nethanel , Jozabad , and Elasah .

The history of Nehemiah , the son of Hacaliah . Now it came about , in the month of Chislev , in the twentieth year , when I was in Shushan , the castle ,
Hanani , one of my brothers , came with men from Judah . This was in answer to my request for news about the Jews who had been prisoners and escaped from captivity and about Jerusalem .
They said to me : » The small band of Jews now living there in the land is in deep trouble and shame . The wall of Jerusalem has been broken down , and its doorways burned with fire . «
After I heard these words I sat down on the ground and cried for days . I ate no food and offered prayer to the God of heaven .
I said : » O Jehovah , the God of heaven , the great God , greatly to be respected , keeping faith and mercy with those who have love for him and are true to his laws :
» Let your ear now take note and let your eyes be open . Please give ear to the prayer of your servant . At this time , day and night I pray for the children of Israel , your servants . I put before you the sins of the children of Israel that we have done against you : truly , my father’s people and I are sinners .
» We have done great wrong against you . We have not obeyed the orders , the rules , and the decisions , which you gave to your servant Moses .
» Keep in mind , O Jehovah , the order you gave your servant Moses , saying : ‘ If you do wrong I will send you wandering among the peoples :
» If you come back to me and obey my orders , even if you have been forced out and are living in the farthest horizons , I will gather you from there , and bring you to the place I have chosen as a dwelling for my name . ’
» These are your servants and your people , whom you have made yours by your great power and by your strong hand .
» O Jehovah , let your ear take note of the prayer of your servant . Of the prayers of all your servants , who take delight in worshipping your name : give help , O Jehovah , to your servant this day , and let him have mercy in the eyes of this man . « Now I was the king's wine-servant .
In the month of Nisan , in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king , when wine was before him . I served the wine to the king . Never before had I been sad when the king was present .
The king said to me : » Why is your face sad , seeing that you are not ill ? This is nothing but sorrow of heart . « Then I was full of fear .
I said to the king : » May the king live a very long time . My face should look sad for the town where my fathers are buried is devastated . It has been destroyed by fire . «
The king asked : » What is your desire ? « So I made prayer to the God of heaven .
I said to the king : » If it is the king's will , and if your servant has your approval , send me to Judah , to the town where the bodies of my fathers are buried , so that I may rebuild it . «
The queen sat by him when the king said : » How long will your journey take ? When will you come back ? So the king was pleased to send me , and I gave him a fixed time .
Further , I said to the king : » If it is the king's pleasure , let letters be given to me for the rulers across the river so that they may let me go through till I come to Judah .
» I need a letter to Asaph , the keeper of the king's park , so that he may give me wood to make boards for the doors of the tower of the house , and for the wall of the town , and for the house which is to be mine . « The king gave me this , for the hand of my God was on me .
Then I came to the rulers of the lands across the river and gave them the king's letters . Now the king sent with me captains of the army and horsemen .
Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the servant , the Ammonite , heard I was coming . They were greatly troubled because a man came to help from the children of Israel .
I stayed at Jerusalem for three days .
I got up in the night and took a small band of men with me . I said nothing to any man of what God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem , I had no beast with me but the one on which I was seated .
I went in the dark through the gateway of the valley past the Fountain of the Snake Serpent’s Well as far as the place where waste material was stored . From there I viewed the broken down walls of Jerusalem and the gateways that were burned with fire .
Then I went on to the door of the fountain and to the king's pool : but there was no room for my beast to get through .
Then in the night I went up by the stream , viewed the wall and then turned back . I went in by the valley gate .
The chiefs had no knowledge of where I had been or what I was doing . I had not then said anything to the Jews or to the priests or the great ones or the chiefs or the rest of those who were doing the work .
Then I said to them : » You see what a bad condition we are in . How Jerusalem is a waste . It’s gateways burned with fire . Come ; let us get to work , building up the wall of Jerusalem , so that we may no longer be put to shame . «
Then I gave them an account of how the hand of my God was on me , helping me . I told them of the king's words he said to me . They said : » Let us get to work on the building . « So they made their hands strong for the good work .
But Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the servant , the Ammonite , and Geshem the Arabian , hearing of it , made sport of us . They laughed at us and said : » What are you doing ? Will you go against the king ? «
I answered them : » The God of heaven will be our help ; so we , his servants , will go on with our building . But you have no part or right or any name in Jerusalem . «
The high priest Eliashib worked with his brother priest to rebuild the Sheep Gateway . They made it holy and put its doors in position . They sanctified everything as far as the tower of Hammeah including to the tower of Hananel .
The men of Jericho worked along with them . Zaccur , the son of Imri worked there also .

Hanun and the people of Zanoah were working on the doorway of the valley . They put it up and put up its doors , with their locks and rods , and fifteen hundred feet of the wall as far as the doorway where the waste material was placed .
And Malchijah , the son of Rechab , the ruler of the division of Beth-haccherem , made good the repair of the doorway with their locks and rods .
And Shallun , the son of Col-hozeh , the ruler of the division of Mizpah , made good the doorway of the fountain , building it up and covering it and putting up its doors , with their locks and rods , with the wall of the pool of Shelah by the king's garden , as far as the steps which go down from the town of David .
By his side was working Nehemiah , the son of Azbuk , ruler of half the division of Beth-zur , as far as the place opposite the last resting-places of David's family and as far as the pool that had been made and the house of the men of war .
Then came the Levites and Rehum the son of Bani . By his side was working Hashabiah , ruler of half the division of Keilah , for his division .
After him were working their brothers , Bavvai , the son of Henadad , ruler of half the division of Keilah .
And by his side was working Ezer , the son of Jeshua , the ruler of Mizpah , making good another part opposite the way up to the store of arms at the turning of the wall .
After him Baruch , the son of Zabbai , was hard at work on another part , from the turning of the wall to the door of the house of Eliashib , the chief priest .
After him Meremoth , the son of Uriah , the son of Hakkoz , was working on another part , from the door of the house of Eliashib as far as the end of his house .
After him were working the priests , the men of the lowland .
After them came Benjamin and Hasshub , opposite their house . After them Azariah , the son of Maaseiah , the son of Ananiah , made good the wall by the house where he himself was living .
After him Binnui , the son of Henadad , was working on another part , from the house of Azariah as far as the turning of the wall and the angle .
Palal , the son of Uzai , made good the wall opposite the angle and the tower which comes out from the higher part of the king's house , by the open space of the watch . After him was Pedaiah , the son of Parosh .
Now the Nethinim were living in the Ophel , as far as the place facing the water doorway to the east , and the tower that comes out .
After him the Tekoites were making good another part , opposite the great tower that comes out , and up to the wall of the Ophel .
Further on , past the Horse Gate , the priests were at work , every one opposite his house .
After them Zadok , the son of Immer , was working opposite his house . And after him was Shemaiah , the son of Shecaniah , the keeper of the east door .

After him Malchijah , one of the gold-workers to the Nethinim and the traders , made good the wall opposite the doorway of Hammiphkad and as far as the way up to the angle .
And between the way up to the angle and the Sheep Gate , the gold-workers and the traders made good the wall .
Now , Sanballat , hearing that we were building the wall , was very angry , and in his wrath made sport of the Jews .
And in the hearing of his countrymen and the army of Samaria he said : » What are these feeble Jews doing ? Will they make themselves strong ? Will they make offerings ? Will they get the work done in a day ? Will they make the stones that have been burned come again out of the dust ? «
Now Tobiah the Ammonite was with him , and he said : Such is their building that if a fox climbs to the top of it , their stonewall will be broken down .
Give ear , O our God , for we are ridiculed . Let their words of shame be turned back upon them , and let them be given up to plunder in a land where they are prisoners .
Do not let their wrongdoing be covered or their sin be washed away from before you : for they have made you angry before the builders .
So we went on building the wall . The entire wall was joined together halfway up . The people were working hard .
When the Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabians and the Ammonites and the Ashdodites , heard that the building of the walls of Jerusalem was going forward and the broken places were being made good , they were very angry .
All of them conspired to come and launch an attack on Jerusalem , causing trouble there .
We prayed to God and stationed men on watch against them day and night .
Judah said : » The strength of the workmen is giving way . There is a lot of rubbish so it is impossible for us to put up the wall . «
And our adversaries kept saying : » They will not know and they will not see until we come right in among them and put them to death . We will cause the work to cease . «
When the Jews who were living near them came , they said to us ten times : » From all directions they are coming against us . «
So in the lowest part of the space at the back of the walls , in the open places , I put the people by families , with their swords , their spears , and their bows .
And after looking , I got up and said to the great ones and to the chiefs and to the rest of the people , » Have no fear of them . Keep in mind Jehovah who is great and greatly to be feared . Take up arms for your brothers , your sons , and your daughters , your wives and your houses . «
When our enemies heard that we had knowledge of their designs and that God had made their purpose come to nothing , we all went back to the wall , everyone to his work .
From that time , half of my servants were doing their part of the work , and half kept the spears and body-covers and the bows and the metal wardresses . The leaders were in back of the men of Judah .
Those who were building the wall and those who were moving material did their part . Everyone worked with one hand and with his spear in the other .
Every builder was working with his sword at his side . By my side was a man for sounding the warning horn .
I said to the leaders and the rest of the people : » The work is extensive and widely spaced and we are far away from one another on the wall .
» Wherever you may be when the horn is sounded , come here to us . Our God will fight for us . «
So we went on with the work . Half of them had spears in their hands from the dawn of the morning till the stars were seen .
At the same time I said to the people : » Let everyone with his servant come inside Jerusalem for the night . At night they may keep watch for us , and go on working by day . «
Not one of us , I or my brothers or my servants or the watchmen who were with me , changed clothes . Everyone went armed to the water .
Then there was a great outcry from the people and their wives against their countrymen the Jews .
Some said : » We with our sons and our daughters are a great number . Let us get grain , so that we may have food for our needs . «
There were some who said : » We are giving our fields and our vine-gardens and our houses for debt . Let us get grain because we are in need . «
Yet others said : » We have given up our fields and our vine-gardens to get money for the king's taxes .
» But our flesh is the same as the flesh of our countrymen , and our children as their children . Now we give our sons and daughters into the hands of others , to be their servants . Some of our daughters are servants even now . We have no power to stop this . For other men have our fields and our vine-gardens . «
On hearing their outcry and what they said I was very angry .
After giving it much thought , I made a protest to the chiefs and the rulers , and said to them : » Everyone of you is collecting interest from his brothers . « I organized a big meeting of protest .
I said to them : » We have given whatever we were able to give , to make our brothers the Jews free . They were servants and prisoners of the nations . Would you now give up your brothers for a price ? Are they to become our property ? « They said nothing . They answered not a word !
I said : » What you are doing is not good . Is it not necessary for you to walk out of respect for our God , because of the shame the nations put on us ?
» Even I and my servants have been collecting interest Usury for the money and the grain we have let them have . So now , let us give this up .
» Give back to them this very day their fields , their vine-gardens , their olive-gardens , and their houses , as well as a hundredth part of the money and the grain and the wine and the oil that you have taken from them . «
They said : » We will give them back , and take nothing for them . We will do as you say . « Then I sent for the priests and made them take an oath that they would keep this agreement .
Shaking out the folds of my robe , I said : » So , may God send out from his house and his work every man who does not keep this agreement . Even so let him be sent out and made as nothing . « All the people said : » Amen ! « They praised Jehovah . The people did as they said .
From the time when I was made ruler of the people in the land of Judah , from the twentieth year till the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king , for twelve years , my servants and I have never taken the food that was the right of the ruler .
Earlier rulers who came before me made the people responsible for their upkeep , and took from them bread and wine at the rate of forty shekels of silver . Even their servants were lords over the people . But I did not do so , out of reverence for God .
I kept on with the work of this wall . We got no land for ourselves . All my servants helped with the work .
There is more , a hundred and fifty of the Jews and the rulers were guests at my table , in addition to those who came to us from the nations nearby .
The food for one day included : one bull and six fat sheep , as well as fowls ; and once in ten days a store of all sorts of wine . All the same , I did not take the food to which the ruler had a right , because the people were crushed under a hard yoke .
Keep in mind , O my God , for my good , all I have done for this people .
Word was given to Sanballat and Tobiah and to Geshem the Arabian and to the rest of our enemies , that I had done the building of the wall and that there were no more broken places in it though even then I had not put up the gates in the gateways .
Sanballat and Geshem sent to me saying : » Come ; let us have a meeting in one of the little towns in the lowland of Ono . « But their purpose was to do me evil .
I sent men to them saying : » I am doing a great work , so that it is not possible for me to come . Should the work to be stopped while I go away from it and come to you ? «
They sent this to me four times . I sent them the same answer .
Then Sanballat sent his servant to me a fifth time with an open letter in his hand .
There was written in it : » It has been heard among the nations what Geshem is saying . He is saying that you and the Jews are hoping to make yourselves free from the king's authority . That this is why you are building the wall . They say that it is your purpose to be their king .
» And that you have prophets preaching about you in Jerusalem , and saying : ‘ There is a king in Judah . ’ ’ Now an account of these things will be sent to the king . So come now , and let us have a discussion . «
I responded to him , saying : » No such things as you say are being done . They are only a fiction you have made up yourself . «
They hoped to put fear in us , saying : » Their hands will become feeble and give up the work so that it may not get done . « But now , O God , make my hands strong .
And I went to the house of Shemaiah , the son of Delaiah , the son of Mehetabel , who was confined in his house . He said : » Let us have a meeting in the house of God , inside the Temple , and let the doors be closed for they will come to kill you . Truly , in the night they will come to kill you . «
I replied : » Am I the sort of man to go in flight ? What man , in my position , would go into the Temple to keep safe ? I will not go in . «
Then it became clear to me that God had not sent him . He spoke prophecy against me . Tobiah and Sanballat paid him money to do so .
For this reason they paid him money , in order that I might be overcome by fear and do what he said and do wrong . Then they would have reason to say evil about me and put shame on me .
Keep in mind , O my God , Tobiah and Sanballat and what they did , and Noadiah , the woman prophet , and the rest of the prophets whose purpose was to frighten me .
The wall was complete on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul . It took fifty-two days .
When our enemies had news of this , all the nations round about us were full of fear and were greatly shamed . They saw that our God had done this work .
The leaders of Judah exchanged letters with Tobiah .
For in Judah there were a number of people who had made an agreement by oath with him . For he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah , the son of Arah and his son Jehohanan had taken as his wife the daughter of Meshullam , the son of Berechiah .
They spoke a good deal about the good he had done in my presence , and reported what I said to him . Tobiah sent letters with the purpose of causing me fear .
When the building of the wall was complete I put up the doors . The doorkeepers and the music-makers and the Levites had been given their places ,
I appointed my brother Hanani , and Hananiah , the ruler of the tower , responsible for the government of Jerusalem . For he was a man of good faith , respecting God more than most .
I said to them : » Do not let the doors of Jerusalem be open till the sun is high and when the watchmen are in their places . Shut the doors and lock them . Let the people of Jerusalem be responsible for the watch , every one in his watch near his house . «
The town was large and spacious . But the people in it were only a small number , and the houses had not been built .
My God put it into my heart to get together the rulers and the chiefs and the people to list them by families . I came across a record of the names of those who came up at the first , and in it I saw these words :
These are the people of the divisions of the kingdom , among those who had been made prisoners by Nebuchadnezzar , the king of Babylon , and taken away by him , who went back to Jerusalem and Judah , every one to his town :

The children of Immer , a thousand and fifty-two .
The children of Pashhur , a thousand , two hundred and forty-seven .
The children of Harim , a thousand and seventeen .

The Nethinim : the children of Ziha , the children of Hasupha , the children of Tabbaoth ,
The children of Keros , the children of Sia , the children of Padon ,
The children of Lebana , the children of Hagaba , the children of Salmai ,
The children of Hanan , the children of Giddel , the children of Gahar ,

The children of Jaala , the children of Darkon , the children of Giddel ,
The children of Shephatiah , the children of Hattil , the children of Pochereth-hazzebaim , the children of Amon .
All the Nethinim and the children of Solomon's servants were three hundred and ninety-two .
All these were the people who went up from Tel-melah , Tel-harsha , Cherub , Addon , and Immer ; but because they had no knowledge of their fathers' families or offspring , it was not certain if they were Israelites :
The children of Delaiah , the children of Tobiah , the children of Nekoda , six hundred and forty-two .
And of the priests : the children of Hobaiah , the children of Hakkoz , the children of Barzillai , who was married to one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite , and took their name .
They searched for their record among the lists of families , but their names were nowhere to be seen , so they were looked on as unclean and no longer priests .
And the Tirshatha governor said that they were not to have the most holy things for their food , till a priest came to give decision by the Urim and Thummim .
The number of all the people together was forty-two thousand , three hundred and sixty .
As well as their men-servants and their women-servants , of whom there were seven thousand , three hundred and thirty-seven . They had two hundred and forty-five men and women to make music .
They had seven hundred and thirty-six horses , two hundred and forty-five transport beasts .
They also had four hundred and thirty-five camels , six thousand , seven hundred and twenty asses .
Some of the heads of families gave money for the work . The Tirshatha gave to the store a thousand darics of gold , fifty basins , and five hundred and thirty priests' robes .
Some of the heads of families gave to the store for the work twenty thousand darics of gold , and two thousand , two hundred pounds of silver .
That which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold , and two thousand pounds of silver , and sixty-seven priests' robes .
The priests , Levites , gatekeepers , singers , some of the people and the Nethinim , and all Israel , were living in their towns . When the seventh months arrived , the sons of Israel were then in their cities .
When the seventh month came , the children of Israel were in their towns . All the people came together like one man into the wide place in front of the Water Gate . They requested Ezra the scribe that he would bring them the book of the Law of Moses that Jehovah gave to Israel .
Ezra the priest brought the law to the meeting of the people . They were all able to listen to it . It was the first day of the seventh month .
He read it in the wide place in front of the Water Gate from early morning till the middle of the day . Everyone who could understand it , men and women alike were able to listen to it . All the people got to hear the Book of the Law .
Ezra the scribe took his place on a tower podium of wood that they had made for the purpose . By his side were placed Mattithiah and Shema and Anaiah and Uriah and Hilkiah and Maaseiah on the right ; and on the left , Pedaiah and Mishael and Malchijah and Hashum and Hashbaddanah , Zechariah and Meshullam .
Ezra took the book and opened it before the eyes of all the people for he was higher than the people . When it was open , all the people stood on their feet .
Ezra praised Jehovah , the great God . And all the people said : » Amen ! « With lifted hands and bent heads they worshiped Jehovah . They dropped to their faces on the earth .
And Jeshua and Bani and Sherebiah and Jamin , Akkub , Shabbethai , Hodiah , Maaseiah , Kelita , Azariah , Jozabad , Hanan , Pelaiah , and the Levites made the law clear to the people : and the people kept in their places .
They read from the book the Law of God making it clear translating it , so that their minds were able to take it in .
Nehemiah , who was the Tirshatha Governor , and Ezra , the priest and scribe , and the Levites who were the teachers of the people , said to all the people : » This day is holy to Jehovah your God . Let there be no sorrow or weeping . « For all the people were weeping on hearing the words of the law .
He said to them : » Go away now , and take the fat for your food and the sweet for your drink , and send some to him for whom nothing is made ready . This day is holy to our Lord . Let there be no grief in your hearts . The joy of Jehovah is your strong place . «
So the Levites made all the people quiet , saying : » Be quiet , for the day is holy ; and do not give way to grief . «
All the people went away to take food and drink , and to send food to others , and to be glad , because the words that were said to them had been clearly communicated .
The second day the heads of families of all the people and the priests and the Levites came together to Ezra the scribe , to give attention to the words of the law .
They saw that it was recorded in the law that Jehovah gave orders by Moses , that the children of Israel were to have tents for their living-places in the feast of the seventh month :
They were to give an order , and make it public in all their towns and in Jerusalem , saying : Go out to the mountain and get olive branches and branches of field olives oil trees and of myrtle , and palm branches and branches of thick trees , to make tents , as it says in the book .
The people went out and got them and made themselves tents . Every one on the roof of his house , and in the open spaces and in the open squares of the House of God , and in the wide place of the Water Gate , and the wide place of the Gate of Ephraim .
All the people who had been prisoners and had come back , made tents and were living in them . From the time of Jeshua , the son of Nun , till that day , the children of Israel had not done so . There was very great joy !
Day by day , from the first day till the last , he read from the book of the Law of God . They kept the feast for seven days : and on the eighth day there was a holy meeting , as it is ordered in the law .
Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month the children of Israel came together , taking no food and putting sackcloth and dust on their bodies .
The seed of Israel made themselves separate from all the men of other nations . They publicly requested forgiveness for their sins and the wrongdoing of their fathers .
For a fourth part of the day , upright in their places , they read from the book of the Law of their God . For a fourth part of the day they requested forgiveness and worshipped Jehovah their God .
Then Jeshua , and Bani , Kadmiel , Shebaniah , Bunni , Sherebiah , Bani , and Chenani took their places on the steps of the Levites and cried in a loud voice to Jehovah their God .
Then the Levites , Jeshua , and Kadmiel , Bani , Hashabneiah , Sherebiah , Hodiah , Shebaniah , and Pethahiah said : » Get up and give praise to Jehovah your God forever and ever . Praise your great name that is lifted up high over all , blessing and praise .
» You are Jehovah , even you only ! You made heaven , the heaven of heavens with all their armies , the earth and all things in it , the seas and everything in them . You keep them from destruction and the armies of heaven are your worshippers .
» You are Jehovah , the true God , who took Abram and made him yours , guiding him from Ur of the Chaldees , and gave him the name of Abraham ;
» You saw that his heart was true to you , and made an agreement with him to give the land of the Canaanite , the Hittite , the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Jebusite and the Girgashite , even to give it to his seed , and you have done what you said ; for righteousness is yours .
» You saw the trouble of our fathers in Egypt , and their cry came to your ears by the Red Sea .
» You did signs and wonders on Pharaoh and all his servants and all the people of his land . You saw how cruel they were to them . So you made a name for yourself as it is today .
» You parted the sea before them , so that they went through the sea on dry land ; and those who went after them went down into the deep , like a stone into great waters .
» And you went before them by day in a pillar of cloud and in a pillar of fire by night , to give them light on the way they were to go .
» You came down on Mount Sinai , and your voice came to them from heaven , giving them right decisions and true laws , good rules and orders .
» They received word of your holy Sabbath from you . You gave them orders and rules and a law , by the hand of Moses your servant .
» They received bread from heaven when they were in need , and you made water come out of the rock for their drink , and gave them orders to go in and take for their heritage the land that your hand give them .
» But they and our fathers , in their pride , made their necks stiff , and paid no attention to your orders .
» They would not obey you and gave no thought to the wonders you did among them . They became stubborn and turning away from you . They appointed a leader over themselves to take them back to their prison in Egypt . However , you are a God of forgiveness , full of grace and pity , slow to wrath and great in mercy , and you did not give them up .
» Even when they made for themselves a bull out of metal , and said : ‘ This is your God who took you up out of Egypt , and had done so much to make you angry . ’
» Even then , in your great mercy , you did not give them up in the wilderness . The pillar of cloud still went before them by day , guiding them on their way , and the pillar of fire by night , to give them light , and make clear the way they were to go .
» You gave your good Spirit to be their teacher . You did not hold back your manna from their mouths . You gave them water when they had need of it .
» Truly , for forty years you were their support in the wilderness . They needed nothing . Their clothing did not get old or their feet become tired .
» You gave them kingdoms and peoples , making distribution to them in every part of the land . They took for their heritage the land of Sihon , even the land of the king of Heshbon , and the land of Og , king of Bashan .
» You made their children as great in number as the stars of heaven . You took them into the land , of which you had said to their fathers that they were to go in and take it for themselves .
» So the children went in and took the land . You overcame before them the people of the land , the Canaanites , and gave them up into their hands , with their kings and the people of the land , so that they might do with them whatever it was their pleasure to do .
» And they took walled towns and a fat land . They became the owners of houses full of all good things , water-holes cut in the rock , vine-gardens and olive-gardens and a wealth of fruit-trees . They had food enough and became fat , and had joy in the good you gave them .
» But they were hard-hearted , and went against your authority . They turned their backs on your law , and murdered your prophets . These prophets gave witness against them with the purpose of turning them back again to you . They did much to make you angry .
» So you gave them up into the hands of their enemies who were cruel to them . In the time of their trouble , when they prayed to you , you listened to them from heaven . In your great mercy you gave them saviors , who made them free from the hands of their enemies .
» When they had rest , they did evil again before you : so you gave them into the hands of their enemies who ruled over them . When they came back and prayed to you , you listened to them from heaven ; again and again , in your mercy , you gave them salvation .
» You admonished them so that you might make them come back again to your law . Their hearts were lifted up , and they paid no attention to your orders . They went against your life giving decisions and turned their backs on you . They were stubborn and did not listen .
» You put up with them for years . You admonished them by your Spirit through your prophets . Still they did not listen . So you gave them up into the hands of the peoples of the lands .
» Even then , in your great mercy , you did not put an end to them completely , or give them up ; for you are a God of grace loving-kindness and mercy .
» Now , our God , the great , the strong , the God who is to be respected , who keeps faith and mercy , do not let his trouble seem small to you . It has come on us , and on our kings and our rulers and on our priests and our prophets and our fathers and on all your people from the time of the kings of Assyria till this day .
» You have been in the right in everything that happened to us . You have been true to us , but we have done evil !
» Our kings , our rulers , our priests , and our fathers have not obeyed your Law or given attention to your orders and your witness , with which you gave witness against them .
» They have not been your servants in their kingdom ! In all the good things you gave them , and in the great and fat land you gave them they have not turned away from their evil doing .
» Today , we are servants ! As for the land you gave to our fathers , so that the produce of it and the good might be theirs , see , we are servants in it !
» And it gives much increase to the kings whom you have put over us because of our sins . They have power over our bodies and over our cattle at their pleasure , and we are in great trouble .
» And because of all this we are making an agreement in good faith , and putting it in writing . Our rulers , our Levites , and our priests are putting their names to it . «
Now those who put down their names were Nehemiah the Tirshatha Governor , the son of Hacaliah , and Zedekiah ,

And the rest of the people , the priests , the Levites , the gate keepers , the music-makers , the Nethinim , and all those who made themselves separate from the peoples of the lands , to keep the Law of God , their wives , their sons , and their daughters , everyone who had knowledge and wisdom ;
They were united with their brothers , their rulers , and put themselves under a curse and an oath , to keep their steps in the way of God's law , which was given by Moses , the servant of God , and to keep and do all the orders of the Jehovah , our Lord , and his decisions and his rules .
That way we would not give our daughters to the peoples of the lands , or take their daughters for our sons ;
If the peoples of the lands come to do trade in goods or food on the Sabbath day , that we would do no trade with them on the Sabbath or on a holy day . In the seventh year we would take no payment from any debtor .
We made rules for ourselves , taxing ourselves a third of a shekel every year for the upkeep of the House of our God .
For the holy bread , and for the regular meal offering and the regular burned offering on the Sabbaths and at the new moon and the fixed feasts , and for the sin-offerings to take away the sin of Israel , and for all the work of the house of our God .
And we , the priests and the Levites and the people , made selection , by the decision of Jehovah , of those who were to take the wood offering into the house of God , by families at the regular times , year by year , to be burned on the altar of Jehovah our God , as it is recorded in the law ;
To take the first fruits of our land , and the first fruits of every sort of tree , year by year , into the house of Jehovah .
As well as the first of our sons and of our cattle , as it is recorded in the law . The first lambs of our herds and of our flocks , which are to be taken to the house of our God , to the priests who are servants in the house of our God :
That we would take the first of our rough meal , and our lifted offerings , and the fruit of every sort of tree , and wine and oil , to the priests , to the rooms of the house of our God . The tenth of the produce of our land to the Levites for the Levites , take a tenth in all the towns of our ploughed land .
The priest , the son of Aaron , is to be with the Levites , when the Levites take the tenths . The Levites are to take a tenth of the tenths into the house of our God , to the rooms , into the storehouse .
The children of Israel and the children of Levi are to take the lifted offering of the grain and wine and oil into the rooms where the vessels of the holy place are . This is together with the priests and the gatekeepers and the makers of music . We will not give up caring for the House of our God .
The rulers of the people lived in Jerusalem . One out of every ten people was selected by chance to live in Jerusalem , the holy town . The other nine were to go to the other towns .
the people gave a blessing to all the men who freely offered to take up their places in Jerusalem .
These are the chiefs of the divisions of the country who were living in Jerusalem : but in the towns of Judah everyone was living on his heritage in the towns , that is , Israel , the priests , the Levites , the Nethinim , and the children of Solomon's servants .
Other people of the children of Judah and of Benjamin lived in Jerusalem . Of the children of Judah : Athaiah , the son of Uzziah , the son of Zechariah , the son of Amariah , the son of Shephatiah , the son of Mahalalel , of the children of Perez ;
And Maaseiah , the son of Baruch , the son of Col-hozeh , the son of Hazaiah , the son of Adaiah , the son of Joiarib , the son of Zechariah , the son of the Shilonite .

Of the Levites : Shemaiah , the son of Hasshub , the son of Azrikam , the son of Hashabiah , the son of Bunni ,
And Shabbethai and Jozabad , of the chiefs of the Levites , who were responsible for the outside business of the house of God ;
And Mattaniah , the son of Mica , the son of Zabdi , the son of Asaph , who had to give the first note of the song of praise in prayer , and Bakbukiah , the second among his brothers , and Abda , the son of Shammua , the son of Galal , the son of Jeduthun .
All the Levites in the holy town were two hundred and eighty-four .
In addition the gatekeepers , Akkub , Talmon , and their brothers who kept watch at the gates , were a hundred and seventy-two .
And the rest of Israel , of the priests , the Levites , in all the towns of Judah , every one in his heritage .
But the Nethinim were living in the Ophel ; and Ziha and Gishpa were over the Nethinim .
The overseer of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi , the son of Bani , the son of Hashabiah , the son of Mattaniah , the son of Mica , of the sons of Asaph , the music-makers , who was over the business of the house of God .
There was an order from the king about them and a regular amount for the music-makers , for their needs day by day .
Pethahiah , the son of Meshezabel , of the sons of Zerah , the son of Judah , was the king's servant in everything to do with the people .
And for the villages with their fields , some of the men of Judah were living in Kiriath-arba Hebron and its villages , and in Dibon and its villages , and in Jekabzeel and its villages ,
In Jeshua , and in Moladah , and Beth-pelet ,
In Hazar-shual , and in Beer-sheba and its villages ,
And in Ziklag , and in Meconah and its villages .
In En-rimmon , and in Zorah , and in Jarmuth ,
And Zanoah , Adullam and their villages , Lachish and its fields , Azekah and its villages . So they were living from Beer-sheba to the valley of Hinnom .
The children of Benjamin were living from Geba , at Michmash and Aija , and at Beth-el and its villages .
At Anathoth , Nob , Ananiah ,
Hazor , Ramah , Gittaim ,
Hadid , Zeboim , Neballat ,
Lod and Ono , the valley of expert workers .
Certain divisions in Judah were joined to Benjamin of the Levites .
These are the priests and the Levites who went up with Zerubbabel , the son of Shealtiel , and Jeshua : Seraiah , Jeremiah , Ezra ,
Amariah , Malluch , Hattush ,
Shecaniah , Rehum , Meremoth ,
Iddo , Ginnethoi , Abijah ,
Mijamin , Maadiah , Bilgah ,
Shemaiah , and Joiarib , Jedaiah ,
Sallu , Amok , Hilkiah , Jedaiah . These were the chiefs of the priests and of their brothers in the days of Jeshua .
The Levites : Jeshua , Binnui , Kadmiel , Sherebiah , Judah , and Mattaniah , who was over the music-makers , he and his brothers .
Bakbukiah and Unno , their brothers , were opposite them in their watches .
Jeshua was the father of Joiakim , and Joiakim was the father of Eliashib , and Eliashib was the father of Joiada ,
And Joiada was the father of Jonathan , and Jonathan was the father of Jaddua .
In the days of Joiakim there were priests , heads of families : of Seraiah , Meraiah ; of Jeremiah , Hananiah ;
Of Ezra , Meshullam ; of Amariah , Jehohanan ;
Of Malluchi , Jonathan ; of Shebaniah , Joseph ;
Of Harim , Adna ; of Meraioth , Helkai ;
Of Iddo , Zechariah ; of Ginnethon , Meshullam ;
Of Abijah , Zichri ; of Miniamin , of Moadiah , Piltai ;
Of Bilgah , Shammua ; of Shemaiah , Jehonathan ;
And of Joiarib , Mattenai ; of Jedaiah , Uzzi ;
Of Sallai , Kallai ; of Amok , Eber ;
Of Hilkiah , Hashabiah ; of Jedaiah , Nethanel .
The Levites in the days of Eliashib , Joiada , and Johanan , and Jaddua , were listed as heads of families ; and the priests , when Darius the Persian was king .
The sons of Levi , heads of families , were recorded in the book of the histories , even till the days of Johanan , the son of Eliashib .
The chiefs of the Levites : Hashabiah , Sherebiah , and Jeshua , the son of Kadmiel , with their brothers opposite them , to give blessing and praise as ordered by David , the man of God , watch against watch .
Mattaniah , and Bakbukiah , Obadiah , Meshullam , Talmon , Akkub , were gatekeepers keeping the watch at the storehouses of the gates .
These were in the days of Joiakim , the son of Jeshua , the son of Jozadak , and in the days of Nehemiah the ruler and of Ezra the priest , the scribe .
When the time came for the wall of Jerusalem to be made holy , they sent for the Levites out of all their places to come to Jerusalem , to keep the feast with joy , and with praise and melody , with brass and corded instruments of music .
The sons of the music-makers came together from the lowland round about Jerusalem and from the villages of the Netophathites ,
From Beth-gilgal and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth : for the music-makers made villages for themselves round about Jerusalem .
The priests and the Levites made themselves clean ; and they made the people clean , and the gateways and the wall .
Then I made the rulers of Judah come up on the wall , and I put in position two great bands of them who gave praise , walking in ordered lines . One went to the right on the wall toward the gateway where the waste was put .
Hoshaiah and half of the rulers of Judah followed after them ,
And Azariah , Ezra , and Meshullam ,
Judah and Benjamin and Shemaiah and Jeremiah ,
Some of the priests' sons with wind instruments ; Zechariah , the son of Jonathan , the son of Shemaiah , the son of Mattaniah , the son of Micaiah , the son of Zaccur , the son of Asaph ,
His brothers , Shemaiah , and Azarel , Milalai , Gilalai , Maai , Nethanel and Judah , Hanani , with the music-instruments of David , the man of God ; and Ezra the scribe was at their head ;
By the doorway of the fountain and straight in front of them , they went up by the steps of the town of David , at the slope up of the wall , over the house of David , as far as the water-doorway to the east .
The other band of those who gave praise went to the left , and I went after them with half the people , on the wall , over the tower of the ovens , as far as the wide wall ,
Over the Gate of Ephraim and by the old door and the fish door and the tower of Hananel and the tower of Hammeah , as far as the Sheep Gate : and at the doorway of the watchmen they came to a stop .
So the two bands of those who gave praise took up their positions in the house of God , and I and half of the chiefs with me :
The priests ; Eliakim , Maaseiah , Miniamin , Micaiah , Elioenai , Zechariah , and Hananiah , with wind instruments ;
And Maaseiah and Shemaiah and Eleazar and Uzzi and Jehohanan and Malchijah and Elam and Ezer . The makers of melody made their voices loud , with Jezrahiah their overseer .
On that day they made great offerings and were glad . God made them glad with great joy . The women and the children were glad with them . The joy of Jerusalem came to the ears of those who were far off .
Men were stationed over the houses where the contributions and the first fruits and the tenths were stored . They were to take into them the amounts , from the fields of every town . The law fixed this for the priests and the Levites : Judah was glad on account of the priests and the Levites who were in their places .
They kept the watch of their God , and were responsible for making things clean . So did the music-makers and the gatekeepers , as David and Solomon his son ordered it .
For in the days of David and Asaph in the past , there was a master of the music , and songs of blessing and praise to God .
All Israel in the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah gave what the music-makers and the gatekeepers deeded day by day . They made the offerings holy for the Levites ; and the Levites did the same for the sons of Aaron .
On that day there was a reading from the book of Moses while the people listened . They heard that it said in the book that no Ammonite or Moabite might ever come into the meeting of God at any time .
This is because they did not give the children of Israel bread and water when they came to them , but got Balaam to put a curse on them . Our God turned the curse into a blessing .
So after hearing the law , they took out of Israel all the mixed people .
Before this , Eliashib the priest had been placed over the rooms of the house of our God . He was a friend of Tobiah .
Had made a great room ready for him . This is where they once kept the meal offerings , the perfume , the vessels and the tenths of the grain and wine and oil . They were given by order to the Levites and the music-makers and the gatekeepers , and the contributions for the priests .
I was not at Jerusalem all this time in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes , king of Babylon . I went to the king ; and after some days , I got the king to let me go .
I went to Jerusalem . It was clear to me what evil Eliashib had done for Tobiah by making ready for him a room in the buildings of the house of God .
It was evil in my eyes so I had all Tobiah's things removed from the room .
Then I gave orders , and they made the rooms clean . I put the vessels of the House of God , along with the meal offerings and the perfume , back in the rooms .
I saw that the Levites had not been given what was needed for their support . So the Levites and the music-makers , who did the work , had gone away , everyone to his field .
Then I made protests to the chiefs , and said : » Why has the house of God been given up ? « I got them together and put them in their places .
All Judah came with the tenth part of the grain and wine and oil and put it into the storehouses .
I made controllers over the storehouses , Shelemiah the priest and Zadok the scribe , and of the Levites , Pedaiah : and with them was Hanan , the son of Zaccur the son of Mattaniah . They were taken to be honest men and their business was the distribution of these things to their brothers .
Nehemiah’s prayer : » Keep me in mind , O my God , in connection with this , and do not let the good which I have done for the house of my God and its worship go from your memory completely . «
In those days , I saw in Judah some who were crushing grapes on the Sabbath , and harvesting grain and putting it on Asses ; as well as wine and grapes and figs and all sorts of goods that they took into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day . I gave witness against them on the day when they were marketing food .
There were men of Tyre there . They came with fish and all sorts of goods , trading with the children of Judah and in Jerusalem on the Sabbath .
Then I made protests to the chiefs of Judah , and said to them : » What is this evil you are doing , not keeping the Sabbath day holy ?
» Did not your fathers do the same , and did not our God send all this evil on us and on this town ? You are causing more anger to come on Israel by not keeping the Sabbath holy . «
When the streets of Jerusalem were getting dark before the Sabbath , I gave orders for the gate to be shut and not to be open again until after the Sabbath . I put some of my servants by the gate so that nothing might be taken in on the Sabbath day .
So the traders in all sorts of goods took their night's rest outside Jerusalem once or twice .
Then I gave witness against them and said : » Why are you waiting all night by the wall ? If you do so again I will have you taken prisoners . « From that time they did not come again on the Sabbath .
I gave the Levites orders to make themselves clean and come and keep the gates and make the Sabbath holy . » Keep this in mind to my credit , O my God , and have mercy on me , for great is your mercy . «
I saw the Jews who were married to women of Ashdod and Ammon and Moab :
Their children were talking half in the language of Ashdod ; they had no knowledge of the Jews' language , but made use of the language of the two peoples .
I took up the cause against them , cursing them and giving blows to some of them and pulling out their hair . I made them take an oath by God , saying : » You are not to give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves .
» Was it not in these things that Solomon , king of Israel , did wrong ? Among a number of nations there was no king like him . He was dear to his God , and God made him king over all Israel . But even he was made to do evil by strange women .
» Are we then without protest to let you do all this great evil , sinning against our God by taking strange women for your wives ? «
One of the sons of Joiada , the son of Eliashib , the chief priest , was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite , so I sent him away from me .
» Keep them in mind , O my God , because they have put shame on the priests' name and on the agreement of the priests and the Levites . «
I made them clean from all strange people . Regular watches were fixed for the priests and for the Levites , everyone in his work .
» And for the wood offering , at fixed times , and for the first fruits . Keep me in mind , O my God , for good . «
Now it came about in the days of Ahasuerus , that Ahasuerus who was ruler of a hundred and twenty-seven divisions of the kingdom , from India as far as Ethiopia :
When King Ahasuerus was ruling in Shushan , his strong town ,
In the third year of his rule he gave a feast to all his captains and his servants . The captains of the army of Persia and Media , the great men and the rulers of the divisions of his kingdom , were present before him .
For a long time , even a hundred and eighty days , he let them see all the wealth and the glory of his kingdom and the great power and honor that was his .
At the end of that time , the king gave a feast for all the people who were present in Shushan , the king's town , small as well as great , for seven days , in the outer square of the garden of the king's house .
There were hangings of white and green and blue , fixed with cords of purple and the best cotton linen to silver rings and pillars of polished stone . The seats were of gold and silver on a floor of red and white and yellow and black stone .
They served drinks in gold vessels . Every vessel was different . The king freely gave wine from the kingdom .
The drinking was in keeping with the law . No one was forced : for the king gave orders to all the chief servants of his house to do as was pleasing to every man .
Vashti the queen gave a feast for the women in the house of King Ahasuerus .
On the seventh day , when the heart of the king was glad with wine , he gave orders to Mehuman , Biztha , Harbona , Bigtha , and Abagtha , Zethar , and Carcas , the seven eunuchs who served in the presences of King Ahasuerus .
That Vashti the queen was to come before him , with her royal crown , and let the people and the captains see her beauty : for she was very beautiful .
But when the servants gave her the king's order , Vashti the queen said she would not come . The king was very angry . His heart was burning with wrath .
The king spoke to the wise men that were experts with knowledge of the times . It was the king's practice .
The closest to the king were Carshena , Shethar , Admatha , Tarshish , Meres , Marsena , and Memucan , the seven rulers of Persia and Media . They were friends of the king , and had the first places in the kingdom .
» By law , what is to be done to Vashti the queen ? She has not done what King Ahasuerus ordered her to do . «
Before the king and the captains , Memucan gave his answer : » Vashti the queen has done wrong , not only to the king , but also to all the captains and to all the peoples in all the divisions of the kingdom of King Ahasuerus .
» For news of what the queen has done will come to the attention of all women . They will no longer give respect to their husbands when it is said to them , ‘ King Ahasuerus gave orders for Vashti the queen to come before him and she did not come . ’
» The wives of the captains of Persia and Media , hearing what the queen has done , will say the same to all the king's captains . So there will be much shame and anger .
» If it is pleasing to the king , let an order go out from him . Let it be recorded among the laws of the Persians and the Medes , so that it may never be changed . That Vashti is never again to come before King Ahasuerus . Let the king give her place to another who is better than she .
» When the king’s order is made public through all his great kingdom all the wives will give honor to their husbands , great as well as small . «
This suggestion seemed good to the king and the captains . The king did as Memucan said .
He sent letters to all the divisions of the kingdom where their language is used . The letter said that every man was to be the ruler in his house , and that this order was to be given out in the language of his people .
When the king's rage subsided , the thought of Vashti and what she had done and the order he had made against her came back to his mind .
Then the servants who were waiting on the king said to him , » Let a search be made for some fair young virgins for the king .
» Let the king give authority to some men in all the divisions of his kingdom , to get together all the fair young virgins and send them to Shushan , the king's town . Send them to the women's house . This is under the care of Hegai , the king's servant , the keeper of the women . Let the things needed for making them clean be given to them .
» And let the girl who is pleasing to the king be queen in place of Vashti . « The king was pleased with this suggestion ; and he did so .
There was a Jew in Shushan named Mordecai , the son of Jair , the son of Shimei , the son of Kish , a Benjamite .
He had been taken away from Jerusalem among those who had been made prisoner with Jeconiah , king of Judah , when Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , had taken him away .
And he had been a father to Hadassah who is Esther , the daughter of his father's brother : for she had no father or mother . When her father and mother were dead , Mordecai took her for his daughter . She was very beautiful .
When the order made by the king was made public a number of girls were placed in the care of Hegai in the king's house in Shushan . Esther was taken to the king's house and put in the care of Hegai , the keeper of the women .
He was pleased with the girl and was kind to her . He quickly provided her with cosmetics and food . He gave her seven choice servant girls who were to be hers from the king's house . He had her and her servant-girls moved to the best place in the women's part of the house .
Esther had not said what family or people she came from , for Mordecai gave her orders not to do so .
Every day Mordecai took his walk before the square of the women's house , to see how Esther was and what would be done to her .
Now every girl , when her turn came , had to go in to King Ahasuerus . After undergoing , for a space of twelve months , what was ordered by the law for the women for this was the time necessary for making them clean , that is , six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet perfumes and such things as are needed for making women clean .
In this way the girl was presented to the king . Whatever she desired was given to her to take with her from the women's house into the house of the king .
In the evening she went , and in the morning she would return to the second house of the women , to the custody of Shaashgaz , one of the king's eunuchs who had the care of the king's wives . If the king had delight in her and sent for her by name she would go to him again .
When the time came for Esther , the daughter of Abihail , his father's brother , whom Mordecai had taken as his daughter , to go in to the king , she made request for nothing but what Hegai , the king's servant and keeper of the women , had given her . And all who saw her looked on Esther kindly .
Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus in his house in the tenth month , which is the month Tebeth , in the seventh year of his rule .
Esther was more pleasing to the king than all the women . To his eyes she was fairer and more full of grace than all the other virgins . So he put his crown on her head and made her queen in place of Vashti .
The king gave a great feast for all his captains and his servants and Esther . He gave orders through all the divisions of his kingdom for a release amnesty day of rest to the provinces , and gave wealth from his store .
When the virgins came together in the second house of the women , Mordecai took his seat in the gate of the king's house .
Esther had still said nothing of her family or her people , as Mordecai had given her orders . Esther did what Mordecai said , as when she was living with him .
In those days , while Mordecai was seated at the king's gate two of the king's servants , Bigthan and Teresh , keepers of the gate , being angry , looked for a chance to attack King Ahasuerus .
Mordecai had knowledge of their purpose and sent word of it to Esther the queen . Esther gave the news to the king in Mordecai's name .
It was investigated and found to be true . The two men were put to death by hanging on a tree : and it was recorded in the records before the king .
The king ordered that Haman , the son of Hammedatha the Agagite , was lifted up and given a position of honor and a higher place than all the other captains who were with him .
All the king's servants who were in the king's house went down to the earth before Haman and gave him honor just as the king ordered . But Mordecai did not go down before him or give him honor .
Then the king's servants in the king's house said to Mordecai , » Why do you go against the king's order ? «
Now when they repeatedly said this to him day after day and he gave no attention , they told Haman about it . To see if Mordecai's behavior would be overlooked : for he said to them that he was a Jew .
Haman saw that Mordecai did not go before him and give him honor . Haman was very angry .
But it was not enough for him to attack Mordecai only . They made clear to him who Mordecai's people were . So Haman made it his purpose to put an end to all the Jews , even Mordecai's people , through all the kingdom of Ahasuerus .
In the first month , the month Nissan , in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus , from day to day and from month to month they went on looking for a sign given by Pur that is chance before Haman , till the sign came out for the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , the month Adar .
Haman said to King Ahasuerus , » There is a nation living here and there in small groups among the people in all the divisions of your kingdom . Their laws are different from those of any other nation . They do not keep the king's laws . For this reason it is not right for the king to let them be .
» If it is the king's pleasure , let a statement ordering their destruction be put in writing . I will give to those responsible for the king's business , ten thousand talents of silver for the king's storehouse . «
The king took his ring from his hand and gave it to Haman , the son of Hammedatha the Agagite , the hater of the Jews .
The king said to Haman : » The money is yours , and the people , to do with them whatever seems right to you . «
Then on the thirteenth day of the first month , the king's scribes were summoned . They put in writing Haman's orders to all the king's captains and the rulers of every division of his kingdom and the chiefs of every people . It was to be for every division of the kingdom in the writing commonly used there , and to every people in the language which was theirs . It was signed in the name of King Ahasuerus and stamped with the king's ring .
Runners delivered letters to every division of the kingdom . They ordered the death and destruction of all Jews , young and old , little children and women , on the same day , even the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , the month Adar , and the taking of all their goods by force .
A copy of the writing , to be made public in every part of the kingdom , was sent out to all the peoples , so that they might be ready when that day came .
The runners went out quickly with the king's order . A public statement was made in Shushan . The king and Haman took wine together , but the town of Shushan was troubled .
When Mordecai learned what had been done , he tore his clothes in anguish . Then he dressed in sackcloth , covered his head with ashes , and walked through the city , wailing loudly and bitterly ,
until he came to the entrance of the palace . He did not go in because no one wearing sackcloth was allowed inside .
Throughout all the provinces , wherever the king's proclamation was made known , there was loud mourning among the Jews . They fasted , wept , wailed , and most of them put on sackcloth and lay in ashes .
Esther's women and her servants came and gave her word of it . The queen’s grief was great indeed . She sent robes for Mordecai , so that his clothing of haircloth might be taken off ; but he would not wear them .
Then Esther sent for Hathach , one of the king's eunuchs whom he had given her to wait on her . She gave him orders to go to Mordecai and see what this was and why it was .
So Hathach went out and saw Mordecai in the open square of the town before the king's gate .
Mordecai gave him an account of what had taken place . He told about the amount of money that Haman said he would put in the king's store for the destruction of the Jews .
He gave him the copy of the order that was given in Shushan for their destruction . He ordered him to let Esther see it , and to make it clear to her . To say to her that she was to go in to the king to request his mercy and make prayer for her people .
Hathach returned and gave Esther an account of what Mordecai said .
Then Esther sent Hathach to say to Mordecai :
» It is common knowledge among all the king's servants and the people of every part of the kingdom , that if anyone , man or woman , comes to the king in his inner room without being sent for , there is only one law for him , that he is to be put to death . Only those to whom the king's rod of gold is stretched out may keep their lives . I have not been sent for to come before the king in the past thirty days . «
They conveyed this message to Mordecai .
Mordecai sent this answer back to Esther : » Do not have the idea that you in the king's house will be safe from the fate of all the Jews .
» If at this time you say nothing . Then help and salvation will come to the Jews from some other place . But you and your father's family will come to destruction . Who is to say that you have not come to the kingdom even for such a time as this ? «
Esther sent them back to Mordecai with this answer :
» Go assemble all the Jews who are present in Shushan , and fast for me . Take no food or drink night or day for three days . My women and I will do the same . Then I will go in to the king even though it is against the law . If death is to be my fate , then let it come . «
So Mordecai went away and did everything that Esther said .
Esther put on her queen's robes on the third day and took her place in the inner room of the king's house , facing the king's house . The king was seated on his high seat in the king's house , facing the doorway of the house .
When the king saw Esther the queen waiting in the inner room , looking kindly on her he put out the rod of gold in his hand to her . So Esther came near and put her fingers on top of the rod .
The king said : » What is your desire , Queen Esther , and what is your request ? I will give it to you , even to the half of my kingdom . «
Esther answered him : » If it seems good to the king , let the king and Haman come today to the feast I have made ready for him . «
Then the king said , » Let Haman come quickly , so that what Esther said may be done . « So the king and Haman went to the feast Esther prepared .
While they were drinking wine the king said to Esther : » What is your prayer ? For it will be given to you . What is your request ? For it will be done , even to the half of my kingdom . «
Esther answered : » My prayer and my request is this :
» ‘ If I have the king's approval , and if it is the king's pleasure to give me my prayer and do my request , let the king and Haman come to the feast that I will make ready for them . Tomorrow I will do as the king has said . ’ «
Then on that day Haman went out full of joy and glad in heart . When he saw Mordecai in the king's gate and he did not get to his feet or give any sign of fear before him , Haman was full of wrath against Mordecai .
But controlling himself , he went to his house ; and he sent for his friends and Zeresh , his wife .
He gave them an account of the glories of his wealth . The number of children he had . He recalled the ways in which he had been honored by the king . How the king put him over the captains and servants of the king .
Haman continued : » Truly , Esther the queen let no man but myself come in to the feast she made ready for the king . Tomorrow again I am to be her guest with the king .
» But all this is nothing to me as long as I see Mordecai the Jew seated by the king's gate . «
Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him : » Let a pillar , fifty cubits high , be made ready for hanging him . In the morning get the king to give orders for the hanging of Mordecai . Then you will be able to go to the feast with the king with a glad heart . « Haman was pleased with the suggestion , and he had the pillar made .
That night the king was unable to get any sleep . He sent for the books of the records and had some one was read them to him .
It was recorded in the book how Mordecai had given word of the designs of Bigthana and Teresh , two of the king's servants , keepers of the gate who conspired to kill the king .
The king said : » What honor and reward have been given to Mordecai for this ? « The servants waiting on the king said : » Nothing has been done for him . «
The king asked : » Who is in the outer room ? « Haman came into the outer room to get the king's authority for the hanging of Mordecai on the pillar that he made ready for him .
The king's servants said : » Haman is waiting in the outer room . « The king said : » Let him come in . «
So Haman came in . And the king said to him : » What is to be done to the man whom the king has delight in honoring ? « Then the thought came into Haman's mind , whom , more than myself , would the king have pleasure in honoring ?
Haman answered : » For the man whom the king has delight in honoring ,
» Let them take the robes that the king generally puts on , and the horse on which the king goes , and the crown that is on his head :
» And let the robes and the horse be given to one of the king's most noble captains , so that they may put them on the man whom the king has delight in honoring . Let him go on horseback through the streets of the town , with men crying out before him . So let it be done to the man whom the king has delight in honoring . «
Then the king said to Haman : » Go quickly , and take the robes and the horse , as you have said , and do even so to Mordecai the Jew , who is seated at the king's gate . See that you do everything as you have said . «
Haman took the robes and the horse , and dressing Mordecai in the robes , he made him go on horseback through the streets of the town , crying out before him : » So let it be done to the man whom the king has delight in honoring . «
Mordecai came back to the king's gate . But Haman went quickly back to his house , sad and with his head covered .
And Haman gave his wife Zeresh and all his friends an account of what took place . Then his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him , » If Mordecai , who is starting to get the better of you , is of the seed of the Jews , you will not be able to do anything against him , but you will certainly go down before him . «
While they were still talking , the king's servants came to take Haman to the feast that Esther made ready .
The king and Haman came to dine with queen Esther .
The king said to Esther again on the second day , while they were drinking : » What is your petition , Queen Esther ? For it will be given to you . What is your request ? For it will be done , even to the half of my kingdom . «
Esther the queen , answered : » If I have your approval , O king , and if it is the king's pleasure , let my life be given to me in answer to my petition . My people at my request :
» For my people and I have been sold for slaughter and destruction . If we had been taken as men-servants and women-servants for a price , I would have said nothing , for our trouble is little in comparison with the king's loss . «
Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen : » Who is he and where is he who has had this evil thought in his heart ? «
Esther said : » Our hater and attacker is this evil Haman . « Then Haman was full of fear before the king and the queen .
The king in his anger got up from the feast and went into the garden . Haman got to his feet to plead to Esther the queen for his life . He saw that the king had already decided against him .
Then the king came back from the garden into the room where they had been drinking . Haman was stretched out on the seat where Esther was . Then the king said : » Is he taking the queen by force before my eyes in my house ? « While the words were on the king's lips , they put a cloth over Haman's face .
Then Harbonah , one of the court officials waiting before the king , said : » See , the pillar fifty cubits high , which Haman made for Mordecai , who said a good word for the king , is still in its place near Haman's house . « Then the king said : » Put him to death by hanging him on it . «
So Haman was put to death by hanging him on the pillar he made for Mordecai . Then the king's rage subsided .
That day the king gave all the estate of Haman , the hater of the Jews , to Esther the queen . And Mordecai came before the king , for Esther had made clear what he was to her .
The king took off his ring , which he had taken from Haman , and gave it to Mordecai . Esther put Mordecai over the family of Haman .
Then Esther again came before the king . She fell down at his feet and wept as she requested : that he would put a stop to the evil purposes of Haman the Agagite and the designs that he had made against the Jews .
Then the king extended the rod of gold to Esther and she stood before the king .
She said : » If it is the king's pleasure and if I have his approval and this thing seems right to the king and I am pleasing to him , then let letters be sent giving orders against those which Haman , the son of Hammedatha the Agagite , sent out for the destruction of the Jews in all divisions of the kingdom .
» For how can it be possible for me to see the evil that is to overtake my nation ? How may I see the destruction of my people ? «
Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew : » See now , I have given Esther the family of Haman , and he has come to his death by hanging , because he made an attack on the Jews .
» Send a letter about the Jews , writing whatever seems good to you , in the king's name , and stamp it with the king's ring : for a writing signed in the king's name and stamped with the king's ring may not be changed . «
Then at that time , on the twenty-third day of the third month , which is the month Sivan , the king's scribes were summoned . Everything ordered by Mordecai was put in writing and sent to the Jews and the captains and the rulers and the chiefs of all the divisions of the kingdom from India to Ethiopia , a hundred and twenty-seven divisions , to every division in the writing commonly used there , and to every people in their language , and to the Jews in their writing and their language .
The letters were sent in the name of King Ahasuerus and stamped with his ring , and they were taken by men on horseback , going on the quick-running horses used for the king's business , the offspring of his best horses :
In these letters the king gave authority to the Jews in every town to come together and make a fight for their lives . To send death and destruction on the power of any people in any part of the kingdom attacking them or their children or their women , and to take their goods from them by force .
On one day in every division of the kingdom of Ahasuerus , that is , on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , the month Adar .
A copy of the writing , to be made public as an order in every division of the kingdom , was given out to all the peoples , so that the Jews might be ready when that day came to give punishment to their enemies .
So the men went out on the quick-running horses used on the king's business . They wasted no time and forced on by the king's order ; and the order was given out in Shushan , the king's town .
Mordecai went out from before the king , dressed in king-like robes of blue and white , and with a great crown of gold and clothing of purple and the best linen . The entire town of Shushan gave loud cries of joy .
It was a time of happiness joy and honor for the Jews .
And in every part of the kingdom and in every town , wherever the king's letter and his order came , the Jews were glad with great joy . They had a feast and a good day . A large number of the people of the land became Jews : for the fear of the Jews had come on them .
Now on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , which is the month Adar , when the time came for the king's order to be put into effect , on the very day when the enemies of the Jews hoped to rule over them the opposite occurred , and the Jews had rule over their enemies .
On that day , the Jews came together in their towns through all the divisions of the kingdom of Ahasuerus , for the purpose of attacking all those who were attempting evil against them . Everyone had to give way before them . All the people feared them .
And all the chiefs and the captains and the rulers and those who did the king's business supported the Jews because the fear of Mordecai had come on them .
For Mordecai was great in the king's house . Word about him went out through every part of the kingdom : for the man Mordecai became greater and greater .
So the Jews overcame all their attackers with the sword and with death and destruction , and did to their enemies whatever they had a desire to do .
The Jews put to death five hundred men in Shushan .
They put to death Parshandatha , Dalphon , Aspatha ,
Poratha , Adalia , Aridatha ,
Parmashta , Arisai , Aridai , and Vajezatha ,
The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha , the hater of the Jews ; but they put not a hand on any of their goods .
On that day the number of those who had been put to death in the town of Shushan was given to the king .
The king said to Esther the queen : » The Jews have put five hundred men to death in Shushan , as well as the ten sons of Haman . What then have they done in the rest of the kingdom ! Now what is your petition ? For it will be given to you . What other request have you ? And it will be done . «
Then Esther said : » If it is the king's pleasure , let authority be given to the Jews in Shushan to do tomorrow as has been done today , and let orders be given for the hanging of Haman's ten sons . «
The king said that this was to be done , and the order was given out in Shushan . The hanging of Haman's ten sons was carried out .
The Jews who were in Shushan came together again on the fourteenth day of the month Adar and put to death three hundred men in Shushan . They did not take their material goods .
The other Jews in every division of the kingdom came together , fighting for their lives , and got salvation from their enemies and put seventy-five thousand of them to death . They did not put a hand on their material goods .
This they did on the thirteenth day of the month Adar ; and on the fourteenth day of the same month they took their rest , and made it a day of feasting and joy .
The Jews in Shushan came together on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth day of the month . On the fifteenth day they took their rest , and made it a day of feasting and joy .
So the Jews of the country places living in unwalled towns make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of feasting and joy and a good day , a day for sending offerings one to another .
Mordecai sent letters to all the Jews in every division of the kingdom of Ahasuerus , near and far .
He ordered them to keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar and the fifteenth day of the same month , every year .
As days on which the Jews had rest from their haters , and the month which for them was turned from sorrow to joy , and from weeping to a good day : and that they were to keep them as days of feasting and joy , of sending offerings to one another and good things to the poor .
The Jews gave their word to go on as they had been doing and as Mordecai had given them orders in writing .
Because Haman , the son of Hammedatha the Agagite , the hater of all the Jews , conspired for their destruction , attempting to get a decision by Pur that is , chance with a view to putting an end to them and cutting them off .
But when the business was put before the king , he gave orders by letters that the evil design that he had made against the Jews was to be turned against him . That he and his sons were to be put to death by hanging .
So these days were named Purim , after the name of Pur . And so , because of the words of this letter , and of what they had seen in connection with this business , and what had come to them ,
The Jews made a rule and established a custom that all their descendents should observe two days every year as ordered in the letter , at the fixed time every year .
Those days were to be kept in memory through every generation and every family , in every division of the kingdom and every town , that there might never be a time when these days of Purim would not be kept among the Jews , or when the memory of them would go from the minds of their descendents .
Esther the queen , daughter of Abihail , and Mordecai the Jew , sent a second letter giving the force of their authority to the order about the Purim .
He sent letters to all the Jews in the hundred and twenty-seven divisions of the kingdom of Ahasuerus , with true words of peace ,
Giving the force of law to these days of Purim at their fixed times , as they had been ordered by Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen . This was in keeping with the rules they had made for themselves and their descendents , in connection with their time of going without food and their cry for help .
The order given by Esther gave the force of law to the rules about the Purim . It was recorded in the book .
King Ahasuerus put a tax on the land and on the islands of the sea .
And all his acts of power and his great strength and the full story of the high place that the king gave Mordecai are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Media and Persia ?
For Mordecai the Jew was second only to King Ahasuerus . He was great among the Jews and respected by the body of his countrymen . He worked for the good of his people . He said words of peace to all his descendents .
A man named Job lived in Uz . He was a man of integrity ! He was decent , he respected God , and he stayed away from evil .
He had seven sons and three daughters .
He owned seven thousand sheep , three thousand camels , one thousand head of cattle , and five hundred donkeys . He also had a large number of servants . In fact he was the greatest richest of all the Orientals in the East !
Job's sons used to take turns giving a feast . They invited many others to come , and they always invited their three sisters to join them .
The morning after each feast , Job would get up early to offer sacrifices for each of his children in order to purify them . He always did this because he thought that one of them might have sinned by insulting God unintentionally .
The day came when heavenly beings appeared before Jehovah . Satan was there among them .
Jehovah asked him : » What have you been doing ? « Satan answered : » I have been walking here and there and roaming around the earth . «
» Did you notice my servant Job ? « Jehovah asked . » There is no one on earth as faithful and good as he is . He respects me and is careful not to do anything evil . «
Satan replied : » Would Job respect you if he got nothing out of it ?
» You have always protected him and his family and everything he owns . You bless everything he does . You have given him enough cattle to fill the whole country .
» Now suppose you take away everything he has . He will curse you to your face ! «
» All right , « Jehovah said to Satan , » everything he has is in your power , but you must not hurt Job ! « So Satan left .
One day when Job's children were having a feast at the home of their oldest brother ,
a messenger came running to Job . » We were plowing the fields with the cattle , « he said , » and the donkeys were in a nearby pasture .
» Suddenly the Sabeans attacked and stole them all . They killed every one of your servants except me . I am the only one who escaped to tell you . «
Before he finished speaking , another servant came and said : » Lightning struck the sheep and the shepherds and killed them all . I am the only one who escaped to tell you . «
Before he finished speaking , another servant came and said : » Three bands of Chaldean raiders attacked us . They took away the camels and killed all your servants except me . I am the only one who escaped to tell you . «
No sooner had he finished speaking , then another servant came and said : » Your children were having a feast at the home of your oldest son ,
when a storm swept in from the desert . It blew the house down and killed them all . I am the only one who escaped to tell you . «
Then Job got up and tore his clothes in grief . He shaved his head and threw himself face down on the ground .
He said : » I was born with nothing naked , and I will die with nothing . Jehovah gave , and now he has taken away . Blessed be the name of Jehovah ! «
In spite of everything that had happened , Job did not sin by blaming God .
One day when the sons of God came to present themselves in front of Jehovah , Satan the Accuser came along with them .
Jehovah asked Satan : » Where have you come from ? Satan replied to Jehovah : From wandering all over the earth . «
Jehovah asked Satan : » Have you thought about my servant Job ? No one in the world is like him ! He is a man of integrity ! He is decent and he respects God . He stays away from evil . And he still holds on to his principles . You are trying to provoke me into ruining him for no reason . «
Satan answered Jehovah : » Skin for skin ! Certainly , a man will give everything he has for his life .
» But stretch out your hand , and strike his flesh and bones and he will curse you to your face ! «
Jehovah told Satan : » He is in your power , but you must spare his life ! «
Satan left Jehovah’s presence and struck Job with painful boils from the bottom of his feet to the top of his head .
Job took a piece of broken pottery to scratch his sores as he sat in the ashes .
His wife asked him : » Are you still holding on to your principles ? Curse God and die ! «
He said to her : » You are talking like a godless fool . We accept the good that God gives us . Should we not also accept the bad ? « Through all this Job did not speak sinful words .
Job's three friends heard about all the terrible things that happened to him . Each of them came from his home : Eliphaz of Teman , Bildad of Shuah , and Zophar of Naama . They agreed they would go together to sympathize with Job and comfort him .
They saw him from a distance and did not even recognize him . They cried out loud and wept . Each of them tore his clothes in grief . They threw dust on their heads .
Then they sat down on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights . No one said a word to him because they saw that he was in such great pain .
JOB OPENED HIS MOUTH and cursed the day of his birth .
He said :
» May the day of my birth perish , and the night it was said : ‘ A boy is born ! ’ «
» Let that day turn to darkness . May God above not care about it . Let no light shine upon it .
» Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it once more . May a cloud settle over it and may blackness overwhelm its light .
» About that night , may thick darkness seize it . May it not be included among the days of the year nor be entered in any of the months .
» Let the night be barren and may no shout of joy be heard in it .
» May those who curse days curse that day , those who are ready to lift up Leviathan Babylonian symbol of sadness and mourning .
» Let its morning stars become dark and cause it to wait for daylight in vain and not see the first rays of dawn ,
for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me to hide trouble from my eyes .
» Why did I not perish at birth , and die as I came from the womb ?
» Why were there knees to receive me and breasts that I might be nursed ?
» For now I would be lying down in peace . I would be asleep and at rest .
» I would be with kings and counselors of the earth , who built for themselves places now lying in ruins .
» I would be with rulers who had gold , who filled their houses with silver .
» Why was I not hidden in the ground like a stillborn child , like an infant who never saw the light of day ?
» There the wicked cease from turmoil , and there the weary are at rest .
» Captives also enjoy their ease ; they no longer hear the slave driver’s shout .
» The small and the great are there . The slave is freed from his master .
» Why is light given to those in misery , and life to the bitter in heart ?
» They long for death that does not come . They search for it more than for hidden treasure .
» They are filled with gladness and rejoice when they reach the grave .
» Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden , whom God has hedged fenced in ?
» Sighing comes to me instead of food . My groans pour out like water .
» What I feared has come upon me . What I dreaded has happened to me .
» I have no peace . I have no quietness . I have no rest . I only have turmoil ! «
ELIPHAZ THE TEMANITE REPLIED TO JOB :
» If someone tries to talk to you , will you become impatient ? But who can keep from talking ?
» Look , you have instructed many people . When hands were weak , you made them strong .
» When someone stumbled , you lifted him up with your words . When knees were weak , you gave them strength .
» But trouble comes to you , and you are impatient . It touches you , and you panic .
» Does your respect for God give you confidence and your lifetime of integrity give you hope ?

So these three men ceased to answer Job , because he was righteous in his own eyes .
Then Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite , of the family of Ram , became angry . He was angry with Job because he justified himself rather than God .
He was angry also with Job’s three friends because they found no answer , though they had declared Job to be in the wrong .
Elihu waited to speak to Job , because they were older than he .
When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouths of these three men , he became angry .
Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite answered : » I am young in years , and you are aged ; therefore I was timid and afraid to declare my opinion to you .
» I said : ‘ Let days speak , and many years teach wisdom . ’
» But truly it is the spirit in a man , the breath of the Almighty that makes for understanding .
» It is not the old that are wise , nor the aged that understand what is right .
» Therefore I tell you : ‘ Listen to me ! Let me also declare my opinion . ’
» Listen ! I waited for your words . I listened for your wise sayings , while you determined what to say .
» I gave you my attention , but there was in fact no one that disproved Job , no one among you that answered his words .
» Yet do not say : ‘ We have found wisdom ; God may vanquish him , not a human . ’
» He has not directed his words against me . I will not answer him with your speeches .
» They are dismayed and they answer no more . They do not have a word to say .
» Should I wait , because they do not speak , because they stand there , and answer no more ?
» I also will give my answer . I also will declare my opinion .
» For I am full of words but the spirit within me constrains me .
» My heart is indeed like wine that has no vent . It is like new wineskins and is ready to burst .
» I must speak so that I may find relief . I must open my lips and answer .
» I will not show partiality to any person or use flattery toward anyone .
» I do not know how to flatter or my Maker would soon put an end to me !
» Listen to my words Job . Pay attention to everything I say .
» I am about to open my mouth . My words are on the tip of my tongue .
» My words come from an upright heart ! My lips sincerely speak what I know .
» The Spirit of God has made me . The Breath of the Almighty gives me life .
» Answer me then , if you can , and prepare yourself to confront me .
» I am just like you before God . I too have been taken from clay !
» No fear of me should alarm you , nor should my hand be heavy upon you .
» You have said in my hearing , I heard the very words :
» I am pure and without sin ! I am clean and free from guilt .
» Yet God has found fault with me . He considers me his enemy !
» He fastens my feet in shackles and he keeps close watch on all my paths .
» But I tell you , Job , in this you are not right , for God is greater than man .
» Why do you complain to him that he answers none of man’s words ?
» God does speak , now one-way and then another , though man may not perceive it .
» In a dream , in a vision of the night , when deep sleep falls on men as they slumber in their beds ,
he may speak in their ears and terrify them with warnings ,
that turn man from wrongdoing and keep him from pride .
» It is to preserve him from the pit and keep his life from perishing by the sword .
» On the other hand a man may be chastened on a bed of pain with constant distress in his bones .
» His very being finds food repulsive and he loathes the choicest meal .
» His flesh wastes away to nothing , and his bones , once hidden , now stick out .
» He draws near to the pit and to the messengers of death .
» Yet if there is an angel on his side as a mediator , one out of a thousand , to tell a man what is right for him ,
to be gracious to him and say : ‘ Spare him from going down to the pit . I have found a ransom for him ! ’
» His flesh is renewed like a child’s . It is restored as in the days of his youth .
» He prays to God and finds favor with him . He sees God’s face and shouts for joy ! God restores him to his righteous state .
» He comes to men and says : ‘ I sinned , and perverted what was right , but I did not get what I deserved . ’
» He redeemed me from going down to the pit , and I will live to enjoy the light .
» God does all these things to a man twice , even three times .
» He turns him back from the pit that the light of life may shine on him .
» Pay attention , Job , and listen to me ! Be silent , and I will speak .
» If you have anything to say answer me . Speak up , for I want you to be cleared .
» But if not , then listen to me . Be silent , and I will teach you wisdom .

» God's eyes are on a person's ways . He sees all his steps .
There is no darkness or deep shadow where troublemakers can hide .
» He does not have to set a time for a person in order to bring him to divine judgment .
» He breaks mighty people into pieces without examining them and puts others in their places .
» He knows what they do , so he overthrows them at night , and they are crushed .
» In return for their evil , he strikes them in public .
» This is because they turned away from following him . They did not consider any of his ways .
» They forced the poor to cry out to him , and he hears the cry of those who suffer .
» If God decided to do nothing at all , no one could criticize him . If he hid his face refused to assist , we would be helpless .
» There would be nothing that nations could do to keep godless oppressors from ruling them .
» Job , have you confessed your sins to God and promised not to sin again ?
» Have you asked God to show you your faults , and have you agreed to stop doing evil ?
» Since you object to what God does , can you expect him to do what you want ? The decision is yours , not mine . Tell us now what you think .
» Any sensible person will agree ; and the wise that hear me will say
that Job is speaking from ignorance and that nothing he says make sense .
» Think through everything that Job says . You will see that he talks like an evil man .
» To his sins he adds rebellion and in front of us all he mocks God .
ELIHU CONTINUED :
» Do you think this to be just ? You say : ‘ I am in the right before God . ’
» If you ask : ‘ What advantage do I have ? How am I better off than if I had sinned ? ’
» I will answer you and your friends with you .
Look at the heavens , observe the clouds and see . They are higher than you .
» If you have sinned , what do you accomplish against him ? If your transgressions are multiplied , what do you do to him ?
» If you are righteous , what do you give to him ? What does he receive from your hand ?
» Your wickedness affects others like you , and your righteousness , other human beings .
» Because of the multitude of oppressions people cry out . They call for help because of the arm of the mighty .
» However no one says : ‘ Where is God my Maker , who gives strength in the night ? ’
» Who teaches us more than the animals of the earth , and makes us wiser than the birds of the air ?
» They cry out , but he does not answer , because of the pride of evildoers .
» Surely God does not hear an empty cry , nor does the Almighty regard it .
» How much less when you say that you do not see him , that the case is before him , and you are waiting for him !
» Because his anger does not punish , and he does not greatly heed transgression ,
» Job opens his mouth in empty talk . He multiplies words without knowledge . «
ELIHU TALKS EVEN MORE :
» Bear with me a little longer and I will show you that there is more to be said in God’s behalf .
» I get my knowledge from afar . I ascribe justice to my Maker .
» Be assured that my words are not false ! One who is perfect in knowledge is with you .
» God is mighty , but does not despise men . He is mighty in strength of understanding .
» He does not keep the wicked alive but gives the afflicted their rights .
» He does not withdraw his eyes from the righteous . He enthrones them with kings and exalts them forever .
» But if men are bound in chains , held fast by cords of affliction ,
he tells them what they have done , that they have sinned arrogantly .
» He makes them listen to correction and commands them to repent of their evil .
» If they obey and serve him , they will spend the rest of their days in prosperity and their years in contentment .
» However if they do not obey , they will perish by the sword and die without knowledge .
» The godless in heart harbor resentment . Even when he fetters them , they do not cry for help .
» They die in their youth , among male prostitutes of the shrines .
» But those who suffer he delivers in their suffering ; he speaks to them in their affliction .
» He would bring you out of the jaws of distress to a spacious place free from restriction , to the comfort of your table laden with choice food .
» Now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked . Judgment and justice have taken hold of you .
» Be careful that no one entices you by riches . Do not let a large bribe turn you aside .
» Would your wealth or even all your mighty efforts sustain you so you would not be in distress ?
» Do not desire the night , to drag people away from their homes .
» Do not turn to evil . You seem to prefer evil to affliction .
» God is exalted in his power . Who is a teacher like him ?
» Who has prescribed his ways for him , or said to him : You have done wrong ?
» Remember to extol his work , which men have praised in song .
» All mankind has seen it . Men gaze on it from afar .
» How great is God ! He is beyond our understanding ! The number of his years is past finding out .
» He draws up drops of water , which distill as rain to the streams .
» The clouds pour down their moisture and abundant showers fall on mankind .
» Who can understand how he spreads out the clouds , how he thunders from his pavilion ?
« See how he scatters his lightning , bathing the depths of the sea .
» This is the way he governs the nations and provides food in abundance .
» He fills his hands with lightning and commands it to strike its mark .
» His thunder announces the coming storm . Even the cattle make known its approach .
» The storm makes my heart beat wildly .
» Listen ! All of you listen to the voice of God , to the thunder that comes from his mouth .
» He sends the lightning across the sky to the ends of the earth .
» He thunders with the roar of his voice ! It is like the majestic sound of thunder , and all the while the lightning flashes .
» At God's command amazing things happen , wonderful things that we cannot understand .
» He says to the snow : ‘ Fall on the earth . ’ ’ He says to the rain : ‘ Be strong . ’
» He seals the hand of every man and all men may know His work .
» Then the beast goes into its lair . It remains in its den .
» Out of the south come the storm , and out of the north the cold .
» Ice is made from the breath of God . It freezes the expanse of the waters .
» He loads the thick cloud with moisture and disperses with lighting .
» They swirl about on the face of the inhabited earth . They do whatever God commands .
» He causes it to happen for correction , for his land and for his loving kindness .
« Listen to this , O Job , Stand and consider the wonders of God .
» Do you know how God establishes them ? Do you know how he makes the lightning ?
» Do you know about the layers of thick clouds , the wonders of one perfect in knowledge ?
» You whose garments are hot , when the land is still because of the south wind ?
» Have you , like him , spread out the skies , strong as a cast metal mirror ?
» Teach us what we should say to him ! We can arrange nothing because of darkness .
» Shall it be told him that I would speak ? Or should a man say that he would be swallowed up ?
» Now men do not see the light that is bright in the skies when the wind passed and cleared them .
» Golden splendors come out of the north around God’s awesome majesty .
» We cannot find the Almighty . He is exalted in power but will not do violence to justice and abundant righteousness .
» Therefore men respect him ! He shows no partiality to the wise at heart . «

JEHOVAH SPEAKS TO JOB :
» Will the person who finds fault with the Almighty correct him ? Will the person who argues with God answer him ? «
JOB ANSWERED JEHOVAH :
» I am so insignificant . How can I answer you ? I will put my hand over my mouth .
I spoke once , but I cannot answer twice . I will proceed no further . «
He spoke out of a storm :
» Brace yourself like a man ! I will ask you , and you will teach me .
» Would you undo my justice ? Would you condemn me so that you can be righteous ?
» Do you have an arm power like God’s ? Can your voice thunder like his ?
» Then adorn yourself with glory and splendor . Clothe yourself in honor and majesty .
» Unleash the fury of your wrath , look at every proud man and bring him low !
» Look at every proud man and humble him , crush the wicked where they stand .
» Bury them all in the dust together and shroud their faces in the grave .
» I will admit to you then that your own right hand can save you .
» Look at the behemoth , which I made along with you . It feeds on grass as cattle do .
» What strength he has in his loins , what power in the muscles of his belly !
» His tail sways like a cedar ; the sinews of his thighs are close-knit .
» His bones are tubes of bronze , his limbs like rods of iron .
» He ranks first among the works of God , yet his Maker can approach him with his sword .
» The hills bring him their produce . All the wild animals play nearby .
» He lies under the lotus plants , hidden among the reeds in the marsh .
» The lotuses conceal him in their shadow . The poplars by the stream surround him .
» The river rages , but he is not alarmed . He is secure , though the Jordan should surge against his mouth .
» Can anyone capture him by the eyes , or trap him and pierce his nose ?
GOD CONTINUES TO QUESTION JOB :
» Can you catch Leviathan with a fishhook or tie his tongue down with a rope ?
» Can you put a rope through his snout or put a hook through his jaws ?
» Will he beg you to let him go ? Will he plead with you for mercy ?
» Will he make an agreement with you and promise to serve you forever ?
» Will you tie him like a pet bird , like something to amuse your servant women ?
» Will fishermen bargain over him ? Will merchants cut him up to sell ?
» Can you fill his hide with fishing spears or pierce his head with a harpoon ?
» Indeed , hope of overcoming him is false . Should you be overwhelmed at the sight of him ?
» No one is as fierce that he would dare stir him up . Who then is able to stand against me ?
» Who has preceded me that I should pay him ? Everything under heaven is mine .
» I will not conceal his limbs , his mighty power , or his graceful proportions .
» Who can remove his outer coat ? Who can approach him with a double bridle ?
» Who can open the doors of his face , with his terrible teeth all around ?
» His rows of scales are his pride , Shut up tightly as a seal .
» One is so near another that no air can come between them .
» They are joined one to another , they stick together and cannot be parted .

» In its neck abides strength , and terror dances before it .
» The folds of its flesh cling together ; it is firmly cast and immovable .
» Its heart is as hard as stone , as hard as the lower millstone .
» When it raises itself up the gods are afraid ; at the crashing they are beside themselves .
» Though the sword reaches it , it does not avail , nor does the spear , the dart , or the javelin .
» It considers iron to be like straw and bronze to be like rotten wood .
» An arrow will not make it run away . Stones from a sling turn to dust against it .
» It considers clubs to be like stubble , and it laughs at a rattling javelin .
» Its underside is like sharp pieces of broken pottery . It stretches out like a threshing sledge on the mud .
» It makes the deep sea boil like a pot . It stirs up the ocean like a boiling kettle .
» It leaves a shining path behind it so that the sea appears to have silvery hair .
» Nothing on land can compare to it . It was made fearless .
» It looks down on all high things . It is king of everyone who is arrogant .
JOB REPLIED TO JEHOVAH :
» I know that you can do all things and no plan of yours can be thwarted .
» You asked : ‘ Who is this that obscures my counsel without knowledge ? Surely I spoke of things I did not understand , things too wonderful for me to know . ’
» You said : ‘ Listen now , and I will speak . I will question you , and you shall answer me . ’
» My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you .
» Therefore I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes . «
» I am angry with you and your two friends , because you did not speak correctly about me , as my servant Job has .
» So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves . My servant Job will pray for you , and I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly . You did not speak correctly about me , as my servant Job has . «
So Eliphaz the Temanite , Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite did what Jehovah told them . And Jehovah accepted Job’s prayer .
After Job had prayed for his friends , Jehovah made him prosperous again and gave him twice as much as he had before .
All his brothers and sisters and everyone who had known him before came and ate with him in his house . They comforted and consoled him over all the trouble Jehovah allowed to come upon him . Each one gave him a piece of silver and a gold ring .
Jehovah blessed the latter part of Job’s life more than the first . He had fourteen thousand sheep , six thousand camels , a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand donkeys .
He also had seven sons and three daughters .
The first daughter he named Jemimah , the second Keziah and the third Keren-Happuch .
Nowhere in all the land were there found women as beautiful as Job’s daughters . Their father granted them an inheritance along with their brothers .
After this Job lived a hundred and forty years . He saw his children and their children to the fourth generation .
He died a very old man .
Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of the scornful mockers .
But his delight is in the law of Jehovah , and on his law he meditates ponders speaks softly with deep thought studies contemplates day and night .
He is like a tree planted by streams of water . It yields its fruit in season and its leaves do not wither . Whatever he does prospers .
This is not so for the wicked ! They are like chaff that the wind blows away .
Therefore the wicked will not stand be upright in the judgment . The sinners will not stand endure in the assembly of the righteous .
Jehovah knows is fully aware of the way of the righteous . But the way of the wicked will perish .
Why do the nations conspire together and rage ? Why do the peoples plot in vain ?
The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together against Jehovah and against his Anointed One .
They say : » Let us break their chains of control and throw off their oppressive rule . «
The One who dwells in heaven laughs . Jehovah scoffs at them .
Then he rebukes them in his anger and terrifies them in his rage fury . He says :
» I have installed anointed established my king on Zion , my holy mountain . «
I will proclaim the decree of Jehovah : He said to me : » You are my Son . Today I have become your Father . I have begotten you .
» Ask of me , and I will make the nations your inheritance , the ends of the earth your possession .
» You will rule them with an iron scepter . You will dash them to pieces like pottery ! «
Listen you kings , be wise show discernment and be warned you rulers of the earth .
Serve Jehovah with deep respect and rejoice with trembling .
Kiss the Son , lest he be angry and you be destroyed in your way , for his wrath can flare up in a moment . Blessed happy are all who take refuge put trust in him .
O Jehovah , look how my enemies have increased ! Many are attacking me .

Many are saying about me : » Even with God on his side , he will not have victory deliverance salvation . «
You , O Jehovah , are a protective shield over me . You are my glory . You hold my head high .
I call aloud to Jehovah . He answers me from his holy mountain .
I lie down and sleep . I wake up again because Jehovah continues to sustain me .
I am not afraid of the tens of thousands who have taken positions against me on all sides .
Arise , O Jehovah ! Save me , O my God ! You have slapped all my enemies in the face . You have broken the teeth of wicked people .
Salvation belongs to Jehovah ! You bless your people .
Answer me when I call , O God of my righteousness ! You have relieved me in my trouble . Have mercy on me and hear my prayer .

O sons of men , how long will my glorious honor be turned into shame ? How long will you love empty , worthless things and search for the lie ?
But know that Jehovah has chosen and distinguished the godly man for himself . Jehovah will hear when I call to him .
Tremble , stand in awe and do not sin ! Meditate in your heart upon your bed , and keep silent .
Offer the sacrifices of righteousness and trust in Jehovah .
Many are saying : » Who will show us good ? « Lift up the light of your countenance face presence upon us , O Jehovah !
You will put gladness joy in my heart . It will be more than when their grain and new wine abound .
In peace I will both lie down and sleep . For you alone , O Jehovah , make my dwelling safe and secure .
Listen to my words , O Jehovah , Consider my innermost thoughts .

Listen to the sound of my cry for help , my King and my God , for to you I pray .
In the morning , O Jehovah , You will hear my voice . In the morning I will address my prayer to you and be on the watch .
For you are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness . No evil dwells with you !
The arrogant shall not stand before your eyes . You hate all who practice sin .
You destroy those who speak falsehood . Jehovah abhors the man of bloodshed and deceit .
But as for me , by your abundant loving kindness I will enter your house . At Your holy temple I will bow in reverence of you .
O Jehovah , lead me in your righteousness because of my enemies . Make your way straight in my presence .
There is nothing truthful in what they say ! Their inward part is destruction . Their throat is an open grave . They flatter with their tongue .
Pronounce them guilty , O God . Let them fall by their own devices . In the multitude of their transgressions thrust them out , because they are rebellious against you .
But let all who take refuge in you rejoice . Let them ever sing for joy because you defend them . Let those who love your name exult in you .
You bless the righteous man , O Jehovah . You surround him with favor as with a shield .
O Jehovah , do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath .

Be merciful to me , Jehovah , for I am faint . O Jehovah , heal me , for my bones are in agony .
I am in anguish . How long , O Jehovah , how long ?
Return , O Jehovah , and deliver me . Save me because of your unfailing love .
No one remembers you when he is dead . Who praises you from the grave ?
I am worn out from groaning . All night long I flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears .
My eyes grow weak with sorrow . I am weak because of all my foes .
Depart from me , all you who do evil . Jehovah hears my weeping .
Jehovah hears my supplication for mercy . Jehovah receives my prayer !
All my enemies will be ashamed and dismayed . They will turn back in sudden disgrace .
O Jehovah my God , in you I take refuge ; save me from all my pursuers , and deliver me ,

or like a lion they will tear me apart . They will drag me away , with no one to rescue .
O Jehovah my God , if I have done this , if there is wrong in my hands ,
if I have repaid my ally with harm or plundered my foe without cause ,
then let the enemy pursue and overtake me , trample my life to the ground , and lay me in the dust .
O Jehovah do rise up in your anger . Lift yourself up against the fury of my enemies . Awake O my God . You have pronounced judgment .
Let the assembly of the peoples be gathered around you , and over it take your seat on high .
Jehovah judges the peoples . Judge me Jehovah according to my righteousness and according to the integrity that is in me .
Let the evil of the wicked come to an end . Establish the righteous , you who test the minds and hearts , O righteous God .
God is my shield who saves the upright in heart .
God is a righteous judge and a God who has indignation every day .
If one does not repent God will sharpen his sword . He has bent and strung his bow .
He has prepared his deadly weapons , making his arrows fiery shafts .
See how they conceive evil . They are pregnant with wickedness and give birth to lies .
They dig out a pit and fall into the hole that they have made .
Their mischief returns upon their own heads . Their violence descends on their own heads .
I will give to Jehovah the thanks due to his righteousness . I will sing praise to the name of Jehovah , the Most High .
O Jehovah , our Lord , how excellent is your majestic name in all the earth ! You have displayed your glory above the heavens .

From the mouths of little children and infants , you have built a fortress against your opponents to silence the enemy and the avenger .
When I look at your heavens , the creation of your fingers , the moon and the stars that you have set in place ,
what is man that you remember him or the son of man that you take care of him ?
You made him a little lower than god-like ones God Son of God angels . You crowned him with glory and honor .
You made him rule what your hands created . You have put everything under his control :
all the sheep and cattle , the wild animals ,
the birds , the fish , whatever swims in the currents of the seas .
O Jehovah , our Lord , how excellent is your majestic magnificent name in all the earth !
I will give thanks to Jehovah with all my heart . I will tell of all your wonders .

I will be glad , rejoice and exult in you . I will sing praise to your name , O Most High .
When my enemies turn back , they stumble and perish before you .
You have maintained my just cause . You have sat on the throne judging righteously .
You condemned nations . You destroyed wicked people . You erased their names forever and ever .
The enemy is finished-in ruins forever . You have uprooted their cities . Even the memory of them has faded .
Yet , Jehovah lives forever . He has prepared his throne for judgment .
He alone judges the world with righteousness . He judges its people fairly .
Jehovah is a refuge for the oppressed , a place of safety in times of trouble .
Those who know your name , Jehovah , will trust you . You do not abandon anyone who comes to you .
Sing praise to Jehovah ! He dwells in Zion ! Tell every nation what he has done !
God remembers those who suffer . He does not forget their cry , and he punishes those who wrong them .
Be merciful to me , O Jehovah ! See the sufferings my enemies cause me ! Rescue me from death , O Jehovah .
Let me stand before the people of Jerusalem and tell them all the things for which I praise you . I will rejoice because you saved me .
The nations have dug a pit and fallen in . They have been caught in their own trap .
Jehovah has revealed himself by his righteous judgments . The wicked are trapped by their deeds .
The grave is the destiny of all the wicked , of all those who reject God .
Needy people will not always be forgotten . Nor will the hope of meek people be lost forever .
Arise , O Jehovah . Do not let mortals gain any power . Let the nations be judged in your presence .
Strike them with terror , O Jehovah . Let the nations know that they are only mortal .
Why are you so distant , Jehovah ? Why do you hide in times of trouble ?
The wicked proudly persecutes the poor people . He will be caught in the schemes that he contrived .
The wicked person boasts about his selfish desires . He blesses the covetous , which Jehovah abhors .
In his arrogant attitude he does not search for God . His faulty reasoning concludes : » There is no God . «
He always succeeds at what he does . Your judgments are beyond his understanding . He scoffs at all his opponents .
He says to himself : » Nothing can shake me . I will never face trouble . «
His mouth is full of curses , deception , and oppression . Trouble and wrongdoing are on the tip of his tongue .
He waits in ambush in the villages . From his hiding places he kills innocent people . He searches for victims .
He lurks in his hiding place like a lion in his den . He hides there to catch oppressed people . He catches oppressed people after he draws them into his net .
His victims are crushed . They collapse , and they fall into the power of the wicked .
He says in his heart to himself : » God has forgotten . He has hidden his face . He will never see it ! «
Arise , O Jehovah ! Lift your hand , O God . Do not forget oppressed people !
Why does the wicked person despise God ? Why does he say in his heart : » God does not require it ? «
You have seen trouble and grief and placed them under your control . The victim entrusts himself to you . You alone have been the helper of orphans .
Break the arm of the wicked and evil person . Pursue his wickedness until you find no more evil .
Jehovah is king forever and ever . The nations have vanished from his land .
You have heard the desire of humble people , O Jehovah . You encourage them . You incline your ear pay close attention to them .
You provide justice for orphans and oppressed people so that no man will terrify them again .
I have taken refuge in Jehovah . How can you say to me : " Flee to your mountain like a bird ? «
Wicked people bend their bows . They set their arrows against the strings to shoot in the dark at people who are upright in heart .
What can a righteous person do when the foundations of life are destroyed ?
Jehovah is in his holy temple . Jehovah’s throne is in heaven . His eyes see . They examine the sons of men .
Jehovah tests examines righteous and wicked people alike . He hates wicked people and the ones who love violence .
He rains down fire and burning sulfur upon wicked people . He makes them drink from a cup filled with scorching wind .
Jehovah is righteous . He loves a righteous way of life . Upright people will see his face contemplate his presence .
Save me O Jehovah for no godly person is left . Faithful people have vanished from among the sons of men .

People speak lies to one another . They speak with flattering lips and with double-heart . Double Heart : They say one thing but mean another .
Jehovah will destroy every flattering lip and every bragging tongue
They say : » We will overcome with our tongues . With lips such as ours , who can be our master ? «
» Because oppressed people are robbed and needy people groan , I will now arise , « says Jehovah . » I will provide safety for those who long for it . «
The words of Jehovah are pure , like silver refined in a furnace on the earth and purified seven times .
O Jehovah , you will protect them . You will keep each one safe from those people forever .
The wicked walk about when immorality increases among the sons of men .
How long , O Jehovah ? Will you forget me forever ? How long will you hide your face from me ?

How long must I make decisions alone with sorrow in my heart day after day ? How long will my enemy triumph over me ?
Look at me ! Answer me , O Jehovah my God ! Light up my eyes , or else I will die .
My enemy will say : » I have overpowered him . « My opponents will rejoice because I have been shaken .
I trust your loving-kindness . My heart finds joy in your salvation .
I will sing to Jehovah for he has been good to me .
The fool says in his heart : » There is no God Jehovah . « They are corrupt . They do disgusting things . No one does good things .
Jehovah looks down from heaven on the sons of men to see if there is anyone who acts wisely , if there is anyone who seeks help from God .
Everyone has turned away . Together they have become rotten to the core . No one , not even one person , does good things .
Are all the workers of wickedness , those who devour my people as if they were devouring food , so ignorant that they do not call on Jehovah ?
They were in great fear and panic because God is with the righteous person .
They put the advice of oppressed people to shame because Jehovah is their protection .
If only salvation for Israel would come from Zion ! When Jehovah restores his captive people , Jacob will rejoice . Israel will be glad .
O Jehovah , who may stay in your tent ? Who may reside on your holy mountain ?
The one who walks with integrity and does what is righteous . He speaks the truth in his heart .
The one who does not malign with his tongue , do evil to a friend , or bring disgrace on his neighbor or close friend .
The one who despises those rejected by God but honors those who reverence respect Jehovah . The one who makes a promise and does not break it even though he is hurt by it .
The one who does not collect interest on a loan or take a bribe against an innocent person . Whoever does these things will never fall or be upset .
Preserve and protect me , O God , because I take refuge in you .
I said to Jehovah : » You are Jehovah my God . Without you , I have nothing good .
» The holy ones on earth are the noble ones who fill me with joy . «
Those who quickly pursue other gods multiply their sorrows . I will not pour out their sacrificial offerings of blood or use my lips to speak their names .
Jehovah is the portion of my inheritance and my cup . You determine my position in life .
Your boundary lines mark out pleasant places for me . Indeed , my inheritance is beautiful to me .
I will praise Jehovah for he advises me . My conscience inner self instructs me at night .
I always keep Jehovah in front of me . When he is at my right hand assisting me , I cannot be moved .
That is why my heart is glad and I rejoice . My body rests securely .
You do not abandon me to the grave or allow your holy one to decay .
You make the path of life known to me . Complete joy is in your presence . It is pleasant to be at your right hand forever .
Hear my plea for justice , O Jehovah . Pay attention to my cry . Open your ears to my prayer , spoken without deceit .
Let the verdict of my innocence come directly from you . Let your eyes observe what is right .
You have probed my heart . You have confronted me at night . You have tested me like silver , but you found nothing wrong . I have decided that my mouth will not sin .
I have avoided cruelty because of your word regardless of what others have done .
My steps have remained firmly in your paths . My feet have not slipped .
I have called on you because you answer me , O God . Turn your ear toward me . Listen to what I have to say .
Reveal your miraculous deeds of loving-kindness , O Savior of those who find refuge by your side from those who attack them .
Keep me as if I were the pupil apple of your eye center of attention . Hide me in the shadow of your wings .
Hide me from wicked people who violently attack me , from my deadly enemies who surround me .
They have no feeling . Their mouths have spoken arrogantly .
They have surrounded me . They have focused their attention on throwing me to the ground .
Each one of them is like a lion eager to tear its prey apart and like a young lion crouching in hiding places .
Arise , O Jehovah and confront them ! Bring them to their knees ! With your sword rescue my life from the wicked .
With your power by your hand rescue me from mortals , O Jehovah , from mortals who look forward only to this life . You fill their bellies with your treasure . Their children are satisfied with it , and they leave what remains to their children .
I will see your face be in your presence when I am declared righteous . When I wake up , I will be satisfied to see perceive comprehend you .
I love you , O Jehovah , my strength .

Jehovah is my rock and my fortress . He is my deliverer . He is my God and my crag , the one in whom I take refuge . He is my shield , and the strength of my salvation , my stronghold .
Jehovah should be praised . I called on him , and I was saved from my enemies .
The cords of death surrounded me . The torrents of wickedness frightened me .
The cords of the grave surrounded me . The snares of death confronted me .
I called on Jehovah in my distress . I cried to my God for help . He heard my voice from his temple , and my cry for help reached his ears .
Then the earth shook and quaked . Even the foundations of the mountains trembled . They shook violently because he was angry .
Smoke went up from his nostrils . A raging fire came out of his mouth . Glowing coals were kindled by it .
He spread apart the heavens and came down with a dark cloud under his feet .
He rode on a cherub and he flew . Yes he did soar on the wings of the wind .
He made the darkness his hiding place , his pavilion round about , the dark rain clouds his covering .
Out of the brightness in front of him , those rain clouds passed by with hailstones and lightning .
Jehovah thundered in the heavens . The Most High made his voice heard with hailstones and lightning .
He shot his arrows and scattered them . He flashed streaks of lightning to agitate disturb and trouble them .
The ocean floor could be seen . The foundations of the earth were laid bare at your stern warning , O Jehovah , at the blast of the breath from your nostrils .
He reached down from high above and took hold of me . He pulled me out of the raging water .
He rescued me from my strong enemy and from those who hated me , because they were too strong for me .
On the day of my calamity , they confronted me , and Jehovah came to my support .
He brought me out to a wide-open place . He rescued me because he was pleased with me .
Jehovah rewarded me because of my righteousness , because my hands are clean . He paid me back .
I have kept the ways of Jehovah and I have not wickedly turned away from my God .
All his judgments are in front of me and I have not turned away from his laws .
I was innocent as far as he was concerned . I have kept myself from guilt .
Jehovah paid me back because of my righteousness . He can see that my hands are clean .
In dealing with faithful people you are faithful . With innocent people you are innocent .
With pure people you are pure . In dealing with devious people you are clever .
You save humble people , but you humiliate the proud .
O Jehovah , you light my lamp . My God turns my darkness into light .
With you I can attack a line of soldiers . With my God I can break through barricades .
God's way is perfect ! The word of Jehovah has proven to be true . He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him .
Who is God but Jehovah ? Who is a rock except our God ?
God arms me with strength and makes my way perfect .
He makes my feet sure-footed on high places just like those of a deer .
He trains my hands for battle so that my arms can bend an archer's bow of bronze .
You have given me the shield of your salvation . Your right hand supports me . Your gentleness humility meekness makes me great .
You make a wide path for me to walk on so that my feet do not slip .
I chased my enemies and caught up with them . I did not return until I had ended their lives .
I wounded them so badly that they were unable to get up . They fell under my feet .
You armed me with strength for battle . You made my opponents bow at my feet .
You made my enemies turn their backs to me . I destroyed those who hated me .
They cried out for help , but there was no one to save them . They cried out to Jehovah , but he did not answer them .
I beat them into powder as fine as the dust blown by the wind . I threw them out as though they were dirt on the streets .
You rescued me from my conflicts with the people . You made me the leader of nations . A people I did not know will serve me :
As soon as they hear of me , they will obey me . Foreigners will cringe in front of me .
Foreigners will lose heart lose courage . They will tremble when they come out of their fortifications .
Jehovah lives ! Blessed is my rock ! Praise the God of my salvation .
God gives me vengeance ! He brings people under my authority .
He saves me from my enemies . You lift me up above my opponents . You rescue me from violent people .
That is why I will give thanks to you , O Jehovah , among the nations and make music to praise your name .
He gives great victories to his king . He shows mercy to his anointed , to David , and to his descendants forever .
The heavens declare the glory of God , and the sky displays what his hands have made .

Day to day declares speech . Night to night shows knowledge .
It is done without talking , without words , without their voices being heard .
Yet , their measuring line rule has gone out into the entire world , their message to the ends of the earth . He has set up a tent in the heavens for the sun .
It comes out of its chamber like a bridegroom . Like a champion , it is eager to run its course .
It rises from one end of the heavens . It circles around to the other . Nothing is hidden from its heat .
The law of Jehovah is perfect . It gives new life . The testimony of Jehovah is dependable . It makes the simple wise .
The statutes of Jehovah are correct . They make the heart rejoice . The commandments of Jehovah are radiant . They make the eyes shine .
The reverence of Jehovah is pure . It endures forever . The decisions of Jehovah are true . They are completely fair .
They are more desirable than gold , even the finest gold . They are sweeter than honey , even the drippings from a honeycomb .
They warn your servant . There is a great reward in following them .
Who can notice discern understand every mistake ? Forgive my hidden faults .
Keep me from sinning . Do not let anyone gain control over me . Then I will be blameless , and I will be free from any great offense .
May the words from my mouth and the thoughts from my heart be acceptable to you , O Jehovah , my rock and my Redeemer Purchaser .
Jehovah will answer you in times of trouble . The name of the God of Jacob will protect you .

He will send you help from his holy place . He will support you from Zion .
He will remember all your grain offerings and look with favor on your burnt offerings .
He will give you your heart's desire and fulfill all your plans .
We will rejoice in your salvation . We will wave our flags in the name of our God . Jehovah will fulfill all your petitions .
Now I know that Jehovah will save his anointed king . He will answer him from his holy heaven with mighty deeds of his powerful hand .
Some boast in chariots and others in horses , but we will boast in the name of Jehovah our God .
They will sink to their knees and fall , but we will rise and stand firm .
Give victory to the king , O Jehovah . Answer us in the day that we call .
The king finds joy in your strength , O Jehovah . What great joy he has in your salvation !

You gave him his heart's desire . You did not refuse the prayer from his lips .
You come to him with the blessings of good things . You set a crown of fine gold on his head .
He asked you for life . You gave him a long life , forever and ever perpetuity long lasting time .
Because of your salvation his glory is great . You place magnificence and majesty on him .
You make him blessed forever . You make him joyful with the pleasure of your presence .
Indeed , the king trusts Jehovah , and through the mercy of the Most High , he will not be moved .
Your hand spirit and power will discover all your enemies . Your powerful hand will find all who hate you .
When you appear , you will make them burn like a blazing furnace . Jehovah will swallow them up in his anger . Fire will devour them .
You will destroy their children from the earth and their offspring from among the sons of man .
Even though they scheme and devise evil against you , they will not succeed .
They turn their backs and flee because you aim your bow at their faces .
Arise O Jehovah be exalted in your strength . We will sing to praise your power .
My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? Why are you so far away from my deliverance , so far away from the words of my moaning ?

My God , I cry out by day , but you do not answer . I cry by night , but I find no rest .
Yet you are holy , you who dwell seated on the praises of Israel .
Our ancestors trusted you . They trusted , and you delivered them .
They cried to you and were delivered . They trusted you and were never disappointed .
Yet , I am a worm and not a man . I am scorned by humanity and despised by people .
All who see me laugh at me . Insults pour from their mouths . They shake their heads and say :
» Put yourself in Jehovah’s hands . Let Jehovah save him ! Let God rescue him since he is pleased with him ! «
You are the one who brought me out of the womb . You made me feel safe at my mother's breasts .
I was placed in your care from birth . From my mother's womb you have been my God .
Do not be so far away from me . Trouble is near , and there is no one to help .
Many bulls have surrounded me . Strong bulls from Bashan have encircled me .
They opened their mouths to attack me like ferocious , roaring lions .
I am poured out like water . All my bones are out of joint . My heart has melted within me like wax I am weak .
My power is dried up like pieces of broken pottery . My tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth . You lay me down in the dust of death .
Dogs have surrounded me . A mob has encircled me . They have pierced my hands and feet .
I can count all my bones . People stare and gloat over me .
They divide my clothes among themselves . They cast lots throw dice for my clothing .
Do not stay far off , O Jehovah . Come quickly to assist me , O my strength .
Rescue me from the sword , my life from vicious dogs .
Save me from the mouth of the lion and from the horns of wild oxen . You have answered me .
I will tell my people about your name . I will praise you within the congregation .
All who reverence Jehovah , praise him ! All you descendants of Jacob honor him ! Stand in awe of him , all you descendants of Israel .
Jehovah has not despised or been disgusted with the plight of the oppressed one . He has not hidden his face from that person . Jehovah heard when that oppressed person cried out to him for help .
My praise comes from you while I am among those assembled for worship . I will fulfill my vows in the presence of those who respect Jehovah .
Humble meek people will eat until they are full . Those who look to Jehovah will praise him . May your heart live forever .
All the ends of the earth will remember and return to Jehovah . All the families from all the nations will worship you .
This is because the kingdom belongs to Jehovah and he rules the nations .
All prosperous people on earth will eat and worship . All those who go down to the dust will kneel in front of him , even those who are barely alive .
There will be descendants who serve him , a generation that will be told about Jehovah .
They will tell people yet to be born about the righteousness he has performed .
Jehovah is my shepherd ; I shall not want .
He makes me to lie down in green pastures . He leads me beside the still waters .
He restores me and he leads me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake .
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I will fear no evil for you are with me . Your rod and your staff they comfort me .
You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies : you anoint my head with oil ; my cup runs over .
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of Jehovah forever .
The earth and all it contains the world and those who dwell in it belong to Jehovah .
For He has ordained it upon the seas and decreed it upon the rivers .
Who will go up to the mountain of Jehovah ? Who may stand in His holy place ?
He who has clean hands and a pure heart , who has not lifted up turned to falsehood and has not sworn deceitfully .
He will obtain blessing from Jehovah and righteousness from the God of his salvation .
This is the person who seeks him , who searches for the face of the God of Jacob .
Lift your heads , you gates . Be lifted up , you ancient doors , so that the king of glory will come in .
Who is this king of glory ? Jehovah , strong and mighty ! Jehovah , powerful in battle !
Lift your heads , you gates . Be lifted , you ancient doors , so that the king of glory may come in .
Who , then , is this king of glory ? Jehovah of Hosts is the king of glory !
I offer myself to you , O Jehovah .
I trust you , O my God . Do not let me be put to shame . Do not let my enemy’s triumph over me .
No one who waits for you will ever be put to shame , but all who are treacherous will be put to shame .
Make your ways known to me , O Jehovah , and teach me your paths .
Make me walk guide me bend me in your truth and teach me because you are my God of salvation . I wait all day long for you .
O Jehovah , remember your loving kindness and merciful deeds . They have existed from eternity .
Do not remember the sins of my youth or my rebellious ways . O Jehovah , remember me in keeping with your loving kindness and your goodness .
Jehovah is good and decent . That is why he teaches sinners the way they should live .
He leads humble people to do what is right , and he teaches them his way .
All the paths of Jehovah are loving-kindness mercy and truth for those who cling to his promise and written instructions .
O Jehovah , for the sake of your name pardon my guilt , because it is great .
Who is this person who respects Jehovah ? He is the one whom Jehovah will teach the way he should choose .
He will enjoy good things in life , and his descendants will inherit the land .
Jehovah is intimate with those who respect him . He reveals the intent of his covenant to them .
My eyes are always on Jehovah . He removes my feet from traps .
Turn to me , and have pity on me for I am lonely and afflicted .
My troubles have increased . Relieve my troubled heart , and bring me out of my distress .
Look at my misery and suffering , and forgive all my sins .
See how my enemies have increased in number , how they have hated me with vicious hatred !
Guard me and save me ! Do not let me be humiliated for I have taken refuge in you .
Integrity and honesty will protect me because I wait for you .
Rescue Israel , O God , from all its troubles !
Vindicate me , O Jehovah , because I have walked with a life-style of integrity and I have trusted you without wavering .
Examine me , O Jehovah , and test me . Look closely deeply into my heart and mind .
Your loving-kindness is in front of me . I walk in your truth .
I do not sit with deceitful men , and I will not be found among hypocrites .
I hate the assembly of evildoers and will not sit with wicked people .
I will wash my hands in innocence . I will walk around your altar , O Jehovah .
Let me publish with a voice of thanksgiving and recount all your wonders miracles .
O Jehovah , I love the place where you live , the home spiritual retreat heart and mind where your glory dwells .
Do not sweep me away with hardened sinners or my life along with bloodthirsty people .
Evil schemes are in their hands . Their right hands are full of bribes .
As for me , I walk in my integrity . Redeem ransom rescue me , and show me favor .
My feet stand on level ground . I will praise Jehovah in the congregation .
Jehovah is my light and my salvation . Whom shall I fear ? Jehovah is the stronghold of my life . Who is there to be afraid of ?
Evildoers accosted me to tear me to pieces . My opponents and enemies stumbled and fell .
Even though an army sets up camp against me , my heart will not be afraid . Even though a war breaks out against me , I will trust in Jehovah .
I have asked one thing from Jehovah . This I will seek : to live in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life , to look at Jehovah’s beauty and search for an answer in his temple .
He hides me in his shelter when there is trouble . He keeps me hidden in his tent . He puts me high on a rock .
Now my head will be lifted up above my enemies who surround me . I will offer sacrifices with shouts of joy in his tent . I will sing , yes I will sing praises to Jehovah .
Hear O Jehovah when I cry with my voice . Be gracious to me and answer me .
You said : » Seek my face look for me my presence . « My heart said to you , » O Jehovah , I will look for you . «
Do not hide your face from me . Do not angrily turn me away . You have been my help . Do not leave me ! Do not abandon me , O God of my salvation !
Even if my father and mother abandon forsake me , Jehovah will take care of me .
Teach me your way , O Jehovah . Lead me on a level path because of my enemies .
Do not surrender me to the will of my opponents . False witnesses have risen against me . They breathe out violence .
I believe that I will see the goodness of Jehovah in this world of the living .
Hope wait expect trust in Jehovah and be strong . Let your heart be courageous . Yes , hope in Jehovah .
O Jehovah , I call to you . O my rock , do not turn a deaf ear to me . If you remain silent , I will be like those who go down to the pit grave .
Hear the voice of my prayer when I call to you for help , when I lift my hands in prayer toward your most holy place .
Do not drag me away with the wicked and with troublemakers who speak of peace with their neighbors but have evil in their hearts .
Pay them back for what they have done , for their evil deeds . Pay them back for what their hands have done , and give them recompense .
Jehovah will tear them down and never build them up again . This is because they never consider what he has done or what his hands have made .
Blessed is Jehovah for he has heard my prayer supplication !
Jehovah is my strength and my shield . My heart trusted him , so I received help . My heart is triumphant and I thank him with my song .
Jehovah is the strength of his people and a fortress for the victory of his anointed .
Save your people , and bless those who belong to you . Be their shepherd , and carry them forever .
Give to Jehovah , you sons of the mighty ones . Give to Jehovah glory and power .
Give to Jehovah the glory his name deserves . Worship Jehovah in his holy splendor .
The voice of Jehovah is upon the waters . The God of glory thunders , Jehovah is over many waters .
The voice of Jehovah is powerful . The voice of Jehovah is glorious .
The voice of Jehovah breaks the cedars . Jehovah splinters the cedars of Lebanon .
He makes Lebanon skip along like a calf and Mount Sirion like a wild bull .
The voice of Jehovah cuts with flames of fire from lightning .
The voice of Jehovah shakes the wilderness . Jehovah makes the wilderness of Kadesh tremble .
The voice of Jehovah makes the deer to calve and strips the forests bare . In His temple everything says : » Glory ! «
Jehovah sat enthroned over the flood . Jehovah sits enthroned as king forever .
Jehovah will give power strength to his people . Jehovah will bless his people with peace prosperity health safety .
I will praise and exalt You , O Jehovah , for you lifted me up . You did not let my enemies rejoice over me .

O Jehovah my God , I cried to you for help , and you healed me .
O Jehovah , you brought me up from the grave . You kept me alive , that I would not go down to the pit .
Sing praise to Jehovah , you his godly ones , and give thanks to his holy name .
For His anger is only for a moment . His favor is for a lifetime ! Weeping may last for the night but a shout of joy comes in the morning .
Now as for me , I said in my prosperity : » I will never be shaken . «
By your favor , O Jehovah , you made my mountain to stand strong . You hid your face and I was alarmed dismayed .
To You , O Jehovah , I called . To Jehovah I made supplication :
What profit is there in my blood , if I go down to the pit ? Will the dust praise you ? Will it declare your truth ?
Hear , O Jehovah , and be gracious to me . O Jehovah help me .
You turned my mourning into dancing . You loosed my sackcloth and girded me with gladness .
Now I sing praise to you . I am not silent ! O Jehovah my God , I will give thanks and praise you forever .
I have taken refuge in you , O Jehovah . Never let me be put to shame . Deliver me because of your righteousness .

Turn your ear toward me . Rescue me quickly . Be a rock of refuge for me , a stronghold fortress to save me .
You are my rock and my stronghold . For the sake of your name , lead me and guide me .
You are my refuge . Pull me out of the net that they have secretly laid for me .
Into your hands I entrust my spirit . You have redeemed me , O Jehovah , God of truth .
I hate those who cling to false gods , but I do trust in Jehovah .
I will rejoice and be glad because of your loving-kindness mercy . You have seen my misery . You have known my troubles .
You have not handed me over to the hand of the enemy . You have set my feet in a large place .
Be gracious to me , O Jehovah , because I am in distress . My eyes , my life , and my body waste away with grief .
My life is spent from sorrow , my years from groaning . My strength staggers under the weight of my guilt , and my bones waste away .
I have become a disgrace because of all my opponents . I have become someone dreaded by my friends , even by my neighbors . Those who see me on the street run away from me .
I have faded from memory as if I were dead and have become like a piece of broken pottery .
I have heard the whispering of many people , terror on every side , while they made plans together against me . They were plotting to take my life .
I trust you , O Jehovah . I said : » You are my God . «
My future is in your hands . Rescue me from my enemies , from those who persecute me .
Make your face shine on me smile on me show me favor be kind and merciful to me . Save me in your loving-kindness .
O Jehovah , I have called on you , so do not let me be put to shame . Let wicked people be put to shame . Let them be silent in the grave .
Let their lying lips be speechless , since they speak against righteous people with arrogance and contempt .
Your goodness is so great ! You reserve it for those who respect you . The sons of men watch as you show it to those who take refuge in you .
You hide them in the secret place of your presence from those who scheme against them . You keep them in a secret shelter , safe from quarrelsome tongues .
Blessed is Jehovah ! He has shown me the miracle of his loving-kindness in a city under attack .
When I was panic-stricken , I said : I have been cut off from your sight . But you heard my pleas for mercy when I cried out to you for help .
Love Jehovah , all you godly ones ! Jehovah protects faithful people , but he pays back in full those who act arrogantly .
Be strong , all who wait with hope for Jehovah , and let your heart be courageous .
Blessed is the person whose transgression is forgiven and whose sin is pardoned .
Blessed is the person whom Jehovah no longer accuses of sin and who has no deceitful thoughts .
When I kept silent about my sins , my body wasted away and I groaned all day long .
Day and night your hand lay heavily on me . My strength drained in the summer heat .
I confessed my sins to you , and I did not cover up my guilt . I decided to confess them to you , O Jehovah . Then you forgave all my sins .
For this reason let all godly people pray to you when you may be found . Then raging floodwater will not reach them .
You are my hiding place . You protect me from trouble . You surround me with joyous songs of salvation .
Jehovah says : » I will instruct you . I will teach you the way that you should go . I will advise you as my eyes watch over you .
» Do not be stubborn like a horse or mule . They need a bit and bridle in their mouth to restrain them , or they will not come near you . «
Very much pain awaits wicked people , but loving-kindness and mercy surrounds those who trust Jehovah .
Be glad and find joy in Jehovah , you righteous people . Shout for joy all that are upright in heart .
Sing joyfully to Jehovah , O you righteous ones . Praise is becoming to the upright .
Give thanks to Jehovah with the harp . Sing praises to him with a harp of ten strings .
Sing to him a new song . Play your best and shout with joy .
The word of Jehovah is upright . All his works are true trustworthy .
He loves righteousness and justice . The earth is full of Jehovah’s loving-kindness .
The heavens were made by the word of Jehovah , and by the breath of his mouth their entire host .
He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap . He puts the ocean depth in his storehouses .
Let all the earth reverence Jehovah . Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him .
He spoke and it was done ! He commanded and it stood fast .
Jehovah nullifies the counsel of the nations . He frustrates the plans of the peoples .
The counsel of Jehovah and the plans of his heart stand from generation to generation , forever .
Blessed is the nation who’s God is Jehovah . Happy are the people whom he has chosen for his own inheritance .
Jehovah looks from heaven . He sees all the sons of men .
He looks from his dwelling place on all the inhabitants of the earth ,
He who fashions all their hearts observes and understands all their works .
A mighty army does not save the king . A warrior is not delivered by great strength .
A horse is a false hope for victory . It does not deliver anyone by its great strength .
Remember , the eye of Jehovah is on those who respect him , on those who hope for his loving-kindness .
It is on those who deliver them from death and keep them alive in famine .
We wait for Jehovah for he is our help and our shield .
Our heart rejoices in him , for we trust in his holy name .
Let your loving-kindness , O Jehovah , be upon us , just as we have hoped and waited patiently in you .
I will thank Jehovah at all times . My mouth will always praise him .

I will boast about Jehovah . Those who are oppressed will hear it and rejoice .
Come magnify Jehovah with me . Let us highly honor exalt promote his name together .
I went to Jehovah for help . He answered me and rescued me from all my fears .
All who look to him will be radiant . Their faces will never be covered with shame .
The poor man called out . Jehovah heard him and saved him from all his troubles .
The angel of Jehovah camps around those who reverence him , and he rescues them .
Taste and see that Jehovah is good . Blessed is the person who takes refuge in him .
Respect Jehovah , you holy people who belong to him . Those who reverence him are never in need .
Young lions go hungry and may starve , but those who seek Jehovah’s help have all the good things they need .
Come , you sons , listen to me . I will teach you the respect of Jehovah .
Which of you wants a full life ? Who would like to live long enough to enjoy good things ?
Keep your tongue from speaking evil and your lips from deceit .
Turn away from evil , and do good . Seek peace , and pursue it !
Jehovah’s eyes watch over righteous people . His ears hear their cry for help .
Jehovah confronts those who do evil in order to wipe out all memory of them from the earth .
Righteous people cry out . Jehovah hears and rescues them from all their troubles .
Jehovah is near to those whose hearts and minds are humble and contrite . He saves the broken hearted and crushed in spirit .
The righteous person has many troubles , but Jehovah rescues him from all of them .
Jehovah guards all of his bones . Not one of them is broken .
Evil will kill wicked people , and those who hate righteous people will be condemned .
Jehovah protects and redeems his servants . All who take refuge in him will never be condemned .
O Jehovah , defend me from those who attack me . Fight against those who fight against me .
Use your shields , both small and large . Arise to help me .
Hold your spear to block the way of those who pursue me . Say to me : I am your salvation .
Let those who seek my life be put to shame and disgraced . Let those who plan my downfall be turned back in confusion .
Let them be like chaff blown by the wind as the angel of Jehovah chases them .
Let their path be dark and slippery as the angel of Jehovah pursues them .
They hid their net in a pit for no reason . They dug the pit to trap me for no reason .
Surprise them with destruction . Let the net that they hid catch them . Let them fall into their own pit and be destroyed .
I will find joy in Jehovah and be joyful about his salvation .
All my bones will say : » O Jehovah , who can compare with you ? You rescue the weak person from the one who is too strong for him and weak and needy people from the one who robs them . «
Violent witnesses bring charges against me . They ask me things I know nothing about .
I am devastated because they pay me back with evil instead of good .
But when they were sick , I wore sackcloth . I humbled myself with fasting . My prayer returned unanswered .
I walked around as if I were mourning for my friend or my brother . I was bent over as if I were mourning for my mother .
Yet , when I stumbled , they rejoiced and gathered together . They gathered together against me . Unknown attackers tore me apart without stopping .
With godless and abusive mockers , they grit their teeth at me .
O Jehovah , how long will you observe ? Rescue me from their attacks . Rescue my precious life from the lions .
I will give you thanks in the large congregation . I will praise you in a mighty crowd .
Do not let my treacherous enemies gloat over me . Do not let those who hate me for no reason wink maliciously .
They do not talk about peace . Instead , they scheme against the peaceful people in the land .
They open their mouths against me and say : Aha ! Aha ! Our own eyes have seen it .
Now you see it , O Jehovah . Do not remain silent . O Jehovah , do not be so far away from me .
Wake up , and rise to my defense . Plead my case , O my God Jehovah .
Judge me by your righteousness , O Jehovah my God . Do not let them gloat .
Do not let them say : Aha , just what we wanted ! We have swallowed him up .
Let those who gloat over my downfall be thoroughly put to shame and confused . Let those who promote themselves at my expense be clothed with shame and disgrace .
Let those who are happy when I am declared innocent joyfully sing and rejoice . Let them continually say : » Jehovah is great . He is happy when his servant has peace . «
My tongue will declare your righteousness and your praise all day long .
Sin speaks to the ungodly deep within his heart . There is no reverence for God before his eyes .

He flatters himself and does not hate or even recognize his sin .
The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit and he ceased to be wise and do good .
He plans wickedness upon his bed . He walks on a path that is not good . He does not despise evil .
Your loving-kindness , O Jehovah , extends to the heavens . Your faithfulness reaches to the skies .
Your righteousness is like the mountains of God . Your judgments are like great deep water . O Jehovah , you preserve man and beast .
How precious is your loving-kindness , O God ! And the children of men put their trust in the shadow of your wings .
They drink their fill of the abundance of your house . You give them the river of your delights to drink .
For with you is the fountain source of life . In your light we see light .
O continue your kindness and unchanging love to those who know you and your righteousness to the upright in heart .
Do not let the foot of pride come upon me . Do not let the hand of the ungodly drive me away .
The doers of evil have fallen ! They have been thrust down and cannot rise .
Do not be bothered by evildoers . Do not envy those who do wicked things .
They will quickly dry up like grass and whither away like green plants .
Trust Jehovah and do good things . Live in the land , and practice being faithful .
Be happy with Jehovah and he will provide you with the desires of your heart .
Dedicate your life to Jehovah . Trust him , and he will act on your behalf .
He will cause your righteousness to shine like a light , your just cause like the noonday sun .
Surrender to Jehovah and wait patiently for him . Do not be preoccupied with an evildoer who succeeds in his way when he carries out his schemes .
Let go of anger , and leave rage behind . Do not be agitated with anger and jealousy . It only leads to evil .
For evildoers will be destroyed , but those who wait for Jehovah will inherit the land .
A short time from now the wicked man will be no more . You will look carefully for his place and he will not be there .
The meek gentle mild humble will inherit the earth and will delight in the abundance of peace .
The wicked plots against the righteous and grinds at him with his teeth .
Jehovah laughs at him , for he sees that his day will come .
The wicked have drawn the sword and bent their bow to throw down the afflicted and the needy , to slay those who are upright in conduct .
Their sword will enter their own heart . Their bows will be broken .
Better is the little of the righteous than the abundance of many wicked .
The arms of the wicked will be broken , but Jehovah sustains the righteous .
Jehovah knows the days of the blameless . Their inheritance will be forever .
They will not be ashamed in the time of evil . In the days of famine they will have abundance .
But the wicked will perish ! The enemies of Jehovah will be like the glory of the pastures . They vanish , like smoke they vanish away .
The wicked borrows and does not pay back . But the righteous is gracious and gives .
Those blessed by him will inherit the land . But those cursed by him will be destroyed .
Jehovah directs a person's steps and Jehovah delights in his way .
When he falls , he will not be thrown down headfirst because Jehovah holds on to his hand .
I have been young , and now I am old , but I have never seen a righteous person abandoned or his descendants begging for food .
He is always generous and lends freely . His descendants are a blessing .
Turn away from evil , do good , and live forever .
Jehovah loves justice , and he will not abandon his godly ones . They will be kept safe forever , but the descendants of the wicked will be destroyed .
The righteous will inherit seize take possession of the earth , and dwell on it forever in perpetuity .
The mouth of the righteous reflects on wisdom . His tongue speaks what is fair .
The law of his God is in his heart . His steps do not waver slip .
The wicked spies upon the righteous and seeks to kill him .
Jehovah will not leave him in his hand or let him be condemned when he is judged .
Wait for Jehovah and keep his way and he will exalt you to inherit the earth . You will see it when the wicked are destroyed .
I have seen a wicked , violent man spreading himself like a luxuriant tree in its native soil .
Then he passed away , and lo , he was no more . I searched for him , but he could not be found .
Mark the blameless man , and behold the upright . His future will be filled with peace .
But transgressors will be altogether destroyed . The posterity of the wicked will be destroyed .
But the salvation of the righteous is from Jehovah . He is their strength in time of trouble .
Jehovah helps them and delivers them . He delivers them from the wicked and saves them , because they take put their trust in Him .
O Jehovah , do not correct me or discipline me in your burning anger .

Your arrows have struck me . Your hand has struck me hard .
No healthy spot is left on my body because of your rage . There is no peace in my bones because of my sin .
My guilt has overwhelmed me . Like a heavy load , it is more than I can bear .
My wounds smell rotten . They fester because of my stupidity .
I am bent over and bowed down very low . All day I walk around in sadness .
My insides are filled with burning pain , and no healthy spot is left on my body .
I am numb and completely devastated . I roar because my heart is filling with anguish .
You know all my desires , O Jehovah . My groaning has not been hidden from you .
My heart pounds . I have lost my strength . In my blindness the light of my eyes has left me .
My loved ones and my friends keep their distance and my relatives stand far away because of my sickness .
Those who seek my life lay traps for me . Those who are out to harm me talk about ruining me . All day long they think of ways to deceive me .
But I am like some one deaf and speechless .
I am like one who cannot hear and who can offer no arguments .
I wait with hope for you , O Jehovah . You will answer , O Jehovah , my God .
I said : Do not let them gloat over me . When my foot slips , do not let them promote themselves at my expense .
I am ready to fall . I feel pain continually .
I confess my guilt . My sin troubles me .
My mortal enemies are growing stronger . Many hate me for no reason .
They pay me back with evil instead of good , and they accuse me because I try to do what is good .
Do not abandon me , O Jehovah . O my God , do not be so distant from me .
Come quickly to help me , Jehovah my salvation .
I said : » I will guard my ways that I may not sin with my tongue . I will guard my mouth as with a muzzle while the wicked are in my presence . «

I was silent and refrained from good . My sorrow grew worse .
My heart grew hot within me . A fire would kindle during my meditation . Then I spoke with my tongue :
» Jehovah , please make me to know my end . What is the extent of my days ? Let me know how temporary frail destitute I am .
» Indeed , you have made the length of my days very short . My life span is nothing compared to yours . Certainly , everyone alive is like a whisper in the wind .
» Every man walks about like a vain illusion . He makes a lot of noise over nothing . He hoards riches and does not know who will receive them .
» Jehovah , for what do I wait ? My hope is in you .
» Deliver me from all my sin . Do not disgrace me in front of godless fools .
» I remained speechless . I did not open my mouth because you have done this .
» Remove the plague you laid upon me . My life is over because you apposed me with your hand .
» With stern reproof you discipline people for their iniquity . Like a moth you consume what is dear to them . Certainly , everyone is like a breath of air .
» Hear my prayer , O Jehovah . Open your ear listen to my cry for help . Do not be deaf to my tears , for I am a foreign resident with you , a stranger like all my fathers .
» Look away from me so that I may smile again before I go away and am no more . «
I waited patiently for Jehovah and he bent down to me and heard my cry .

He brought me up out of the pit of destruction , out of the mud and clay . He set my feet upon a rock and made me stand erect .
He put a new song in my mouth , a song of praise to our God . Many will see , respect and trust in Jehovah .
Blessed is the man who has made Jehovah his security . He has not turned to the proud , or to those who turn aside into falsehood .
O Jehovah my God , Many are the wonders that you have done and your thoughts toward us . None can compare with you . If I would declare and teach about them , they would be too numerous to report .
You have not desired sacrifice and meal offering . You have opened my ears . Burnt offering and sin offering you have not required .
Then I said : » Here I come ! In the scroll of the book it is written about me .
» I am pleased to do your will , O my God ; Your Law is within my heart .
» I announced the good news of righteousness in the great congregation . I will not close my lips . You know that , O Jehovah .
» I have not hidden your righteousness deep in my heart . I have been outspoken about your faithfulness and your salvation . I have not hidden your mercy and your truth from the great congregation . «
Do not withhold your compassion from me , O Jehovah . May your mercy and your truth always protect me .
Countless evils have surrounded me . My sins have caught up with me so that I can no longer see . They outnumber the hairs on my head . I have lost heart lost strength , courage and motivation .
O Jehovah , please rescue me ! Come quickly to help me , O Jehovah !
Let all those who seek to end my life be confused and put to shame . Let those who want my downfall be turned back and disgraced .
Let those who say to me : Aha ! Aha ! Be stunned by their shame .
Let all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you . Let those who love your salvation continually say : Jehovah is greatly magnified !
I am oppressed and needy . May Jehovah think of me . You are my help and my salvation . O my God , do not delay !
Blessed happy is the one who has concern for helpless people . Jehovah will rescue save him in times of trouble .

Jehovah will guard him and keep him alive . He will be blessed in the land . Do not place him at the mercy of his enemies .
Jehovah will support him on his sickbed . You will restore him to health when he is ill .
I said : » O Jehovah , be gracious to me ! Heal me for I have sinned against you . «
My enemies say evil things about me : » When will he die , and when will his family name disappear ? «
When one of them comes to visit me , he speaks falsehood . His heart collects gossip . Then he leaves to tell others .
All who hate me whisper together gossip against me ; against me they devise my hurt , saying :
» A wicked thing is poured out upon him , that when he lies down , he will not rise up again . «
Even my close friend in whom I trusted , who ate my bread , has lifted up his heel against me .
Be gracious to me and raise me up , O Jehovah , that I may repay them .
By this I know that you are pleased with me , because my enemy does not shout in triumph over me .
You uphold me in my integrity . You set me in your presence forever .
Blessed be Jehovah , the God of Israel , from everlasting to everlasting . Amen and Amen .
As the deer desires the water brooks , so I desire you , O God .

I thirst for God , for the living God . When shall I come and appear before God ?
My tears have been my food day and night , while they say to me all day long : Where is your God ?
I remember these things and I pour out my heart within me . I used to go along with the crowd and lead them in procession to the house of God , with the voice of joy and thanksgiving , a multitude keeping festival .
Why am I discouraged ? Why am I so restless ? I put my hope in God for I will still praise him . He is my salvation and my God .
I am very discouraged . That is why I will remember you in the land of Jordan , on the peaks of Hermon , on Mount Mizar .
One deep sea calls to another at the roar of your waterspouts . All the whitecaps on your waves have swept over me .
Jehovah commands his mercy during the day , and at night his song is with me , a prayer to the God of my life .
I will ask God , my rock : » Why have you forgotten me ? Why must I walk around in mourning while the enemy oppresses me ? «
As a shattering of my bones , my adversaries revile me , while they say to me all day long : » Where is your God ? «
Why am I in despair ? Why have I become disturbed within me ? Wait for God for I shall yet praise him , the help of my countenance and my God .
Judge me , O God , and plead my case against an ungodly nation . Deliver me from deceitful and unjust people !
You are the God of my strength . Why have you rejected me ? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy ?
O send out your light and your truth . Let them lead me ! Let them bring me to your holy hill and to your dwelling places .
I will go to the altar of God , to God my exceeding joy . Upon the lyre I will praise you , O God , my God .
Why am I in despair ? Why am I so deeply disturbed within me ? I will put my hope in God , for I will praise him as my salvation and my God .
O God , we have heard with our ears and our fathers told us about the work that you did in their days , in the days of old .

You drove out the nations with your own hand great power . Then you planted them ; you afflicted the peoples and spread them abroad .
It was not with their swords that they took possession of the land . They did not gain victory with their own strength . It was your right hand , your arm power , and the light of your presence that did it , because you were pleased with them .
You alone are my king , O God . You won those victories for Jacob .
With you we can walk over our enemies . With your name we can trample those who attack us .
I do not rely on my bow , and my sword will never save me .
You saved us from our adversaries . You put to shame those who hate us .
All day long we praise our God . We give thanks to your name forever .
Yet you have rejected and disgraced us . You do not even go along with our armies .
You make us retreat from the enemy . Those who hate us rob us at will .
You give us over to be butchered like sheep and scatter us among the nations .
You sell your people for almost nothing , and at that price you have gained nothing .
You made us a reproach to our neighbors and an object of ridicule and contempt to those around us .
You made our defeat a proverb among the nations so that people shake their heads at us .
All day long my disgrace is in front of me . Shame covers my face .
This is because of the words of those who insult and slander us , because of the presence of the enemy and the avenger .
Although all of this happened to us , we never forgot you . We never ignored your promise .
Our hearts never turned away . Our feet never left your path .
You crushed us in a place for jackals and covered us with the shadow of death .
If we forgot the name of our God or stretched out our hands to pray to another god ,
would God not find out , since he knows the secrets in our hearts ?
We are being killed all day long because of you . We are thought of as sheep to be slaughtered .
Wake up ! Why are you sleeping , O Jehovah ? Awake ! Do not reject us forever !
Why do you hide your face ? Why do you forget our suffering and misery ?
We are bowing in the dust . Our bodies cling to the ground .
Arise ! Help us ! Rescue us because of your loving kindness !
Beautiful words fill my mind and stir my heart , as I compose this song for the king . Like the pen of a skilful writer copyist my tongue is ready with a poem .

You are the most handsome of men . You are an eloquent speaker . God has blessed you forever .
Buckle on your sword , mighty king in your splendor and majesty .
Ride on in majesty to victory for the defense truth , justice and righteousness ! Your right hand strength will teach you great things !
Your arrows are sharp . The peoples fall under you . Your arrows are in the heart of the King's enemies .
God is your throne forever and ever . A scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom .
You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness . Therefore God , Your God , has anointed you with the oil of joy above your fellows .
All Your garments are fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia . Stringed instruments from the ivory palaces have made you glad .
Kings' daughters are among your noble ladies . At Your right hand stands the queen in gold from Ophir .
Listen , O daughter , pay attention and incline your ear : Forget your people and your father's house .
Then the King will desire your beauty . Bow down to him because he is your Lord .
The daughter of Tyre will come with a gift . The rich among the people will seek your favor .
The King's daughter is all glorious within . Her clothing is interwoven with gold .
She will be led to the King in embroidered work . The virgins , her companions who follow her , will be brought to you .
They will come forward with gladness and rejoicing . They will enter into the King's palace .
In place of your fathers will be your sons . You will make them princes in all the earth .
I will cause your name to be remembered in all generations . Therefore the peoples will give you thanks forever and ever .
God is our refuge and strength , a ready help in times of trouble .

Therefore we will not fear , though the earth should change and though the mountains slip into the heart of the sea .
Though its waters roar and foam , though the mountains quake at its arrogance .
There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God , The holy dwelling places of the Most High .
God is at the center of her and she will not be moved . God will help her when morning appears .
The nations made uproar and the kingdoms tumbled . He raised his voice and the earth dissolved .
Jehovah of Hosts is with us . The God of Jacob is our stronghold .
Come and behold the works of Jehovah . He has brought destruction in the earth .
He makes wars to cease to the end of the earth ! He breaks the bow and cuts the spear in two . He burns the chariots instruments of destruction with fire .
Cease your endeavors and know that I am God . I will be exalted among the nations ! I will be glorified in the earth !
Jehovah of Hosts is with us ! The God of Jacob is our stronghold .
O clap your hands , all you people . Shout to God with the voice of joy .

For Jehovah the Most High is to be respected . He is a great King over all the earth .
He subdues peoples under us and nations under our feet .
He chooses our inheritance for us , the grandeur excellency glory of Jacob whom he loves .
God has ascended with a shout , Jehovah with the sound of a trumpet .
Sing praises to God , sing praises ; Sing praises to our King , sing praises .
For God is the King of all the earth . Sing praises with a contemplative poem .
God rules over the nations , God sits on His holy throne .
The princes of the people have assembled as the people of the God of Abraham . For the rulers shields protectors of the earth belong to God ! He has ascended to the heights .
Great is Jehovah , and greatly to be praised , in the city of our God , his sacred mountain .

His situation if beautiful . Mount Zion is the joy of the whole earth . The city of the great King is in the far reaches of the north .
God is in his citadel . He has made himself known .
Behold , the kings have assembled . And they passed by together .
They saw and then they were amazed . They were terrified and they fled in fear .
Panic seized them there , Anguish , like a woman in childbirth .
You break the ships of Tarshish using the east wind .
In the city of Jehovah of Hosts we have seen as we have heard . God will establish the city of God forever .
We have thought about considered compared your loving-kindness , O God , in the midst of your Temple .
Like according to your name , O God , your praise reaches to the ends of the earth . Your right hand is filled with righteousness .
May Mount Zion be glad and the cities of Judah rejoice because of your judgments .
Walk around Zion . Go around it . Count its towers .
Examine its embankments . Inspect its watchtowers . Then you can tell the next generation ,
This God is our God forever and ever . He will lead us until death .
Listen to this , all you people . Open your ears , all who live in the world .

Listen you common people and important ones , rich people and poor ones .
My mouth will speak wisdom . I have carefully considered understanding insights .
I will incline my ear turn my attention to a proverb . I will explain my riddle with the music of a harp .
Why should I be afraid in times of trouble , when slanderers surround me with evil ?
They trust their riches and brag about their abundant wealth .
No one can ever redeem buy back his brother or pay God a ransom for his life .
The price to be paid for him is so costly it can never be paid
so they should live forever and never see the grave pit destruction .
One can see that wise people die , that foolish and stupid people meet the same end . They leave their wealth to others .
Inwardly they think their houses are forever , their dwelling place to all generations . So they named their lands after themselves .
But mortals will not continue here with what they treasure . They are like animals that die .
This is the final outcome for fools and their followers who are delighted by what they say :
Like sheep , they are laid in the grave . Death will shepherd them . The upright will rule them in the morning . Their forms will decay in the grave , far away from their comfortable homes .
But God will redeem me buy me back from the power of the grave because he will receive me .
Do not be afraid when someone becomes rich , when the greatness of his house increases .
He will not take anything with him when he dies . Even his greatness cannot follow him .
Even though he blesses himself while he is alive . People will praise you when you do well for yourself .
He must join the generation of his ancestors who will never see light again .
Mortals , with what they treasure , still do not have understanding . They are like animals that die .
The Almighty Divine One , God of Gods , Jehovah has spoken . He has summoned the earth from where the sun rises to where it sets .
God shines from Zion . He is the perfection of beauty .
Our God will come and will not keep silent . A devouring fire is in front of him and a raging storm is around him .
He addresses summons heaven and earth to judge his people :
» Gather around me , my godly ones who have made a covenant with me through sacrifices . «
The heavens declare his righteousness because God is the judge .
» Listen , my people , and I will speak . Hear O Israel , while I testify against you : I am God , your God !
» I do not reprove you for your sacrifices or burnt offerings , which are constantly always in front of me .
» But I will not accept another young bull from your household or a single male goat from your pens .
» Every living thing in the forest , even the cattle on a thousand hills , is mine .
» I know every bird in the mountains . Everything that moves in the fields is mine .
» If I were hungry , I would not tell you , for the world and all that it contains are mine .
» Do I eat the meat of bulls or drink the blood of male goats ?
» Bring your thanks to God as a sacrifice , and pay make good your vows to the Most High .
» Call on me in times of trouble . I will rescue you , and you will honor me . «
But God says to the wicked : » How dare you quote my decrees and mouth my covenant !
» You hate discipline . You cast throw my words behind you .
» When you see a thief , you make friends with him . You keep company with people who commit adultery .
» You let your mouth speak evil . Your tongue plans deceit .
» You sit and talk against your own brother . You slander your own mother's son .
» When you did these things , I remained silent . That made you think I was like you . I will argue my point with you and lay it all out for you to see .
» Consider this , you who do not remember God . Otherwise , I will tear you to pieces , and there will be no one to deliver .
» Whoever offers thanks as a sacrifice honors me . I will let everyone who continues in my way see the salvation that comes from God . «
Have mercy on me , O God , in keeping with your loving-kindness . According to your unlimited compassion , wipe out my transgressions .


Wash me thoroughly from my perversity iniquity guilt , and cleanse me from my sin .
I admit my transgressions . My sin is always in front of me .
I have sinned against you , especially you . I have done what you consider evil in your sight . So you hand down justice when you speak , and you are blameless when you judge .
Indeed , I was born in perversity mischief evil . I was a sinner when my mother conceived me .
Yet , you desire truth from the secret person within me . Deep down inside me teach me wisdom .
Purify me from sin with hyssop , and I will be clean . Wash me , and I will be whiter than snow .
Make me hear sounds of joy and gladness . Let the bones that you have broken rejoice .
Hide your face turn away from my sins , and wipe out erase all that I have done wrong .
Create in me a clean heart , O God , and renew a steadfast dependable spirit within me .
Do not force me away from your presence , and do not take your Holy Spirit from me .
Restore the joy of your salvation to me , and establish a willing spirit in me .
I will teach your ways to transgressors , and sinners will turn to you .
Rescue deliver me from the bloodguilt of murder O God of my salvation . Let my tongue sing joyfully about your righteousness !
O Jehovah , open my lips help me speak , and my mouth will speak your praise .
You do not desire sacrifice . Otherwise , I would offer one to you . You are not pleased with burnt offerings .
The sacrifice pleasing to God is a broken spirit . O God , you do not despise a broken and sorrowful contrite heart .
Favor Zion with your goodness . Build the walls of Jerusalem .
Then you will be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness offered in the right spirit with burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings . Young bulls will be offered on your altar .
Why do you brag about the evil you have done , O mighty man ? The loving kindness of God endures continually !


Your tongue makes up wickedness . It is like a sharp razor , you master of deceit .
You prefer evil to good . You prefer lying to speaking the truth .
You love words that devour , O deceitful tongue .
God will destroy you forever . He will remove you from your dwelling place from out of the land of the living .
The righteous also sees , and fears , and laughs at him . They say :
Here is the man who did not make God his strength refuge stronghold . He trusted in the abundance of his riches . He strengthened himself in his wickedness .
But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God : I trust in the mercy and loving kindness of God forever and ever .
I will thank you forever for what you have done . I will wait in your name , for it is good , in the presence of your holy God-like ones .
The fool has said in his heart : » There is no God Jehovah . « They are corrupt and have done abominable detestable iniquity . There are none who do good . Possible deliberate scribal change from YHWH to Elohim

God looked down from heaven upon the children of men , to see if there were any who understand and seek God .
Every one of them has gone back : they are totally corrupted filthy . None do good , no , not one .
Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge ? They eat up my people as they eat bread . They have not called upon God .
There they were in great fear , where no fear was : for God has scattered the bones of him that encamps against you . You have put them to shame , because God has despised them .
Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion ! When Jehovah brings his people back from captivity , Jacob and Israel will rejoice and be glad .
Save me , O God , by your name , and judge me by your strength .


Hear my prayer , O God ; give ear to the words of my mouth .
For strangers have risen up against me . And oppressors seek after my life . They have not kept God in their presence .
Behold , God is my helper : Jehovah is with those who preserve my life .
He will repay my enemies for their evil : consume destroy them in your truth .
I will freely sacrifice to you . O Jehovah , I will praise your name for it is good .
For he has delivered me out of all trouble : and my eye has seen his defeat of my enemies .
Listen to my prayer , O God . Do not hide from my plea for favor .

Pay attention to me , and answer me . My thoughts are restless . I am confused and distracted .
This is because my enemy shouts at me and a wicked person persecutes me . They bring misery crashing down on me , and they attack me out of anger .
My heart is in turmoil within me . The terrors of death have seized me .
Fear and trembling have overcome me . Horror has overwhelmed me .
I said : If only I had wings like a dove . I would fly away and find rest .
I would run far away . I would stay in the desert .
I would hurry to a place of refuge from the raging wind and storm .
Confuse their language , O Jehovah , because I see violence and conflict in the city .
Day and night they go around on top of the city walls . Trouble and misery are everywhere .
Destruction is everywhere . Oppression and fraud never leave the streets .
If an enemy had insulted me , then I could tolerate it . If someone who hated me had attacked me , then I could hide from him .
But it is you , my equal , my close friend , and a well-known companion !
We took sweet fellowship together and walked into God's house with the crowds .
Let death suddenly take them ! Let them go into the grave while they are still alive , for evil lives in their homes and within them .
But I call on God , and Jehovah saves me .
Morning , noon , and night I complain and murmur . He listens to my voice .
In peace he will rescue me from the war waged against me . There are many against me .
God will listen and answer them . The one who has sat enthroned from the beginning will deal with them . They never change . They never respect God .
He has put forth his hands against those who were at peace with him . He has violated his covenant .
His speech was smoother than butter , but his heart was war ! His words were softer than oil , yet they were drawn swords .
Throw your burden upon Jehovah and he will sustain you . He will never allow the righteous to be shaken !
But You , O God , will bring them down to the corruption of the grave . Men of bloodshed and deceit will not live out half their days . But I will trust in you .
Be gracious to me , O God , for man has trampled upon me . Fighting all day long he oppresses me .

My foes have trampled upon me all day long . They are many who fight proudly against me .
I will put my trust in you when I am afraid .
In God , whose word I praise , In God I have put my trust . I will not be afraid . What can man do to me ?
All day long they distort my words . All their thoughts are against me for evil .
They attack , they lurk , and they watch my steps . They have waited for my life .
Because of wickedness , cast them forth , in anger put down the peoples , O God !
You have kept account of my wandering . Put my tears in your skin bottle . Are they not in your book ?
Then my enemies will turn back in the day when I call . This I know , that God is for me !
In God , whose word I praise , In Jehovah , whose word I praise ,
In God I put my trust , I will not be afraid ! What can man do to me ?
Your vows are binding upon me , O God . I will render thank offerings to you .
For you have delivered me from death , and my feet from stumbling , So that I may walk before God in the light of the living .
Be gracious to me , O God , be gracious to me for I take refuge in you . Yes , in the shadow of your wings , I will take refuge until disaster has passed .

I cry out to God Most High , To God who works for me .
He will send from heaven , and save me , He rebukes the one who is pursuing me . God will send out his loving kindness and his truth .
I am among lions . I lie among those who are set on fire , even the sons of men , whose teeth are spears and arrows . Their tongue is a sharp sword .
Be exalted , O God , above the heavens ! Let your glory be above all the earth !
They have prepared a net for my steps . I am bowed down . They dig a pit before me . But they have fallen into it .
My heart is steadfast O God . Yes my heart is steadfast . I will sing , yes , I will sing and make melody .
Wake up , my glory ! Wake up , stringed instrument and harp ! I will wake up the dawn .
I will give thanks to you among the peoples , O Jehovah . I will sing praises to you among the nations .
For your great loving kindness reaches to the heavens , and your truth to the skies .
Be exalted , O God , above the heavens . Let your glory be over all the earth .
Do you indeed speak righteousness , you silent ones O you God-like ones ? Do you judge uprightly , you sons of men ?

No , in your heart you plot unrighteousness . You measure out the violence of your hands on the earth .
The wicked go astray from the womb . They are wayward as soon as they are born . They speak lies .
Their poison is like the poison of a snake . It is like a deaf cobra that stops its ear .
It does not listen to the voice of charmers , no matter how skillful the charmer may be .
Break their teeth , God , in their mouth . Break out the great teeth of the young lions , Jehovah .
Let them vanish as water that flows away . When they draw the bow , let their arrows be made blunt .
Let them be like a snail that melts and passes away , like the stillborn child , who has not seen the sun .
Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns , he will sweep away the green and the burning alike .
The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance . He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked .
Men will say : Truly there is a reward for the righteous . Truly there is a God who judges the earth .
Rescue me from my enemies , O my God . Protect me from those who attack me .

Deliver me from troublemakers . Save me from bloodthirsty people .
They lie in ambush for me right here ! Fierce men attack me , O Jehovah , but not because of any disobedience .
And not because any sin or any guilt on my part . They hurry to take positions against me . Wake up , and help me ; see for yourself .
O Jehovah God of Hosts , God of Israel , arise to punish all the nations . Have no pity on any who pursue iniquity .
They return in the evening . They howl like dogs . They prowl the city .
See what pours out of their mouths , swords from their lips ! They think : Who will hear us ?
O Jehovah , you laugh at them . You make fun of all the nations .
O my strength , I watch for you ! God is my stronghold , my merciful God !
My God of loving-kindness will come to meet me . He will let me gloat over those who spy on me .
Do not kill them . Otherwise , my people may forget . Make them wander aimlessly by your power . Bring them down , O Jehovah , our shield .
This is because of the sins from their mouths and the words on their lips . Let them be trapped by their own arrogance because they speak curses and lies .
Destroy them in your rage . Destroy them until not one of them is left . Then they will know that God rules Jacob to the ends of the earth .
They return in the evening . They howl like dogs . They prowl the city .
They wander around to find food . If they are not full enough , they will stay all night .
But I will sing about your strength . In the morning I will joyfully sing about your loving-kindness . You have been my stronghold and a place of safety in times of trouble .
O my strength , I will make music to praise you ! God is my defense high fortress , my merciful God !
O God , you have rejected us . You have broken us down . You have been displeased and angry . Restore us , again .


You have made the land tremble . You have torn it . Mend its fractures , for it quakes .
You have shown your people hard things . You have made us drink the wine that makes us stagger .
You have given a banner to those who fear you , that it may be displayed because of the truth .
So that your loved ones may be delivered , save with your right hand , and answer us .
God has spoken from his sanctuary : I will triumph . I will divide Shechem , and measure out the valley of Succoth .
Gilead is mine , and Manasseh is mine . Ephraim also is the defense of my head . Judah is my scepter .
Moab is my washbasin . I will throw my shoe on Edom . I shout in triumph over Philistia .
Who will bring me into the strong city ? Who has led me to Edom ?
Is it not you O God , who rejected us ? You do not go out with our armies , do you God ?
Give us help against the adversary , for the help of man is vain .
Through God we shall do valiantly , for he will tread down our adversaries .
Hear my cry , O God ; listen to my prayer !

In despair and far from home I call to you ! Take me to the rock that is my safe refuge ,
for you are my protector , my strong tower defense against my enemies .
Let me live in your sanctuary all my life . Let me find safety under your wings .
You have heard my vows , O God , and you have given me what belongs to those who respect your name .
Add many years to the king's life ; let him live on and on !
May he rule forever in your presence , O God . Protect him with your constant love and faithfulness .
So I will always sing praises to your name , as I perform my vows day after day .
I wait silently for my God . My salvation comes from him .

He alone is my rock and my salvation . He is my stronghold . I cannot be severely shaken .
How long will all of you attack a man ? How long will you try to murder him , as though he were a leaning wall or a sagging fence ?
They plan to force him out of his high position . They are happy to lie . They bless with their mouths , but in their hearts they curse .
I will wait calmly for God alone , because my hope comes from him .
He alone is my rock and my salvation . He is my stronghold . I cannot be shaken .
My salvation and my glory depend on God . God is the rock of my strength , my refuge .
Trust him at all times , you people . Pour out your hearts in his presence . God is our refuge .
Common people are only a vapor in the wind . Important people are only a delusion . When all of them are weighed on a scale , they amount to nothing . They are less than a vapor in the wind .
Do not count on extortion to make you rich . Do not hope to gain anything through robbery . When riches increase , do not depend on them .
God has spoken once . I have heard it said twice : Power belongs to God .
Loving-kindness belongs to you , O Jehovah . You reward a person based on what he has done .
O God , you are my God . At dawn I search for you . I thirst for you . My body longs for you in a dry , parched land where there is no water .

I look for you in the holy place to see your power and your glory .
My lips will praise you because your love mercy loving kindness steadfast love is better than life .
So I will bless thank you as long as I live . I will lift up my hands in prayer in your name .
You satisfy me with the richest foods . My mouth will sing your praise with joyful lips .
As I lie on my bed , I remember you . Through the long hours of the night , I think about you .
You have been my help . In the shadow defense of your wings , I sing joyfully .
I cling to you . Your right hand supports holds me .
But those who try to destroy my life will go into the depths of the earth .
Swords will cut them down . Their dead bodies will be left as food for jackals .
But the king will find joy in God . Everyone who takes an oath by God will speak praise , but the mouths of liars will be shut .
Listen to my concerns , O God , and protect me from my terrible enemies .

Keep me safe from secret plots of corrupt evildoers .
Their words cut like swords , and their cruel remarks sting like sharp arrows .
They fearlessly ambush and shoot innocent people .
They are determined to do evil , and they tell themselves : Let us set traps ! No one can see us .
They devise evil plans and say : We will commit the perfect crime . The thoughts and the heart of man are deep .
But God will shoot his arrows and quickly wound them .
They will be destroyed by their own words , and everyone who sees them will tremble with fear .
They will be afraid and say : Look at what God has done and remember it .
The righteous man will be glad in Jehovah . He will take refuge in him . The upright in heart will sing praises .
Let silence and praise come before you in Zion , O God . To you the vow will be performed .

All men will come to you O Hearer of prayer .
Iniquities prevail against me . You forgive our transgressions .
How blessed is the one you choose to bring near to you , to dwell in your courts . We will be satisfied with the goodness of your house , your holy Temple .
By awesome deeds you answer us in righteousness , O God of our salvation . You are trusted to the ends of the earth and the farthest sea .
He established the mountains with his power . He is girded fortified surrounded with mighty strength .
He stills the roaring of the seas , the roaring of their waves , and the tumult of the peoples .
They who dwell in the ends of the earth stand in awe of your signs . You make the dawn and the sunset shout for joy .
You visit the earth and cause it to overflow . You greatly enrich it ! The stream of God is full of water . You prepare their grain and thus you prepare the earth .
You water its furrows abundantly ; you settle its ridges and soften it with showers . You bless its growth .
You have crowned the year with your bounty . Your paths drip with fatness .
The pastures of the wilderness drip , and the hills surround themselves with rejoicing .
The meadows are clothed with flocks and the valleys are covered with grain . They shout for joy , yes , they sing .
Shout joyfully to God , all the earth !
Praise the glory of his name with music . Make his praise glorious .
Say to God : How awe-inspiring are your deeds ! Your power is so great that your enemies will cringe in front of you .
The whole earth will worship you . They will sing praises to you . They will make music to praise your name .
Come and see the works of God , his awe-inspiring deeds for the sons of men .
He turned the sea into dry land . They crossed the river on foot . We rejoiced because of what he did there .
He rules forever with his might . His eyes watch the nations . Rebels will not be able to oppose him .
Bless our God , you peoples . Make the sound of his praise heard .
He has kept us alive and has not allowed us to fall .
You have tested us , O God . You have refined us in the same way silver is refined .
You have trapped us in a net . You have laid burdens on our backs .
You let people ride over our heads . We went through fire and water , but then you brought us out and refreshed us .
I will come into your temple with burnt offerings . I will keep my vows to you ,
the vows made by my lips and spoken by my own mouth when I was in trouble .
I will offer you a sacrifice of fattened livestock for burnt offerings with the smoke from rams . I will offer cattle and goats .
Come and listen , all who reverence God , and I will tell you what he has done for me .
With my mouth I cried out to him . High praise was on my tongue .
If I had thought about doing anything sinful , Jehovah would not have listened to me .
But God has heard me . He paid attention to my prayer .
Thanks be to God , who has not rejected my prayer or taken away his loving kindness from me .
May God be merciful to us and bless us . May he cause his face to shine on us .

That your way may be known on earth , and your salvation among all nations :
Let the peoples praise you , O God . Let all the peoples praise you !
Oh let the nations be glad and sing for joy . For you will judge the peoples with uprightness , and govern the nations on earth .
Let the peoples praise you , O God . Let all the peoples praise you !
The earth has yielded its increase . God , even our own God , will bless us .
God will bless us . All the ends of the earth will reverence and respect him .
Let God arise and let his enemies be scattered . Let those who hate him run from him .

As smoke is driven away , drive them away : as wax melts before the fire , let the wicked perish at the presence of God .
But let the righteous be glad . Let them rejoice before God : yes , let them exceedingly rejoice .
Sing to God , sing praises to his name : extol him who rides upon the heavens by his name , Jehovah , and rejoice before him .
In his holy habitation God is a father of the fatherless , and a judge of the widows .
God sets the lonely in families . He frees the prisoners who are bound with chains : but the rebellious dwell in a dry land .
O God , when you went before your people , when you march through the wilderness ,
The earth shook , the heavens also dropped at the presence of God : Sinai was moved at the presence of God , the God of Israel .
You , O God , did send a plentiful rain . You confirm your inheritance with it , when it was parched .
Your congregation lived there . You O God have prepared your goodness for the poor .
Jehovah gave the word : The women who proclaim the good news are a large army .
They say : The kings of the armies flee ; they run away . The women who remained at home will divide the goods .
Though you stayed among the sheep pens , you will be like the wings of a dove covered with silver , its feathers with yellow gold .
Meanwhile , the Almighty was still scattering kings there like snow falling on Mount Zalmon .
The mountain of Bashan is the mountain of God . The mountain of Bashan is the mountain with many peaks .
Why do you look with envy desire greed , you mountains with many peaks , at the mountain where God has chosen to live ? Certainly , Jehovah will live there forever .
The chariots of God are myriads in number , thousands upon thousands . Jehovah is among them . The God of Sinai is in his holy place .
You went to the highest place . You took prisoners captive . You have received gifts in the form of people , even from among rebellious people , so that Jehovah God may live there with them .
Thanks be to Jehovah , who daily carries our burdens for us . God is our salvation .
Our God is the God of deliverance . Jehovah of Hosts is our escape from death .
Certainly , God will crush the heads of his enemies and destroy even the hair on the heads of those who continue to be guilty .
Jehovah said : I will bring them back from Bashan . I will bring them back from the depths of the sea
so that you , my people , may bathe your feet in blood and the tongues of your dogs may lick the blood of your enemies .
O God , Your festival processions can be seen by everyone . They are the processions for my God , my king , into the holy place .
The singers are in front . The musicians are behind them . The young women beating tambourines are between them .
Praise Jehovah our God with choirs for He is the foundation of Israel .
Benjamin , the youngest , is leading them , next the leaders of Judah with their noisy crowds , then the leaders of Zebulun , and then the leaders of Naphtali .
Your God has decided you will be strong . Display your strength , O God , as you have for us before .
Kings will bring you gifts because of your temple high above Jerusalem .
Threaten the beast that is among the cattails , the herd of bulls with the calves of the nations , until it humbles itself with pieces of silver . Scatter the people who find joy in war .
Ambassadors will come from Egypt . Sudan will stretch out its hands to God in prayer .
You kingdoms of the world , sing to God . Make music to praise Jehovah .
God rides through the highest heavens , which are from ancient times , the highest heaven . Listen ! He makes his powerful voice heard .
Acknowledge the power of God . His majesty is over Israel , and his power is in the skies .
God , the God of Israel , is awe-inspiring in his holy place . He gives strength and power to his people . Praise God !
Save me , O God , for the waters have come up to my neck !

I sink in deep mire , where there is no foothold . I have come into deep waters , where the floods overflow me .
I am weary with my crying . My throat is dry . My eyes fail , looking for my God .
Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head . Those who want to destroy me , being my enemies wrongfully , are mighty . I have to restore what I did not take away .
O God , you know my foolishness . My sins are not hidden from you .
Do not let those who wait for you to be shamed through me , Lord Jehovah of Hosts . Do not let those who seek you be brought to dishonor through me , God of Israel .
Because for your sake , I have borne reproach . Shame has covered my face .
I have become a stranger to my brothers , an alien to my mother's children .
Zeal for your house consumes me . The reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me .
When I wept and I fasted , that was to my reproach .
When I made sackcloth my clothing , I became a byword to them .
Those who sit in the gate talk about me . I am the song of the drunkards .
But as for me , my prayer is to you , Jehovah , in an acceptable time . God , in the abundance of your loving kindness , answer me in the truth of your salvation .
Deliver me out of the mire , and do not let me sink . Let me be delivered from those who hate me , and out of the deep waters .
Do not let the floodwaters overwhelm me ; neither let the deep swallow me up . Do not let the pit shut its mouth on me .
Answer me , Jehovah , for your loving kindness is good . According to the multitude of your tender mercies , turn to me .
Do not hide your face turn away from your servant , for I am in distress . Answer me speedily !
Draw near to me and redeem it . Ransom me because of my enemies .
You know my reproach , my shame , and my dishonor . My adversaries are all before you .
Reproach has broken my heart , and I am full of heaviness . I looked for some to take pity , but there was none ; for comforters , but I found none .
They also gave me gall for my food . In my thirst , they gave me vinegar to drink .
Let their table before them become a snare . Let it become retribution and a trap .
Let their eyes be darkened , so that they cannot see . Let their backs be continually bent .
Pour out your indignation on them . Let the fierceness of your anger overtake them .
Let their habitation be desolate and let no one live in their tents .
For they persecute him whom you have wounded . They tell of the sorrow of those whom you have hurt .
Charge them with crime upon crime . Do not let them come into your righteousness .
Let them be blotted out of the book of life , and not be written with the righteous .
I am in pain and distress . O God , Let your salvation protect me .
I will praise the name of God with a song . I will magnify him with thanksgiving .
It will please Jehovah better than an ox of bull that has horns and hoofs .
The humble have seen it and are glad . And you , who seek after God , let your heart live .
For Jehovah hears the needy and does not despise his captive people .
Let heaven and earth praise him , the seas and everything that moves in it !
God will save Zion , and build the cities of Judah . They shall settle there , and own it .
The children also of his servants shall inherit it . Those who love his name shall dwell in it .
Come quickly to rescue me , O God ! Come quickly to help me , O Jehovah !

Let those who seek my life be confused and put to shame . Let those who want my downfall be turned back and disgraced .
Let those who say : » Aha ! Aha ! « Be turned back because of their own shame .
Let all who seek you rejoice and be glad because of you . Let those who love your salvation continually say : » Let God be magnified ! «
But I am oppressed and needy . O God , come to me quickly . You are my help and my deliverer . O Jehovah do not delay !
O Jehovah , I have come to you for protection ; never let me be defeated !
You are righteous , help me and rescue me . Listen to me and save me !
You are my secure shelter and a strong fortress to protect me . You are my refuge and defense .
My God , rescue me from wicked people , from the power of cruel and evil people .
Lord Jehovah , I put my hope in you . I have trusted in you since I was young .
I have relied on you all my life . You have protected me since the day I was born . I will always praise you .
My life has been an example to many , because you have been my strong defender .
All day long I praise you and proclaim your glory .
Do not reject me when I am old or abandon me when I lose my strength .
My enemies talk about me . They watch me as they plot to take my life .
They say : » God has abandoned him . Pursue him and grab him because there is no one to rescue him . «
O God , do not be so distant from me . O my God , come quickly to help me .
Let those who accuse me come to a shameful end . Let those who want my downfall be covered with disgrace and humiliation .
But I will always have hope . I will praise you more and more .
All day long my mouth will tell of your righteousness and of your salvation . I do not know the number .
I will come with the mighty deeds of Jehovah God . I will make mention of your righteousness , yours alone .
O God , You taught me from my youth , and I still declare your wondrous deeds .
And even when I am old and gray , O God , do not forsake me , until I declare your strength to this generation , your power to all who are to come .
Your righteousness also , God , reaches to the heavens . You have done great things . God , who is like you ?
You who have shown us many and bitter troubles , you will let me live . You will bring us up again from the depths of the earth .
Increase my honor and comfort me again .
I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness , my God . I sing praises to you with the stringed instrument , Holy One of Israel .
My lips will shout for joy ! You have redeemed me and I sing praises to you !
My tongue will also talk about your righteousness all day long . They who want to harm me are disappointed and confounded .
O God , give the king your justice . Give your righteousness to the royal son .
He will judge your people with righteousness , and your poor with justice .
The mountains shall bring prosperity to the people . The hills bring the fruit of righteousness .
He will judge the poor of the people . He will save the children of the needy , and will break the oppressor in pieces .
They will fear you as long as the sun and moon endures , throughout all generations .
He will come down like rain on the mown grass , like showers that water the earth .
In his day the righteous will flourish . There will be abundance of peace , until the moon is no more .
He will have dominion from sea to sea , from the Euphrates River to the ends of the earth .
Those who dwell in the wilderness will bow before him . His enemies shall lick the dust .
The kings of Tarshish and of the isles will bring tribute presents . The kings of Sheba and Seba will offer gifts .
Yes , all kings will bow down before him . All nations will serve him .
When he cries he will deliver the needy and the poor who have no helper .
He will have pity on the poor and needy . He will save the needy .
He will redeem rescue them from oppression and violence . Their blood will be precious in his sight .
He will live , and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba . Men shall pray for him continually . They shall praise him all day long .
There shall be abundance of grain throughout the land . Its fruit sways like Lebanon . Let it flourish , thriving like the grass of the field .
His name will endure forever . His name will continue as long as the sun shines . May all nations be blessed through him and call him blessed .
Blessed be Jehovah God , the God of Israel , who alone does miracles .
Blessed be to his glorious name forever . May the whole earth be filled with his glory . Amen and amen !
The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended .
God is truly good to Israel , to those who are pure in heart .
But my feet had almost stumbled . They had almost slipped .
I was envious of arrogant people when I saw the peace and prosperity that wicked people enjoy .
They suffer no pain . Their bodies are healthy .
They have no drudgery in their lives like ordinary people . They are not plagued with problems like mankind .
That is why arrogance is their necklace and violence covers them like clothing .
Their eyes stand out with fatness , and their heart’s imagination run wild .
They ridicule . They speak maliciously . They speak arrogantly about oppression .
They set their mouth in the heavens and their tongue parades through the earth .
Therefore his people return here and here they drink waters of abundance .
They ask : How does God know ? And is there knowledge with the most High ?
Behold , these are the ungodly . They prosper in the world ; they increase in wealth .
I have cleansed my heart in vain , and washed my hands in innocence .
I have been plagued all day long , and chastened every morning .
If I say , I will speak thus ; then , I would offend the generation of your children .
When I thought to know this , it was too painful for me .
I understood their end when I went into the sanctuary of God .
Surely you set them in slippery places . You threw them down into destruction .
How are they destroyed , suddenly ! They are utterly consumed with terrors .
It is like waking up from a dream , O Jehovah . When you awake you will despise everything they represent .
My heart was grieved and I was pierced within .
I was so foolish and ignorant : I was like a beast before you .
Nevertheless I am continually with you . You hold me by my right hand .
You will guide me with your counsel , and afterward you give me honor glory .
Who have I in heaven but you ? I desire none on earth except you .
My flesh and my heart fail : God is the strength of my heart , and my portion forever .
Those who are far from you will perish . You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you .
It is good for me to draw near to God . I have put my trust in Jehovah God , that I may declare all your works .
God , why have you rejected us forever ? Why do you smoke with anger against the sheep of your pasture ?
Remember your congregation , which you purchased long ago . For you have redeemed it to be the tribe of your inheritance , Mount Zion , in which you have lived .
Lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins , all the evil that the enemy has done in the sanctuary .
Your adversaries have roared in the middle of your assembly . They have set up their standards as signs .
They behaved like men wielding axes cutting through a thicket of trees .
They strike down all its carved work with hatchet and hammers .
They have burned your sanctuary to the ground . They have profaned the dwelling-place of your name .
They said in their hearts : » We will destroy them completely . They burned up all the synagogues of God in the land . «
We see no miraculous signs . There is no longer any prophet . There is no one who knows how long .
How long , God , will the adversary reproach ? Will the enemy blaspheme your name forever ?
Why do you draw back your hand , even your right hand ? Take it out of your pocket and consume them !
Yet God is my King of old , working salvation in the middle of the earth .
You divided the sea by your strength . You broke the heads of the sea monsters Egypt’s Army in the waters .
You broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces . You gave him as food to people and desert creatures .
You opened up spring and stream . You dried up mighty rivers .
The day and the night are yours . You have prepared the light and the sun .
You have set all the boundaries of the earth . You have made summer and winter .
Remember this , that the enemy has mocked you , Jehovah . Foolish people have blasphemed your name .
Do not deliver your turtledove endeared to wild beasts . Do not forget the life of your poor forever .
Honor your covenant , for haunts of violence fill the dark places of the earth .
Do not let the oppressed return ashamed . Let the poor and needy praise your name .
Arise , O God ! Plead your own cause . Remember how the foolish man treats you with contempt all day .
Do not forget the voice of your adversaries . The tumult of those who rise up against you ascends continually .
We give thanks to you , O God , we give thanks , for your name is near and men declare your wondrous works .

When I select an appointed time , it is I who judge in righteousness .
The earth and all who dwell in it dissolve melt become faint hearted . I have firmly set its pillars .
I said to the boastful : » Do not boast ! « I said to the wicked : » Do not lift up the horn brag about your power ! «
Do not lift up your horn on high . Do not speak with insolent pride .
There is no exaltation from the east , or from the west , or from the desert .
God is the Judge ; He brings down one and exalts another .
Jehovah holds a cup in his hand . The wine foams and is well mixed . So he pours from it . Surely all the wicked of the earth must drain and drink down its dregs .
But as for me , I will declare forever and I will sing praises to the God of Jacob .
He will remove the horn power of the wicked . The horn power of the righteous will be exalted .
God is known in Judah . His name is great in Israel .

His tabernacle is in Salem Jerusalem . His dwelling place also is in Zion .
There He broke the flaming arrows , the shield and the sword and the weapons of war .
You are glorious , more majestic than the mountains of prey .
The strong and valiant were plundered , they sank into sleep . None of the warriors could use his hands .
At Your rebuke , O God of Jacob , both rider and horse were cast into a dead sleep .
You , even you , are to be respected . Who may stand in your presence when once you are angry ?
You caused judgment to be heard from heaven . The earth feared and was still
when God arose to judgment , to save all the humble of the earth .
For the wrath of man shall praise you . You will fortify yourself with a remnant of wrath .
Make vows to Jehovah your God and fulfill them . Let all who are around him bring gifts to him . He should be respected .
He will cut off the spirit of princes . He is awesome to the kings of the earth .
My cry goes to God ! Indeed , I cry to God for help , and he listened to me .

In the day of my trouble I sought Jehovah . My hand was stretched out in the night , and did not get tired . I refused to be comforted .
I remember God , and I groan . I complain , and my spirit is overwhelmed .
You hold my eyelids open . I am so troubled that I cannot speak .
I have considered the days of old , the years of ancient times .
I remember my song in the night . I consider in my own heart ; my spirit diligently inquires :
Will Jehovah reject us forever ? Will he be favorable no more ?
Has his loving kindness vanished forever ? Does his promise fail for generations ?
Has God forgotten to be gracious ? Has he , in anger , withheld his compassion ?
Then I thought : I will remember the years of the right hand of the Most High .
I will remember Jehovah's deeds ! I will remember your wonders of old .
I will also meditate on all your work and consider your activities .
Your way , O God , is in the sanctuary . What god is as great as our God ?
You are the God who does wonders . You have made your strength known among the peoples .
You have redeemed your people with your arm , the sons of Jacob and Joseph .
The waters saw you , God . The waters saw you , and they were agitated . The depths also convulsed .
The clouds poured out water . The skies resounded with thunder . Your arrows also flashed around .
The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind . The lightning lit up the world . The earth trembled and shook .
Your way was through the sea ; your paths through the great waters . Your footsteps were not known .
You led your people like a flock , by the hand of Moses and Aaron .
Listen , O my people , to my law . Incline your ears to the words of my mouth .
I will open my mouth in an illustration . I will utter dark sayings of old ,
That we have heard and known and our fathers have told us .
We will not conceal them from their children , but tell to the generation to come the praises of Jehovah , and his strength and his wondrous works that he has done .
He established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel . This he commanded our fathers that they should teach them to their children ,
That the generation to come might know , the children to be born , that they may arise and tell to their children ,
That they should put their confidence in God and not forget the works of God but keep his commandments .
They should not be like their fathers , a stubborn and rebellious generation , a generation that did not prepare its heart and whose spirit was not faithful to God .
The sons of Ephraim were archers well equipped with bows . Yet they turned and ran in the day of battle .
They did not keep the covenant of God . They refused to walk in his law .
They forgot his deeds and his miracles that he had shown them .
He wrought wonders before their fathers in the land of Egypt , in the field of Zoan .
He divided the sea and caused them to pass through . He made the waters stand up like a heap .
He led them with the cloud by day and with a light of fire by night .
He split the rocks in the wilderness and gave them abundant drink like the ocean depths .
He brought forth streams also from the rock and caused waters to run down like rivers .
Yet they still continued to sin against him . They rebelled against the Most High in the desert .
In their heart they put God to the test by asking food according to their desire .
Then they spoke against God . They said : Can God prepare a table in the wilderness ?
Behold , He struck the rock so that waters gushed out , and streams were overflowing ; Can He give bread also ? Will He provide meat for His people ?
Therefore Jehovah heard and was full of wrath . A fire was kindled against Jacob and anger also mounted against Israel ,
Because they did not believe in God and did not trust in his salvation .
Yet he commanded the clouds above and opened the doors of heaven .
He rained down manna upon them to eat and gave them food from heaven .
Man did eat the bread of angels . He sent them food in abundance .
He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens and by his power he directed the south wind .
He rained meat upon them like the dust , even winged fowl like the sand of the seas ,
Then he let them fall in the midst of their camp , round about their dwellings .
So they ate and were well filled , and their desire he gave to them .
Before they had satisfied their desire , while their food was in their mouths ,
The anger of God rose against them and killed some of their stoutest ones , and subdued the choice men of Israel .
In spite of all this they still sinned . They did not believe in his wonderful works .
He brought their days to an end like a whisper in the wind . He brought their years to an end in terror .
When he killed some of them , the rest searched for him . They turned from their sins and eagerly looked for God .
They remembered that God was their rock , that the Most High was their defender .
They flattered him with their mouths and lied to him with their tongues .
Their hearts were not loyal to him . They were not faithful to his promise .
But he is compassionate . He forgave their sin . He did not destroy them . He restrained his anger many times . He did not display all of his fury .
He remembered that they were only flesh and blood , a breeze that blows and does not return .
How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness ! How often they caused him grief in the desert !
They tested God again and again , and they pushed the Holy One of Israel to the limit .
They did not remember his power and the day he freed them from their oppressor ,
when he performed his miraculous signs in Egypt , his wonders in the fields of Zoan .
He turned their rivers into blood so that they could not drink from their streams .
He sent a swarm of flies that bit them and frogs that ruined them .
He gave their crops to grasshoppers and their produce to locusts .
He killed their vines with hail and their fig trees with frost .
He let the hail strike their cattle and bolts of lightning strike their livestock .
He sent his fierce burning anger , his rage and fury against them . He sent an army of destroying angels .
He cleared a path for his anger . He did not spare them from death . He let the plague take their lives .
He destroyed every firstborn in Egypt , the ones born in the tents of Ham when their fathers were young .
He led his own people out like sheep and guided them like a flock through the wilderness .
He led them safely . They had no fear while the sea covered their enemies .
He brought them into his holy land , to this mountain that his power had won .
He drove nations out of their way and gave them the land of the nations as their inheritance . He settled the tribes of Israel in their own tents .
They tested God Most High and rebelled against him . They did not obey his written instructions .
They were disloyal and treacherous like their ancestors . They were like arrows shot from a defective bow .
They provoked him to anger indignation because of their illegal worship sites . They made him furious because they worshiped idols .
When God heard , he became furious . He greatly abhorred Israel .
He abandoned his dwelling place in Shiloh , the tent where he had lived among humans .
He allowed his power to be taken captive and handed his glory over to an oppressor .
He let swords kill his people . He was furious with those who belonged to him .
Fire consumed his best young men , so his virgins were not given in marriage .
His priests were cut down with swords . The widows of his priests could not even weep for them .
Jehovah woke up like one who had been sleeping , like a warrior sobering up from too much wine .
He struck his enemies from behind and disgraced them forever .
He rejected the tent of Joseph . He did not choose the tribe of Ephraim ,
but he chose the tribe of Judah , Mount Zion he loved .
He built his holy place to be like the high heavens , like the earth that he made to last for a long time .
He chose his servant David . He took him from the sheep pens .
He brought him from tending the ewes that had lambs so that David could be the shepherd of the people of Jacob , of Israel , the people who belonged to Jehovah .
With unselfish devotion David became their shepherd . With skill he guided them .
O God , the nations have invaded the land that belongs to you . They have dishonored defiled your holy temple . They have left Jerusalem in ruins .
They have given the dead bodies of your servants to the birds for food . They have given the flesh of your godly ones to the animals .
They have shed the blood of your people around Jerusalem as though it were water . There is no one to bury your people .
We have become a disgrace to our neighbors , an object of ridicule and contempt to those around us .
How long , O Jehovah ? Will you remain angry forever ? Will your fury zeal continue to burn like fire ?
Pour your fury anger on the nations that do not know you , on the kingdoms that have not called you .
They have devoured Jacob . They have destroyed his home .
Do not hold the crimes of our ancestors against us . Reach out to us soon with your compassion , because we are helpless .
Help us , O God of our salvation , for the glory of your name . Rescue us , and provide atonement for our sins for the honor of your name .
Why should the nations be allowed to say : Where is their God ? Let us watch as the nations learn that there is punishment for shedding the blood of your servants .
Let the groans of prisoners come into your presence . With your powerful arm according to the greatness of your power rescue those who are condemned to death .
Pay each one of our neighbors back with seven times the number of insults they used to insult you , O Jehovah .
Your people , the flock in your pasture , will thank you forever . We will praise you throughout all generations .
Oh , give ear listen , Shepherd of Israel , you who lead Joseph like a flock ; you who are enthroned above the cherubim , shine forth !

Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh , stir up your power and come to save us !
O God , restore us and cause your face to shine smile on us show us favor that we will be saved .
O Jehovah God , commander of armies , how long will you be angry against the prayer of your people ?
You made them eat tears as food . You often made them drink their own tears .
You made us a source of conflict to our neighbors . Our enemies make fun of us .
O God , commander of armies , restore us and smile on us so that we may be saved .
You brought a vine from Egypt . You forced out the nations and planted it .
You cleared the ground for it so that it took root and filled the land .
Its shade covered the mountains . Its branches covered the mighty cedars .
It reached out with its branches to the Mediterranean Sea . Its shoots reached the Euphrates River .
Why did you break down the stone fences around this vine ? All who pass by are picking its fruit .
Wild boars from the forest graze on it . Wild animals devour it .
O God , commander of armies , come back ! Look from heaven and see ! Come to help this vine .
Take care of what your right hand planted , the son you strengthened for yourself .
The vine has been cut down and burned . Let them be destroyed by the threatening look on your face .
Let your power rest on the man you have chosen , the son of man you strengthened for yourself .
Then we will never turn away from you . Give us life again , and we will call on your name .
O Jehovah God , commander of armies , restore us , and cause your face to shine smile on us so that we may be saved .
Sing for joy to God our strength . Shout joyfully to the God of Jacob .

Sing a song and strike the tambourine . Play the sweet sounding lyre with the harp .
Blow the trumpet at the new moon , at the full moon , and on our feast day .
For this is required by the law of Israel . It is an ordinance of the God of Jacob .
He established it for a testimony in Joseph Israel when he went throughout the land of Egypt . I heard a language that I did not understand . He said :
» I relieved his shoulder of the burden . His hands were freed from the basket .
» You called in trouble and I rescued you . I answered you in the secret place of thunder . I tested you at the waters of Meribah . .
» Hear , O my people , and I will admonish you . O Israel , if you would listen to me !
» You must have no strange god among you . Do not worship any foreign god .
» I , Jehovah , am your God ! I brought you up from the land of Egypt . Open your mouth wide and I will fill it .
» My people did not listen to my voice . Israel did not obey me .
» Therefore I gave them over to their stubborn hearts . They walked in their own counsel .
» Oh that my people would listen to me , that Israel would walk in my ways !
» I would quickly subdue their enemies and turn my hand against their adversaries .
» Those who hate Jehovah would pretend obedience submission to him . Their time of punishment would be long lasting .
» I would feed you with the finest of the wheat , and with honey from the rock I would satisfy you . «
God stands in the congregation of the mighty . He pronounces judgment among the god-like ones :
» How long are you going to judge unjustly ? How long are you going to show partiality to the wicked ?
» Defend the weak and fatherless . Protect the rights of the oppressed and the poor .
» Rescue the weak and needy . Help them escape the power of the wicked . «
Wicked people do not know or understand anything . As they walk around in the dark , all the foundations of the earth shake .
I said : » You are god-like ones . You are all sons of the Most High .
» But you will certainly die like humans and fall like any prince . «
Arise , O God ! Judge the earth , because all the nations belong to you .
O God , do not keep silent . Do not keep silent and do not be still , O God .

For , behold , your enemies are stirred up . Those who hate you have lifted up their heads .
They conspire with cunning against your people . They plot against your cherished ones .
They say : » Come and let us destroy them as a nation , that the name of Israel may be remembered no more . «
For they have come to an agreement united in thought . They form an alliance against you .
The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites ; Moab , and the Hagrites ;
Gebal , Ammon , and Amalek ; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre ;
Assyria also is joined with them . They have helped the children of Lot .
Do to them as you did to Midian , as you did to Sisera , as to Jabin , at the river Kishon
Who perished at Endor and became as dung for the earth .
Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb ; yes , all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna .
For they said : » Let us take possession Of God's pasturelands . «
My God , make them like tumbleweed , like chaff before the wind .
Like the fire that consumes the forest , the flame that sets the mountains on fire ,
pursue them with your tempest and terrify them with your storm .
Fill their faces with confusion that they may seek your name , Jehovah .
Let them be disappointed and dismayed forever . Yes , let them be confounded and perish ,
That they may know that you alone , whose name is Jehovah , are the Most High over all the earth .
How lovely are your dwelling places , O Jehovah of Hosts !

How I want to be there ! I long to be in Jehovah’s temple . With my whole being I sing for joy to the living God .
Even small birds have built a nest , and the swallows have their own home . They keep their young near your altars O Jehovah my king and my God .
How happy blessed are those who live in your temple always singing praise to you .
How happy are those whose strength comes from you , who are eager to make the pilgrimage to Mount Zion .
As they pass through the dry valley of Baca , it becomes a place of springs ; the autumn rain fills it with pools .
They grow stronger as they go and they will see the God of gods on Zion .
Hear my prayer , Lord Jehovah of Hosts . Listen , O God of Jacob !
Look at our shield , O God . Look with favor on the face of your anointed one .
One day in your courtyards is better than a thousand anywhere else . I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God , than to dwell in the tents of wickedness .
For Jehovah God is a sun and shield . Jehovah will give favor and honor . He will not withhold blessing from those who walk faithfully in truth .
O Jehovah of Hosts , blessed is the man who trusts in you .
You favored your land , O Jehovah . You restored the prosperity of Jacob .

You removed your people's guilt . You pardoned all their sins .
You laid aside all your fury . You turned away from your burning anger .
Restore us , O God of our salvation . Put an end to your anger against us .
Will you be angry with us forever ? Will you ever let go of your anger in the generations to come ?
Will you not restore our lives again so that your people may find joy in you ?
Show us your loving-kindness , O Jehovah . Grant us your salvation .
I want to hear what the Lord Jehovah says , because he promises peace to his people , to his godly ones . But they must not go back to their stupidity .
Indeed , his salvation is near those who reverence him , and his glory will remain in our land .
Mercy and truth have met . Righteousness and peace have kissed .
Truth springs from the ground , and righteousness will look down from heaven .
Jehovah will certainly give us what is good , and our land will produce crops .
Righteousness will go ahead of him and make a path for his steps .
Listen to me , O Jehovah . Answer me , for I am oppressed and needy .
Protect me , for I am a godly man . You are my God . Save your servant who trusts you .
Have pity on me , O Jehovah , since I call out to you all day long .
Give me joy , O Jehovah , and lift me up .
You , O Jehovah , are good and forgiving , full of loving kindness toward everyone who calls out to you .
Open your ears to my prayer , O Jehovah . Pay attention to my supplications !
When I am in trouble , I call out to you because you answer me .
No god is like you , O Jehovah . No one can do what you do .
All the nations that you have made will bow in your presence , Jehovah . They will honor glorify you .
Indeed , you are great , a worker of miracles . You alone are God .
Teach me your way , O Jehovah , so that I may live in your truth . Unite my heart to reverence you .
I will give thanks to you with all my heart , Jehovah my God . I will honor glorify you forever .
Your loving kindness toward me is great . You have rescued me from the depths of the grave .
O God , arrogant people attack me , and a mob of ruthless people seeks my life . They think nothing of you .
But you , O Jehovah , are a compassionate and merciful God . You are patient , always faithful and ready to forgive .
Turn toward me , have pity and be gracious to me . Give me your strength because I am your servant . Save me because I am the son of your female servant .
Grant me some proof of your goodness so that those who hate me may see it and be put to shame . You , O Jehovah , have helped me and comforted me .
His foundation is in the holy mountains .
Jehovah loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwelling places of Jacob .
Glorious things are spoken of you , O city of God .
I will mention Rahab defamatory word for Egypt a boaster and Babylon among those who know me . Behold , Philistia and Tyre with Ethiopia : » This one was born there . «
But of Zion it shall be said : » This one and that one were born in her and the Most High will establish her . «
Jehovah will count when he registers the peoples : » This one was born there . «
Then those who sing as well as those who play the flutes will say : » All my springs of joy are in you . «
O Jehovah , God of my salvation I cry out to you day and night .

Let my prayer come before your presence . Turn your ear to hear my cries .
I am filled with troubles , and my life comes closer to the grave .
I am numbered with those who go into the pit . I am like a man without any strength .
I am abandoned with the dead , like those who have been killed and lie in graves . I am like those whom you no longer remember , who are cut off from your hand power care .
You have put me in the bottom of the pit , in deep dark places .
Your rage lies heavily on me . You afflict me with all your waves .
You have taken my friends far away from me . You made me disgusting to them . I am shut in , and I cannot get out .
My eyes grow weak because of my suffering . All day long I call out to you , O Jehovah . I stretch out my hands to you in prayer .
Will you perform miracles for those who are dead ? Will the dead rise and give thanks to you ?
Will anyone tell about your loving kindness in the grave or about your faithfulness after they parish ?
Will anyone know about your miracles in that dark place or about your righteousness mercy in the place of destruction ?
I cry out to you for help , O Jehovah , and in the morning my prayer will come before you .
Why do you reject me , O Jehovah ? Why do you hide your face from me turn from me ?
Ever since I was young , I have been suffering and near death . I have endured your terrors , and now I am in despair .
Your burning anger has swept over me . Your terrors have destroyed me .
They swirl around me all day long like water . They surround me on all sides .
You have taken my loved ones and friends far away from me . Darkness is my only friend !
I will sing of the loving kindness of Jehovah forever . With my mouth I will make known your faithfulness to all generations .

For I have said : » Loving-kindness will be built up forever . You will establish your faithfulness in the heavens . «
» I made a covenant with my chosen ; I swore to David my servant :
‘ I will establish your seed forever and build up your throne to all generations . ’
The heavens will praise your wonders , O Jehovah , Your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones .
For who in the heavens is comparable to Jehovah ? Who among the sons of the mighty is like Jehovah ?
He is a God greatly reverenced in the council of the holy ones . He is awesome above all those who are around Him ?
O Jehovah God of hosts , who is like You , O mighty Jehovah ? Your faithfulness also surrounds you .
You rule the raging of the sea ; when its waves rise , you still them .
You crushed Rahab like one who is slain . You scattered your enemies with your mighty arm power .
The heavens and the earth are yours . You have founded the world and all it contains .
The north and the south , you have created them ; Tabor and Hermon shout for joy at your name .
You have a strong arm ! Your hand is mighty power by Holy Spirit ; your right hand is exalted .
Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne . Loving kindness and truth go before you .
How blessed are the people who know the joyful sound ! O Jehovah , they walk in the light of your countenance .
They rejoice in your name all the day . They are exalted in your righteousness .
For you are the glory of their strength and by your favor our horn strength is exalted increased .
For our shield belongs to Jehovah , and our king to the Holy One of Israel .
Once you spoke in vision to your godly ones . You said : » I have given help to one who is mighty . I have exalted one chosen from the people . «
I have found David my servant . I anointed him with my holy oil .
With him my hand will be established ; my arm also will strengthen him .
No enemy will tax him . No wicked man will oppress him .
I will beat down his adversaries before him . I will strike those who hate him .
But my faithfulness and my loving kindness will be with him . In my name , his horn power strength will be exalted increased .
I will set his hand also on the sea , and his right hand on the rivers .
He will call to me : » You are my Father , My God , and the rock of my salvation ! «
I will also appoint him my firstborn , the highest of the kings of the earth .
I will keep my loving kindness for him forevermore . My covenant will stand firm with him .
I will make his descendants endure forever and his throne like the days of heaven .
If his descendants abandon my law and do not live by my rules ,
if they violate my statutes and do not obey my commandments ,
then with a rod I will punish their transgression and their crimes with beatings .
But I will not take my loving kindness away from him or allow my truth to become perverted .
I will not dishonor my promise or alter my own agreement .
On my holiness I have taken an oath : I will not lie to David .
His descendants will last forever . His throne will be in my presence like the sun .
It shall be established forever like the moon . It will be like a faithful witness in heaven .
But you have despised , rejected , and become angry with your anointed one .
You have refused to recognize the covenant to your servant and have thrown his crown into the dirt .
You have broken through all his walls and have laid his fortified cities in ruins .
Everyone who passed by robbed him . He has become the object of his neighbors' scorn .
You lifted up the right hand of his enemies and made all of his adversaries rejoice .
You even took his sword out of his hand and failed to support him in battle .
You put an end to his splendor and hurled his throne to the ground .
You cut short the days of his youth and covered him with shame .
How long , O Jehovah ? Will you hide yourself forever ? How long will your anger continue to burn like fire ?
Remember how short my life span is ! Have you created the sons of men for no reason ?
Can man go on living and never see death ? Who can set himself free from the power of the grave ?
Where is the evidence of your mercy , Lord ? You swore an oath to David on the basis of your faithfulness .
Jehovah , remember the reproach of your servant . Remember how I have carried in my heart the insults from so many people .
Your enemies insulted me . They insulted your anointed every step he took .
Blessed be Jehovah forevermore ! Amen and Amen .
O Jehovah , you have been our refuge throughout every generation .
Before the mountains were born , before you gave birth to the earth and its inhabitants , you are God from everlasting to everlasting .
You turn men back into dust and say : » Return , O sons of men ! «
In your sight a thousand years are like a single day , like yesterday , already past like an hour in the night .
You sweep mortals away in the sleep of death . They sprout again in the morning like grass .
In the morning they blossom and sprout . In the evening they fade and wither away .
Your anger consumes us . We are troubled by your rage .
You set our sins in front of you . You put our secret sins in the light of your presence .
Indeed , all our days slip away because of your fury . We live out our years like one long sigh .
The days of our lives are seventy or eighty years if we are in good health . But the best of them bring trouble and misery . Indeed , they are soon gone , and we fly away .
Who understands the power of your anger , and your fury according to the reverence that is due you ?
Teach us to number each of our days so that we may present to you a heart of wisdom .
Return , O Jehovah ! How long ? Change your plans about us , your servants .
Satisfy us every morning with your loving kindness so that we may sing for joy and rejoice all our days .
Make us rejoice for as many days as you have made us suffer , for as many years as we have experienced evil .
Let your servants see what you can do . Let our children see your majesty .
Let the kindness of Jehovah our God be with us . Confirm for us the work of our hands . Yes , confirm the work of our hands .
He who lives under the shelter of the Most High will remain in the shadow of the Almighty .
I will say to Jehovah : » You are my refuge and my fortress , my God in whom I trust . «
He is the one who will rescue you from the bird hunter’s trap fowler’s snare and from deadly plagues .
He will cover you with his pinions , and under his wings you will find refuge . His truth is your shield and armor .
You will not be afraid of the terror of the night and arrows that fly during the day ,
plagues that roam the dark , epidemics that strike at noon .
They will not come near you , even though a thousand may fall dead beside you or ten thousand at your right side .
You only have to look with your eyes to see the punishment of wicked people .
» You , O Jehovah , are my refuge ! « You have made the Most High your home .
No harm will come to you . No sickness will come near your house .
He will put his angels in charge of you to protect you in all your ways .
They will carry you in their hands so that you never strike your foot against a rock .
You will step on lions and cobras . You will trample underfoot young lions and snakes .
Because you love me , I will rescue you . I will protect you because you know my name .
When you call to me , I will answer you . I will be with you when you are in trouble . I will deliver you and honor you .
I will satisfy you with a long life . I will show you my salvation .
It is good to give thanks to Jehovah , to sing praises to your name , O Most High .

It is good to declare your loving kindness in the morning and your faithfulness at night .
To do this on a ten-stringed instrument with a melody on a harp .
You made me find joy in what you have done , O Jehovah . I will sing joyfully about the works of your hands .
How great spectacular excellent are your works , O Jehovah ! How very deep are your thoughts !
A stupid senseless person cannot know and a fool cannot understand .
Wicked people sprout like grass and all troublemakers flourish . Yet they will be destroyed forever .
But you , O Jehovah , are highly honored forever .
Now look at your enemies , O Jehovah . They disappear and all troublemakers are scattered .
But you exalt my horn make me as strong as a wild bull . I have been anointed with soothing lotion .
My eyes gloat over those who spy on me . My ears hear the evildoers attacking me .
Righteous people flourish like palm trees and grow tall like the cedars in Lebanon .
They are planted in Jehovah’s house . They blossom in our God's courtyards .
Even when they are old , they still bear fruit . They are always healthy and fresh .
They make it known that Jehovah is upright . He is my rock . He is never unrighteous .
Jehovah reigns and he is clothed with majesty . Jehovah has girded himself with strength . The world also is established , that it cannot be moved .
Your throne is established from of old . You are from everlasting .
The floods have lifted up , O Jehovah , the floods have lifted up their voice ; the floods lift up their pounding waves .
Jehovah on high is mightier than the noise of many waters . Yes he is mightier than the mighty waves of the sea .
Your testimonies are very sure : holiness adorns your house , O Jehovah , forever .
O Jehovah , God of vengeance , God of vengeance , shine forth !
Rise up , O Judge of the earth , Render recompense to the proud .
O Jehovah , how long shall the wicked exult ?
They utter speech . They speak arrogantly . All troublemakers brag about themselves .
They crush your people , O Jehovah . They make those who belong to you suffer .
They kill widows and foreigners , and they murder orphans .
They say : Jehovah does not see it . The God of Jacob does not even pay attention to it .
Pay attention , you stupid senseless people ! When will you become wise , you fools ?
God created ears . Do you think he cannot hear ? He formed eyes . Do you think he cannot see ?
He disciplines nations . Do you think he cannot punish ? He teaches people . Do you think he does not know anything ?
Jehovah knows the thoughts of man . He knows that they a mere vanity .
Jehovah , how happy are those you instruct , the ones to whom you teach your law !
You give them rest from days of trouble until a pit is dug to trap the wicked .
Jehovah will not abandon his people . He will not desert those who belong to him .
For judgment will again be righteous . The upright in heart will follow it .
Who will stand up for me against evildoers ? Who will take his stand for me against those who do wickedness ?
If Jehovah had not been my help , I would have been silent in death .
If I should say : My foot has slipped , your loving kindness , O Jehovah , will hold me up .
When I worried about many things , your assuring words comforted me .
Can wicked rulers be allied with you ? They frame mischief by decree the law .
They join forces to take the lives of righteous people . They condemn innocent people to death .
Jehovah has become my stronghold . My God has become my rock of refuge .
He has turned their wickedness against them . He will destroy them because of their sins . Jehovah our God will destroy them .
Oh come , let us sing to Jehovah . Let us make a joyful noise to the Rock of our salvation .
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving , and make a joyful noise to him with psalms .
For Jehovah is a great God , and a great King above all gods .
Deep places of the earth are in his hand . The strength of the mountains is also His .
The sea is his . He made it and his hands formed the dry land .
Come , let us worship and bow down . Let us kneel before Jehovah our maker .
For he is our God , and we are the people of his pasture , and the sheep of his hand . Today hear His voice !
Do not harden your hearts , as in the day of strife , as in the day of testing in the wilderness .
Your fathers tempted me , tested me , and saw my work .
For forty years I was grieved with this generation . I said : » It is a people who go astray in their hearts , and they have not known my ways . «
I swore to them in my anger that they should not enter into my rest .
Sing to Jehovah a new song . Sing to Jehovah , all the earth .
Sing to Jehovah , bless his name ! Declare the good news of his salvation from day to day .
Proclaim his glory among the nations , his wonders among all people .
For Jehovah is great , and greatly to be praised ! He should be reverenced above all gods .
For all the gods of the nations are idols ; but Jehovah made the heavens .
Honor and majesty are before him . Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary .
Give to Jehovah , you families of the people . Give to Jehovah glory and strength .
Give to Jehovah the glory due to his name . Bring an offering and come into his courts .
Worship Jehovah in the beauty of holiness ; tremble before him , all the earth .
Say among the nations , Jehovah reigns ; and the world shall be established ; it shall not be moved ; He shall judge the peoples in uprightness .
Let the heavens rejoice , and let the earth be glad ; let the sea roar , and the fullness of it .
Let the field be joyful , and all that is in it ! Then all the trees of the forest will rejoice .
He comes before Jehovah ! Yes , he comes to judge the earth ! He will judge the world with righteousness , and the people with His truth fidelity faithfulness .
Jehovah reigns ! Let the earth rejoice and let the multitude of islands be glad .
Clouds , gloom and darkness are all around Him . Righteousness and judgment are the foundation of his throne .
A fire goes before him and burns up his enemies round about .
His lightning lights up the world . The earth sees and trembles .
The mountains melted like wax at the presence of Jehovah , at the presence of Jehovah of the whole earth .
The heavens declare his righteousness , and all the people see his glory .
All those who serve graven images are put to shame . Those who boast themselves in idols and all God-like ones bow down before Him .
Zion heard and was glad . The daughters of Judah rejoiced because of your judgments , O Jehovah .
For You , Jehovah , are high above all the earth . You are lifted on high far above all God-like ones .
You who love Jehovah hate evil ! He preserves his anointed ones . He delivers them out of the hand of the wicked .
Light is sown for the righteous , and gladness for the upright in heart .
Rejoice in Jehovah , you righteous ones ; and give thanks at the memory of his holy name .
Sing a new song to Jehovah for he has done miraculous things . His right hand and his holy arm have gained victory for him .
Jehovah has made his salvation known . He has uncovered his righteousness for the nations to see .
He remembered his loving kindness and faithfulness to Israel's descendants . All the ends of the earth have seen how our God saves them .
Shout joyfully to Jehovah all the earth . Break out into joyful singing , and make music .
Make music to Jehovah with a lyre and with the melody of a psalm .
Make music with trumpets and the playing of a ram's horn . Shout happily in the presence of the king , Jehovah .
Let the sea and everything in it , the world and those who live in it roar like thunder .
Let the rivers clap their hands and the mountains sing joyfully .
This is in Jehovah’s presence because he is coming to judge the earth . He will judge the world with righteousness and its people with fairness .
Jehovah reigns ! Let the peoples tremble . He is enthroned above the cherubim . Let the earth shake !
Jehovah is great in Zion ! He is exalted above all the peoples .
Let them praise your great and awesome name ! He is holy .
The strength of the King loves justice . You have established equity . You have executed justice and righteousness in Jacob .
Exalt Jehovah our God and worship at his footstool ! He is holy .
Moses and Aaron were among his priests . Samuel was among those who called on his name . They called upon Jehovah and he answered them .
He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud . They kept His testimonies and the commandment that he gave them .
O Jehovah our God , you answered them . You were a forgiving God to them , and an avenger of their evil deeds .
Exalt Jehovah our God and worship at his holy mountain , for Jehovah our God is holy .
Make a joyful noise sound shout to Jehovah , all you lands !
Serve Jehovah with gladness and come before his presence with a joyful song .
Know that Jehovah is God . He has made us , and not we ourselves . We are his people , and the sheep of his pasture .
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving , into his courtyard with praise : thank him and bless his name .
For Jehovah is good . His loving kindness is everlasting and his truth endures to all generations .
I will sing of loving kindness and judgment . I will sing to you O Jehovah .
I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way . O when will you come to me ? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart .
I will set no wicked thing before my eyes . I hate the work of unfaithful people . I want no part of it .
A perverse heart shall depart from me . I will not know a wicked person .
I will destroy anyone who secretly slanders his neighbor . I will not tolerate anyone with a conceited look or arrogant heart .
My eyes will be watching the faithful people in the land so that they may live with me . The person who lives with integrity will serve me .
The one who does deceitful things will not stay in my home . The one who tells lies will not remain in my presence .
Every morning I will destroy all the wicked people in the land to rid Jehovah’s city of all troublemakers .
Hear my prayer , O Jehovah ! And let my cry for help come to you .

Do not hide your face from me in the day of my distress . Incline your ear to me . In the day when I call answer me quickly .
My days have been consumed in smoke , and my bones have been scorched like a hearth .
My heart has been stricken like grass and has withered away . In fact I forget to eat my bread .
Because of the loudness of my groaning my bones cling to my flesh .
I resemble a pelican of the wilderness . I have become like an owl of the waste places .
I lie awake , I have become like a lonely bird on a housetop .
All day long my enemies have reproached me . Those who deride me used my name as a curse .
For I have eaten ashes like bread and mingled my drink with weeping .
This is because of your indignation and your anger . You have lifted me up and cast me away .
My days are like a lengthened shadow and I wither away like grass .
But You , O Jehovah , remain forever . Your name is for all generations .
You will arise and have compassion on Zion . It is time to be gracious to her for the appointed time has come .
Your servants find pleasure in her stones and feel pity for her dust .
So the nations will respect the name of Jehovah and all the kings of the earth will honor you .
For Jehovah has built up Zion . He has appeared in His glory .
He has respected the prayer of the destitute and has not despised their prayer .
This will be written for the generation to come : That a people yet to be created may praise Jehovah .
He looked down from his holy height . Jehovah gazed upon the earth from heaven .
He heard the groaning of the prisoner , to set free those who were doomed to death .
Let men tell of the Jehovah’s name in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem ,
When the peoples and kingdoms are gathered together to serve Jehovah .
He has weakened my strength in the way and has shortened my days .
I say : » O my God , do not take me away in the middle of my days , your years are throughout all generations .
» You founded the earth of old . The heavens are the work of your hands .
» They will perish , but you endure . All of them will wear out like a garment ; like clothing you will renew them and they will be renewed .
» But you are the same . Your years will not come to an end .
» The children of your servants will continue , and their descendants will be established before you . «
Bless Jehovah with all my being . With all that I am I praise his holy name !
With all my heart I praise Jehovah ! Do not forget how kind he has been .
He forgives all your iniquities and heals all your diseases .
He redeems your life from ruin and crowns you with loving-kindness and tender mercies .
He satisfies you with good ; your youth is renewed like the eagles .
Jehovah works righteousness and judgment for all who are oppressed .
He made known his ways to Moses , His deeds to the sons of Israel .
Jehovah is merciful and gracious . He is slow to anger , and rich in loving-kindness .
He will not always chasten , nor will he keep his anger forever .
He has not dealt with us according to our sins . He has not requited us according to our iniquities .
For as the heavens are high above the earth , so is his mercy toward those who reverence him .
As far as the east is from the west , so far has he removed our transgressions from us . as far as the sunrise is from the sunset farther then one could ever travel
Jehovah has compassion for those who reverence him just as a father has compassion for his children .
For he knows our conception and he remembers that we are dust .
Man’s days are as grass ; as a flower of the field , so he flourishes .
The wind passes over it , and it is gone ; and its place shall know it no more .
But the loving kindness of Jehovah is from everlasting to everlasting on those who reverence him , and his righteousness is to the sons of sons .
It is to those who keep his covenant , and to those who remember to do his commandments .
Jehovah has prepared his throne in the heavens . His kingdom rules over all .
Bless Jehovah you angels of his , you who excel in strength , who obey his command , and listen to the voice of his Word .
Bless Jehovah all his hosts . Bless Jehovah you ministers of his who do his will .
Bless Jehovah , all his works in all places he rules . Bless Jehovah with all my being .
Bless Jehovah with all my being ! O Jehovah my God , You are very great ! You are clothed with splendor and majesty .
You cover yourself with light as with a cloak . You stretch out clouds in the sky like a curtain .
You lay the beams of your upper chambers in the waters . You make the clouds your chariot . You walk upon the wings of the wind .
You make the winds your messengers , the flaming fire your ministers .
You established the earth upon its foundations , so that it will not be unstable forever .
You covered it with the deep like a garment . The waters stood above the mountains .
They fled at your rebuke . At the sound of your thunder they hurried away .
The mountains rose and the valleys sank down to the place you appointed for them .
You set a boundary that they may not go beyond . They will not return to cover the earth .
You send watering springs to the valleys . They flow between the mountains .
They give drink to every beast of the field . The wild donkeys quench their thirst .
Beside them the birds of the heavens dwell . They lift up voices among the branches .
You water the mountains from your upper chambers . The earth is satisfied with the fruit of your works .
You cause the grass to grow for the cattle and vegetation for the labor of man . That he may bring forth food from the earth ,
And wine which makes man's heart glad . That he may make his face shine with oil , and food , which sustains man's heart .
Jehovah’s trees drink their fill , the cedars of Lebanon which he planted ,
Where the birds build their nests , the stork , whose home is the fir tree .
The high mountains are for the wild goats . The cliffs are a refuge for the rock badgers .
You made the moon for the seasons . The sun knows the place of its setting .
You appoint darkness and it becomes night , when all the forest animals prowl about .
The young lions roar after their prey and seek their food from God .
They withdraw at sunrise and lie down in their dens .
Man goes to his work and to his labor until evening .
O Jehovah , how many are your works ! In wisdom you have made them all . The earth is full of your possessions .
The sea is so big and wide with many creatures , living things both large and small .
Ships sail on it , and Leviathan great sea animal , which you made , plays in it .
All of them wait for you to give them their food at the proper time .
You give it to them , and they gather it up . You open your hand , and they are satisfied with many blessings .
You hide your face , and they are frightened . You take away their breath , and they die and return to dust .
You send out your Spirit , and they are created . You renew the face of the earth .
Let the glory of Jehovah endure forever . May Jehovah find joy in his works .
He looks at the earth , and it trembles . He touches the mountains , and they smoke .
I will sing to Jehovah throughout my life . I will make music to praise my God as long as I live .
May my thoughts be pleasing to him . I will find joy in Jehovah .
Let sinners be consumed from the world . Let the wicked no longer exist . Bless Jehovah with all my being ! Praise Jehovah !
O give thanks to Jehovah ! Call upon his name . Make his work known among the people .
Sing to him , give praise to him ! Declare all his wondrous works .
Praise his holy name ! Let the heart of those rejoice who seek Jehovah .
Seek Jehovah and seek his strength . Seek his presence constantly !
Remember the marvelous works that he has done , his wonders , and the judgments of his mouth .
You seed of Abraham his servant , you children of Jacob his chosen ones .
He is Jehovah our God : his judgments are in all the earth .
He has remembered his covenant forever ! It is the word he commanded to a thousand generations .
He made this covenant with Abraham and gave his oath to Isaac .
He confirmed the same to Jacob for a law , and to Israel for an everlasting covenant .
He said : » I will give the land of Canaan , the lot of your inheritance to you . «
They were a few men in number , very few , and strangers in it .
They went from one nation to another , from one kingdom to another people .
He permitted no man to do them wrong and he reproved kings for their sakes .
He said : » Do not touch my anointed , and do my prophets no harm . «
Furthermore , he called for a famine on the land : he broke the whole staff of bread .
He sent a man before them , Joseph , who was sold for a servant .
Whose feet they hurt with fetters : he was laid in iron :
Jehovah’s presence tested him through fiery trials until the time that his word came .
The king sent someone to release him . The ruler of nations set him free .
He made Joseph the master of his palace and the ruler of all his possessions .
Joseph trained the king's officers the way he wanted and taught his respected leaders wisdom .
Then Israel came to Egypt . Jacob lived as a foreigner in the land of Ham .
Jehovah made his people grow rapidly in number and stronger than their enemies .
He changed their minds so that they hated his people , and they dealt treacherously with his servants .
He sent his servant Moses , and he sent Aaron , whom he had chosen .
They displayed his miraculous signs among them and did amazing things in the land of Ham .
He sent darkness and made their land dark . They did not rebel against his orders .
He turned their water into blood and caused their fish to die .
He made their land swarm with frogs , even in the kings' bedrooms .
He spoke , and swarms of flies and gnats infested their entire territory .
He gave them hail and lightning instead of rain throughout their land .
He struck their grapevines and fig trees and smashed the trees in their territory .
He spoke , and countless locusts and grasshoppers came .
They devoured all the plants in the land . They devoured the crops in the fields .
He killed all the firstborn sons , the first ones born in the land when their fathers were young .
He brought Israel out with silver and gold , and no one among his tribes stumbled .
The Egyptians were terrified of Israel , so they were glad when Israel left .
He spread out a cloud as a protective covering and a fire to light up the night .
The Israelites asked , and he brought them quail and filled them with bread from heaven .
He opened a rock , and water flowed like a river through the dry places .
He remembered his holy word to his servant Abraham .
He brought his people out with joy , his chosen ones with a song of joy .
He gave them the lands of other nations . They inherited what others had worked for .
Then they would obey his laws and follow his teachings . Praise Jehovah !
Praise Jehovah ! Oh give thanks to Jehovah , for he is good and His loving-kindness endures forever .
Who can speak of the mighty acts deeds of Jehovah ? Who can proclaim and perceive all his praise ?
How blessed are those who pay attention to justice , who practice righteousness at all times !
Remember me , O Jehovah , with favor toward your people . Visit me with your salvation .
Help me see the prosperity of your chosen ones that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation , that I may glory with your inheritance .
We have sinned like our fathers ! We have committed iniquity and have behaved wickedly .
Our fathers in Egypt did not understand your wonders . They did not remember your abundant kindnesses . But they rebelled by the Red Sea .
Nevertheless he saved them for the sake of his name that he might make his power known .
So he rebuked the Red Sea and it dried up , and he led them through the deeps , as through the wilderness .
He saved them from the hand of the one who hated them and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy .
The waters covered their adversaries and not one of them was left .
Then they believed his words . They sang His praise .
They quickly forgot his works and they did not wait for his counsel .
They had an unreasonable desire for food in the wilderness . In the desert they tested God .
He gave them what they asked for . He also gave them a degenerative disease .
In the camp certain men became envious of Moses . They also became envious of Aaron , Jehovah’s holy one .
The ground split open and swallowed Dathan . It buried Abiram's followers .
A fire broke out among their followers . Flames burned up wicked people .
At Mount Horeb they made a statue of a calf . They worshiped an idol made of metal .
They traded their glorious God for the statue of a bull that eats grass .
They forgot the God of their salvation , the one who did spectacular things in Egypt ,
miracles in the land of Ham , and terrifying things at the Red Sea .
God said he was going to destroy them , but Moses , his chosen one , stood in his way to prevent him from exterminating them .
They refused to enter the pleasant land . They did not believe what he said .
They complained in their tents . They did not obey Jehovah .
Raising his hand , he swore that he would kill them in the wilderness ,
kill their descendants among the nations , and scatter them throughout various lands .
They joined in worshiping the god Baal while they were at Peor . They ate what was sacrificed to the dead .
They infuriated God by what they did , and a plague broke out among them .
Phinehas stood between God and the people , and the plague was stopped .
Because of this , Phinehas was considered righteous forever , throughout every generation .
They made God angry by the water at Meribah . Things turned out badly for Moses because of what they did .
They made him bitter so that he spoke recklessly .
They did not destroy the people as Jehovah had told them .
Instead , they intermarried with other nations . They learned to do what other nations did .
They worshiped their idols , which became a trap for them .
They sacrificed their sons and daughters to demons .
They shed innocent blood , the blood of their own sons and daughters whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan . The land became polluted with blood .
They became filthy because of what they did . They behaved like prostitutes .
Jehovah burned with anger against his own people . He was disgusted with those who belonged to him .
He handed them over to other nations , and those who hated them ruled them .
Their enemies oppressed them and made them subject to their power .
He rescued them many times , but they continued to plot rebellion against him and to sink deeper because of their sin .
He saw that they were suffering when he heard their cry for help .
He remembered his promise to them . In keeping with his rich mercy , he changed his plans .
He let them find compassion from all those who held them captive .
Rescue us , O Jehovah our God , and gather us from the nations so that we may give thanks to your holy name and make your praise our glory .
Thanks be to Jehovah the God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting . Let all the people say amen . Praise Jehovah !
Give thanks to Jehovah , for he is good . His loving kindness endures forever .
Let the redeemed by Jehovah say so , whom he has redeemed from the hand of the adversary ,
And gathered out of the lands , from the east sunrise and from the west sunset , from the north and from the south .
They wandered in the wilderness in a desolate way . They found no city to live in .
Hungry and thirsty , they fainted within .
Then they cried to Jehovah in their trouble . He delivered them out of their distress .
He led them also by a straight way that they might go to a city to live in .
Let them praise Jehovah for his loving kindness , for his wonderful works to the children of men !
For he satisfies the thirsty and the hungry person .
Those who lived in the dark , in death's shadow were prisoners in misery . They were held in iron chains
They had rebelled against God's words and had despised the advice given by the Most High .
He humbled them with hard work . They fell down , but no one was there to help them .
In their distress they cried out to Jehovah . He saved them from their troubles .
He brought them out of the dark , out of death's shadow . He broke apart their chains .
Let them give thanks to Jehovah because of his goodness . He performed his miracles for the sons of men .
He shattered bronze gates and cut iron bars in two .
Fools suffered because of their disobedience and because of their crimes .
All food was disgusting to them , and they came near death's gates .
In their distress they cried out to Jehovah . He saved them from their troubles .
He sent his message and healed them . He rescued them from the grave .
Let them give thanks to Jehovah because of his goodness . He performed his miracles for the sons of men .
Let them bring songs of thanksgiving as their sacrifice . Let them tell in joyful songs what he has done .
Those who sail on the sea in ships , who do business on the high seas ,
have seen what Jehovah can do , the miracles he performed in the depths of the sea .
He spoke , and a storm began to blow , and it made the waves rise high .
The sailors aboard ship rose toward the sky . They plunged into the depths . Their courage failed in the face of disaster .
They reeled and staggered like drunks , and all their skills as sailors became useless .
In their distress they cried out to Jehovah . He led them from their troubles .
He made the storm calm down , and the waves became still .
The sailors were glad that the storm was quiet . He guided them to the harbor they had longed for .
Let them give thanks to Jehovah because of his goodness . He performed his miracles for the sons of men .
Let them glorify him when the people are gathered for worship . Let them praise him in the company of respected leaders .
He changes rivers into a desert , springs into thirsty ground ,
and fertile ground into a layer of salt because of the wickedness of the people living there .
He changes deserts into lakes marshland and dry ground into springs .
There he settles those who are hungry , and they build cities to live in .
They plant in fields and vineyards that produce crops .
He blesses them , and their numbers multiply , and he does not allow a shortage of cattle .
They became few in number and were humiliated because of oppression , disaster , and sorrow .
He poured contempt on their influential people and made them stumble around in a pathless desert .
He lifts needy people high above suffering and makes their families like flocks .
The righteous will see this and rejoice , but all the wicked will shut their mouths .
Let those who think they are wise pay attention to these things so they will understand the loving kindness of Jehovah .
O God , my heart is faithful stable fixed . I will sing and give praise with my entire being .

Awake , lute and harp for I will awake early .
I will praise you , O Jehovah , among the people . I will sing praises to you among the nations .
Your loving kindness is higher then the heavens . Your truth reaches unto the clouds .
Be exalted , O God , above the heavens : and your glory above all the earth .
Save us with your powerful hand great power , and answer us so that those who are dear to you may be rescued .
God has spoken in his holiness : I will rejoice , I will divide Shechem , and mete out the valley of Succoth .
Gilead is mine ; Manasseh is mine ; Ephraim also is the strength of my head ; Judah is my lawgiver ;
Moab is my wash pot ; over Edom will I cast out my shoe ; over Philistia will I triumph .
Who will bring me into the strong city ? Who will lead me into Edom ?
Will you O God , who cast us off ? Will you O God , go forth with our hosts ?
Give us help against the enemy , for man’s help is in vain .
Through God we shall have great strength : for he shall tread down our enemies .
O God , whom I praise , do not be silent .
Wicked and deceitful people have opened their mouths against me . They speak against me with lying tongues .
They surround me with hateful words . They fight against me without reason .
In return for my love , they accuse me , but I pray for them .
They reward me with evil instead of good and with hatred instead of love .
Appoint the evil one to oppose him . Let an accuser stand at his right hand .
When he stands trial , let him be found guilty . Let his prayer be considered sinful .
Let his days be few in number . Let someone else take his place .
Let his children become fatherless and his wife a widow .
Let his children wander around and beg . Let them seek help far from their ruined homes .
Let a creditor take everything he owns . Let strangers steal what he has worked for .
Let no one be kind to him anymore . Let no one show any pity to his fatherless children .
Let his descendants be cut off and their family name be wiped out by the next generation .
Let Jehovah remember the guilt of his ancestors and not wipe out his mother's sin .
Let their guilt and sin always remain on record in front of Jehovah . Let Jehovah remove every memory of him from the earth ,
for he did not remember to be kind . He drove oppressed , needy , and brokenhearted people to their graves .
He loved to put curses on others , so he , too , was cursed . He did not like to bless others , so he never received a blessing .
He wore cursing as though it were clothing ; so cursing entered his body like water and his bones like oil .
Let cursing be his clothing , a belt he always wears .
This is how Jehovah rewards those who accuse me , those who say evil things against me .
O Lord Jehovah , deal with me out of the goodness of your name . Rescue me because of your loving kindness .
I am oppressed and needy . I feel pain in my heart .
I fade away like a lengthening shadow . I have been shaken off like a grasshopper .
My knees give way because I have been fasting . My body has become lean , without any fat .
I have become the victim of my enemies' insults . They look at me and shake their heads .
Help me , O Jehovah my God . Save me because of your loving kindness .
Then they will know that this is your doing , that you , O Jehovah , are the one who saved me .
They may curse , but you will bless . Let those who attack me be ashamed , but let your servant rejoice .
Let those who accuse me wear disgrace as though it were clothing . Let them be wrapped in their shame as though it were a robe .
With my mouth I will give many thanks to Jehovah . I will praise him among many people .
He stands at the right hand of the needy people to save them from those who would condemn them to death .
Jehovah said to my Lord : » Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet . «
Jehovah will extend your powerful scepter from Zion . He will say : » Rule in the midst of your enemies . «
Your people will volunteer in the day of your power . Your young people will come to you in holy splendor like dew from the womb of the dawn in the early morning .
Jehovah has taken an oath and will not change his mind : » You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek . «
Jehovah is at your right hand . He will crush kings in the day of his anger .
He will pass judgment on the nations and fill them with dead bodies . Throughout the earth he will execute their rulers .
He will drink from the brook along the road . He will hold his head high .
Praise Jehovah ! I will praise Jehovah with all my heart in the company of the upright and in the congregation .
Jehovah’s deeds are spectacular . They are studied by all who enjoy them .
His work is glorious and majestic . His righteousness endures continues forever .
He has made his miracles unforgettable . Jehovah is gracious and compassionate .
He provides food for those who reverence him . He always remembers his covenant .
He has revealed the power of his works to his people by giving them the lands of other nations as an inheritance .
His works are done with truth and justice . All his guiding principles are trustworthy .
They last are upheld forever and ever . They are carried out with truth and decency .
He has sent deliverance to his people . He has ordered that his covenant should continue forever . His name is holy and awesome .
The respect and reverence for Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom . All who obey his commandments show good sense insight and understanding . His praise endures continues forever .
Praise Jehovah ! Blessed is the person who respects Jehovah and is happy to obey his commandments .
His descendants will grow strong on the earth . The family of the upright will be blessed .
Wealth and riches will be in his home . His righteousness continues forever .
Light shines in the darkness for the upright . He is gracious , compassionate , and fair .
All goes well for the person who is generous and lends willingly . He earns an honest living .
He will never be shaken . The righteous will be remembered .
He is not afraid of bad news . His heart remains secure , full of confidence in Jehovah .
His heart is steady , and he is not afraid . In the end he will look triumphantly at his enemies .
He gives freely to poor . His righteousness continues forever . His head is raised in honor .
The wicked sees this and becomes angry . He angrily grits his teeth and disappears . The hope of the wicked will perish be destroyed .
Praise Jehovah ! You servants of Jehovah , praise him . Praise the name of Jehovah .
Blessed is the name of Jehovah from now and forever .
From sunrise to sunset , the name of Jehovah should be praised . Everywhere and all the time , Jehovah’s name should be praised .
Jehovah is high above all the nations . His glory is above the heavens .
Who is like Jehovah our God ? He is seated on his high throne .
He bends down humbles himself to look at heaven and earth .
He lifts the poor from the dust . He lifts the needy from a garbage heap .
He seats them with important people , with the leaders princes of his people .
He makes a childless woman a joyful mother . Praise Jehovah !
When Israel left Egypt , when Jacob's family left people who spoke a foreign language ,
Judah became his holy place and Israel became his government .
The Red Sea looked at this and ran away . The Jordan River turned back .
The mountains jumped like rams . The hills jumped like lambs .
Red Sea , why did you run away ? Jordan River , what made you turn back ?
Mountains , what made you jump like rams ? Hills , what made you jump like lambs ?
Earth , tremble and shake in the presence of Jehovah , in the presence of the God of Jacob .
He turns a rock into a pool filled with water and turns flint into a spring flowing with water .
Do not give glory to us , O Jehovah . Do not give glory to us . Give glory to your name because of your loving kindness and faithfulness .
Why should other nations say : » Where is their God ? «
Our God is in heaven . He does whatever he pleases .
Their idols are made of silver and gold . Human hands made them .
They have mouths , but they cannot speak . They have eyes , but they cannot see .
They have ears , but they cannot hear . They have noses , but they cannot smell .
They have hands , but they cannot feel . They have feet , but they cannot walk . They cannot even make a sound with their throats .
Those who make idols end up like them . So does everyone who trusts them .
O Israel , trust Jehovah . He is your helper and your shield .
O Descendants of Aaron , trust Jehovah . He is your helper and your shield .
If you reverence and respect Jehovah , trust Jehovah . He is your helper and your shield .
Jehovah is always thinking about us . He will bless us . He will bless the descendants of Israel . He will bless the descendants of Aaron .
He will bless those who reverence and respect Jehovah , from the least important to the most important .
May Jehovah continue to bless you and your children .
Jehovah , the maker of heaven and earth , will bless you .
The highest heaven belongs to Jehovah , but he has given the earth to the sons of men .
Those who are dead do not praise Jehovah , nor do those who go into the silence of the grave .
We will bless Jehovah now and forever . Praise Jehovah !
I love Jehovah because he hears my voice when I pray .
I will call on him as long as I live because he turns his ear toward me listens to me .
The ropes of death became tangled around me . The fear of the grave took hold of me . I experienced pain and agony .
But I called on the name of Jehovah : » Please , Jehovah , deliver rescue me ! «
Jehovah is gracious and righteous . Our God is compassionate merciful .
Jehovah protects defenseless people simple ones . When I was weak , he saved me .
I will be at peace again because Jehovah has been good to you .
You saved me from death . You saved my eyes from tears and my feet from stumbling .
I will walk in Jehovah’s presence in the land of the living .
I kept my faith even when I said : I am suffering terribly .
I also said when I was panic-stricken : » All men are liars . «
How can I repay Jehovah for all the good that he has done for me ?
I will take the cup of salvation and call on the name of Jehovah .
I will keep my vows to Jehovah in the presence of all his people .
Precious in the sight of Jehovah is the death of his godly holy ones .
O Jehovah , I am indeed your servant . I am your servant , the son of your handmaid . You have freed me from my chains .
I will bring a song of thanksgiving to you as a sacrifice . I will call on the name of Jehovah .
I will keep my vows to Jehovah in the presence of all his people ,
in the courtyards of Jehovah’s house , in the middle of Jerusalem . Praise Jehovah !
Praise Jehovah , all you nations ! Praise him , all you people of the world !
His loving kindness toward us is powerful . Jehovah’s truth endures forever . Praise Jehovah !
O Give thanks to Jehovah because he is good and his loving kindness is eternal .
Let the people of Israel say : » His loving kindness is eternal . «
Let the priests of God say : » His loving kindness is eternal . «
Let all who worship him say : » His loving kindness is eternal . «
In my distress I called to Jehovah ; he answered me and set me free .
Jehovah is with me , I will not be afraid ; what can man do to me ?
It is Jehovah who helps me , and I will see my enemies defeated .
It is better to trust in Jehovah than to depend on people .
It is better to trust in Jehovah than to depend on human leaders .
Many enemies were around me ; but I destroyed them by the power of Jehovah !
They were around me on every side ; but I destroyed them by the power of Jehovah !
They swarmed around me like bees , but they burned out as quickly as a brush fire ; by the power of Jehovah I destroyed them .
I was fiercely attacked and was being defeated , but Jehovah helped me .
Jehovah makes me powerful and strong ; he has saved me .
Listen to the glad shouts of victory in the tents of God's people : Jehovah’s mighty power has done it !
His power has brought us victory , his mighty power in battle !
I will not die ; instead , I will live and proclaim the works of Jehovah .
Jehovah has punished me severely , but he has not let me die .
Open the temple gate of righteousness to me and I will go in and give thanks to Jehovah !
This is the gate of Jehovah ; only the righteous can come in .
I praise you , Jehovah , because you heard me , because you have become my salvation .
The stone that the builders rejected as worthless turned out to be the most important of all .
Jehovah did this and what a wonderful sight it is !
This is the day Jehovah has made let us rejoice and be glad in it !
Save us , O Jehovah , save us ! Give us success , O Jehovah !
Blessed is he who comes in the name of Jehovah ! We have blessed you from the house of Jehovah .
Jehovah is God and he has given us light . Bind the festival sacrifice with cords to the horns of the altar .
You are my God , and I give you thanks . I will proclaim your greatness .
Give thanks to Jehovah , for he is good , and his loving kindness is eternal .
Blessed are those whose way is blameless . They walk in the law of Jehovah .
Blessed are those who obey his written word . They seek him with all their heart .
They also do no unrighteousness . They walk in his ways .
You have ordained your precepts that we should keep them diligently .
Oh that my ways may be established to keep your statutes !
I will not be ashamed when I look upon all your commandments .
I will give thanks to you with uprightness of heart , when I learn your righteous judgments .
I will obey your laws . Do not forsake me completely !
How can a young man keep his way pure ? By keeping it according to your word .
With all my heart I have sought you . Do not let me wander from your commandments .
Your word I have treasured in my heart that I may not sin against you .
You are blessed O Jehovah . Teach me your statutes .
With my lips I have told of all the ordinances of your mouth .
I have rejoiced in the way of your written word , as much as in all riches .
I will meditate on your precepts and regard your ways .
I shall delight in your statutes . I shall not forget your word !
Deal bountifully with your servant that I may live and keep your word .
Open my eyes that I may observe wonderful things from your law .
I am a stranger in the earth . Do not hide your commandments from me .
I am crushed and long for your ordinances at all times .
You rebuke the arrogant , the cursed , and all who wander from your commandments .
Take away reproach and shame from me , for I have obeyed your laws .
Even though princes sit and talk against me , your servant meditates on your statutes .
Your laws are my delight and counsel .
I cleave to the dust . Revive me according to your word as you promised .
I have told of my ways , and you have answered me . Teach me your statutes .
Make me understand the way of your precepts that I may meditate on your miracles .
I weep because of grief ; strengthen me according to your word as you promised .
Remove the false way from me , and graciously grant me your law .
I have chosen the faithful way ! I have placed your ordinances before me .

Remember the word to your servant , in which you have made me hope .
This is my comfort in my affliction : That your word has revived me .
The arrogant utterly deride me , yet I do not turn aside from your law .
I have remembered your ordinances from of old , O Jehovah , and comfort myself .
Righteous indignation controls me because of the wicked . They forsake your law !
Your statutes are my songs in the house of my pilgrimage .
O Jehovah , I remember your name in the night , and keep your law .
This has become mine , that I observe your precepts .
Jehovah is my portion ; I have promised to keep your words .
I sought your favor with all my heart . Be gracious to me as you promise in your word .
I considered my ways and turned my feet to your laws .
I hurried and did not delay to keep your commandments .
The cords of the wicked have encircled me . But I have not forgotten your law .
At midnight I shall rise to give thanks to you for your righteous ordinances .
I am a companion of all those who reverence you and keep your precepts .
The earth is full of your loving kindness ! O Jehovah teach me your statutes .
You have dealt well with your servant , O Jehovah , according to your word .
Teach me goodness , discernment and knowledge , for I believe in your commandments .
Before I was afflicted I went astray , but now I keep your word .
You are good and do good . Teach me your statutes .
The arrogant have forged a lie against me . With all my heart I will observe your precepts .
Their heart is like fat callous and without feeling , But I delight in your law .
It is good for me that I was afflicted , that I may learn your statutes .
The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver pieces .
Your hands made me and fashioned me . Give me understanding , that I may learn your commandments .
May those who fear you see me and be glad , for I wait for your word .
I know , O Jehovah , that your judgments are righteous , and that in faithfulness you have afflicted me .
O may your loving kindness comfort me as you promise in your word .
Let your compassion come to me that I may live , for your law is my delight .

Let those who respect you turn to me , even those who know your laws .
May my heart be blameless in your statutes so that I will not be ashamed .
I long for your salvation . I wait for your word .
My eyes fail with longing for your word , while I say : When will you comfort me ?
Though I have become like a wineskin in the smoke , I do not forget your statutes .
How many are the days of your servant ? When will you execute judgment on those who persecute me ?
The arrogant have dug pits for me . They are not in agreement with your law .
All your commandments are faithful . They have persecuted me with a lie ; help me !
They almost destroyed me on earth , but I did not forsake your precepts .
Revive me according to your loving kindness , so I may keep the law of your mouth you have spoken .
Forever , O Jehovah , your word is settled in heaven .
Your faithfulness is throughout all generations . You established the earth , and it stands .
They stand this day according to your ordinances , for all things are your servants .
If your law had not been my delight I would have perished in my affliction .
I will never forget your precepts . By them you have revived me .
I am yours , save me for I have sought your precepts .
The wicked wait for me to destroy me . I shall diligently consider your laws .
I have seen a limit to all perfection . Your commandment is exceedingly broad .
O How I love your law ! It is my meditation all day long .
Your commandments make me wiser than my enemies , for they are ever mine .
I have more insight than all my teachers , for your laws are my meditation .
I understand more than the aged , since I have observed your precepts .
I have restrained my feet from every evil way , that I may keep your word .
I have not turned aside from your ordinances just as you have instructed me .
How sweet are your words to my taste ! Sweeter than honey to my mouth !
I get understanding from your precepts . Therefore I hate every false way .
Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path .
I have sworn and I will confirm it : I will keep your righteous ordinances .
I am exceedingly afflicted . Revive me , O Jehovah , according to your word .
O accept the freewill offerings of my mouth , O Jehovah , and teach me your ordinances .
My life is continually in my hand , yet I do not forget your law .
The wicked have laid a snare for me , yet I have not gone astray from your precepts .
I have inherited your laws forever , for they are the joy of my heart .
I have inclined my heart to perform your statutes forever , to the end .

I am your servant ! Give me understanding that I may know your law .
It is time for Jehovah to act . They have broken your law .
Therefore I love your commandments more than gold , yes , more then fine gold .
That is why I esteem right all your precepts and I hate every false way .
Your laws are wonderful . Therefore I obey them !
The unfolding of your words gives light . It gives understanding to the simple .
I opened my mouth wide and panted , for I longed for your commandments .
Turn to me and be gracious to me , after your manner with those who love your name .
Establish my footsteps in your word , and do not let any iniquity have dominion over me .
Redeem me from the oppression of man , that I may keep your precepts .
Make your face shine upon your servant , and teach me your statutes .
My eyes shed streams of water , because they do not keep your law .
You are righteous , O Jehovah . Your judgments are upright .
You have commanded your laws in righteousness and in exceeding faithfulness .
My zeal has consumed me , for the reason that my adversaries have forgotten your words .
Your word is very pure . Your servant loves it .
I am small and despised . Even so I do not forget your precepts .
Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness . Your law is truth .
Trouble and anguish have come upon me . Even so I am fond of your commandments .
Your laws are righteous forever . Give me understanding that I may live .
I cried with all my heart . Answer me , O Jehovah ! I will observe your statutes .
I cried to you . Save me and I shall keep your laws .
I rise before dawn and cry for help . I wait for your words .
My eyes anticipate the night watches that I may meditate on your word .
Hear my voice according to your loving kindness . Revive me , O Jehovah , according to your ordinances .
Those who follow after wickedness draw near . They are far from your law .

Of old I have known from your laws that you have founded them forever .
Look upon my affliction and rescue me , for I do not forget your law .

Salvation is far from the wicked for they do not seek your statutes .
Great are your mercies , O Jehovah . Revive me according to your ordinances .

I behold the treacherous and loathe because they do not keep your word .

Your word is truth from the very beginning ! Every one of your righteous ordinances endures forever .
Powerful people persecute me without cause . Yet my heart stands in awe of your words .
I rejoice at your word as one who finds great treasure .
I hate and despise falsehood and I love your law .
Seven times a day I praise you ! This is because of your righteous ordinances .
Those who love your law have abundant peace . Nothing causes them to stumble .

Let Your hand be ready to help me . For I have chosen your precepts .
I long for your salvation , O Jehovah . Your law is my delight .
Let me live that it may praise you . May your ordinances help me .
I have gone astray like a lost sheep . Look for your servant for I have not forgotten your commandments .
When I was in trouble , I cried out to Jehovah , and he answered me .
O Jehovah , rescue me from lying lips and from a deceitful tongue .
You deceitful tongue , what can Jehovah give you ? What more can he do for you ?
He will give you a warrior's sharpened arrows and red-hot coals .
How horrible it is to live as a foreigner in Meshech or to stay in the tents of Kedar .
I have lived too long with those who hate peace .
I am for peace , but when I talk about it , they only talk about war .
I will lift up my eyes to the mountains from where my help comes .
My help comes from Jehovah , who made heaven and earth .
He will not allow your foot to slip . He who keeps you will not slumber .
Behold , He who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep .
Jehovah is your keeper . Jehovah is your shade on your right hand .
The sun will not strike you by day . The moon will not strike you by night .
Jehovah will protect you from all evil . He will protect preserve you .
May Jehovah guard your going out and your coming in from this time forth and forever .
I was glad when they said to me : » Let us go to the house of Jehovah . «
Our feet will stand inside your gates , Jerusalem .
Jerusalem is built to be a city where the people are united .
All of Jehovah’s tribes go to that city because it is a law in Israel to give thanks to the name of Jehovah .
The court of justice sits there . It consists of princes who are David's descendants .
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem : May those who love you prosper .
May there be peace inside your walls and prosperity in your palaces .
For the sake of my brothers and friends let me say : » May it go well for you ! «
For the sake of the house of Jehovah our God , I will seek what is good for you .
To You I lift up my eyes , O you who are enthroned in the heavens !
Behold , as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master , as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress , so our eyes look to Jehovah our God , until he is gracious to us .
Have mercy on us , O Jehovah , be gracious to us , for we are greatly filled with contempt .
We are filled with the scoffing of those who are at ease , and with the contempt of the proud .
» If Jehovah was not on our side , « let Israel now say :
» If Jehovah was not on our side when men rose up against us :
» Then they would have swallowed us up quickly , when their wrath was kindled against us .
» Then the waters would have overwhelmed us , yes the stream would have gone over us .
» Then the proud waters would flow over us .
» Blessed is Jehovah , who has not given us as a prey to their teeth .
» We escaped as a bird out of the trap of fowlers bird catchers . The trap is broken , and we have escaped .
» Our help is in the name of Jehovah , who made heaven and earth . «
They who trust in Jehovah are like Mount Zion . It is not shaken , but remains forever .
As the mountains are all around Jerusalem , so Jehovah is all around his people from this time and forever .
For the rod of the wicked shall not rest on the lot of the righteous in case the righteous put forth their hands to iniquity .
Do good , O Jehovah , to the good ones , and to the upright in their hearts .
Jehovah will lead those who turn away from their crooked ways with the workers of iniquity . Israel will have peace .
When Jehovah brought back the captive ones of Zion , it was like a dream .
Then our mouths were filled with laughter and our tongues with joyful songs . Then the nations said : » Jehovah has done spectacular things for them . «
Jehovah has done spectacular things for us . We are overjoyed .
Deliver us from captivity , O Jehovah , as you restore streams to dry riverbeds in the Negev .
Those who cry while they plant will joyfully sing while they harvest .
The person who goes out weeping , carrying his bag of seed , will come home singing , carrying his bundles of grain .
If Jehovah does not build the house , it is vain for the builders to work on it . If Jehovah does not protect a city , it is vain for the guard to stay alert .
It is vain to work hard for the food you eat by getting up early and going to bed late . Jehovah gives food to those he loves while they sleep .
Children are an inheritance from Jehovah . They are a blessing from him .
The children born to a man when he is young are like arrows in the hand of a warrior .
Blessed is the man who has filled his quiver with them . He will not be put to shame when he speaks with his enemies in the city gate .
Blessed are all who reverence Jehovah and live his way .
You will certainly eat what your own hands have provided . Blessings to you ! May things go well for you !
Your wife will be like a fruitful vine inside your home . Your children will be like young olive trees around your table .
This is how Jehovah will bless the person who fears him .
May Jehovah bless you from Zion so that you may see Jerusalem prosper all the days of your life .
May you live to see your children's children . Let there be peace in Israel !
» Many times they have persecuted me from my youth up , « Let Israel now say :
» Many times they have persecuted me from my youth up . Yet they have not prevailed against me .
» The plowers plowed upon my back . They lengthened their furrows . «
» Jehovah is righteous . He has cut to pieces the cords of the wicked .
May all who hate Zion be put to shame and turned backward .
Let them be like grass upon the housetops . It withers before it grows up .
The reaper does not fill his hand with it , or the binder of sheaves his bosom .
Nor do those who pass by say : » The blessing of Jehovah be upon you ! We bless you in the name of Jehovah . «
Out of the depths of despair I have cried to you , O Jehovah .
Jehovah , do hear my voice ! Let your ears listen to the voice of my supplications .
If You , Jehovah , should record our sins , O Jehovah , who could stand ?
But there is forgiveness with you , that you may be reverenced .
I wait for Jehovah , I do wait . And in his word I do hope .
I wait for Jehovah more than the watchmen for the morning . Yes , more than the watchmen for the morning .
O Israel hope in Jehovah ! For with Jehovah there is loving kindness . With him is abundant redemption .
He will save his people Israel from all their sins .
O Jehovah , my heart is not proud , my eyes are not haughty . I do not involve myself in great matters . I do not get involved in things too difficult for me .
Surely I am composed and quiet . I am like a weaned child who rests against his mother . Inside of me I am like a weaned child .
O Israel , hope in Jehovah from this time and forever .
Jehovah , remember David and all his affliction .
Remember how he swore an oath to Jehovah and made this vow to the Mighty One of Jacob .
He said : » I will not step inside my house ,
get into my bed , shut my eyes , or close my eyelids
until I find a place for Jehovah , a dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob . «
Now , we have heard about the Ark of the Covenant being in Ephrathah . We found it in Jaar .
Let us go to his dwelling place . Let us worship at his footstool .
O Jehovah , arise , and come to your resting place with the ark of your power .
Clothe your priests with righteousness . Let your godly ones sing with joy .
For the sake of your servant David do not reject your anointed one .
Jehovah swore an oath to David : » This is a truth he will not take back : I will set one of your own descendants on your throne .
» If your sons are faithful to my covenant and my written instructions that I will teach them , then their descendants will also sit on your throne forever . «
Jehovah has chosen Zion . He wants it for his home .
This will be my resting place forever . Here I will sit enthroned because I want Zion .
I will greatly bless all that Zion needs . I will satisfy its needy people with food .
I will clothe its priests with salvation . Then its godly ones will sing joyfully .
There I will make the horn of David grow give mighty power to David . I will prepare a lamp light for my anointed one .
I will clothe his enemies with shame , but the crown on my anointed one will shine .
Behold , how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity !
It is like the precious oil upon the head , coming down upon the beard , Aaron's beard , coming down upon the edge of his robes .
It is like the dew of Hermon coming down upon the mountains of Zion . For there Jehovah commanded the blessing . It is life forever .
Bless Jehovah all you servants of Jehovah . You who serve by night in the house of Jehovah !
Lift up your hands in holiness and bless Jehovah .
May Jehovah bless you from Zion , he who made heaven and earth .
Praise Jehovah ! Praise the name of Jehovah . Praise him you servants of Jehovah .
You who stand in the house of Jehovah , in the courtyard of the house of our God ,
Praise Jehovah for Jehovah is good ! Sing praises to his name for it is delightful pleasant .
For Jehovah has chosen Jacob for Himself and Israel for his special treasure property .
For I know that Jehovah is great , and Jehovah is above all gods .
Everything Jehovah desires he does in the heavens and in earth , and in the seas and all deep places .
He causes the vapors to rise from the ends of the earth . He makes lightning for the rain . He brings wind out of his storehouses .
He destroyed the first-born of Egypt , both of man and animal .
He sent signs and wonders into your midst , O Egypt , on Pharaoh and on all his servants .
He struck great nations and killed mighty kings ,
Sihon the king of the Amorites , and Og king of Bashan , and all the kingdoms of Canaan ,
and gave their land as an inheritance , an inheritance to Israel His people .
Your name , O Jehovah , is forever , and your memorial , O Jehovah , throughout all generations .
For Jehovah will judge his people , and he will have pity on his servants .
The idols of the nations are silver and gold , the work of man's hands .
They have mouths , but they do not speak . They have eyes , but they do not see .
They have ears , but they do not hear . There is no breath in their mouths .
Those who make them will be like them , everyone who trusts in them .
Bless Jehovah , O house of Israel ; bless Jehovah , O house of Aaron ;
Bless Jehovah , O house of Levi . You who reverence Jehovah , bless Jehovah .
Blessed is Jehovah out of Zion , who dwells at Jerusalem . Praise Jehovah !
Give thanks to Jehovah , for he is good . His loving kindness is everlasting .
Give thanks to the God of gods . His loving kindness is everlasting .
Give thanks to the Lord of lords . His loving kindness is everlasting .

And brought Israel out from their midst , for his loving kindness is everlasting .
With a strong hand and an outstretched arm , for his loving kindness is everlasting .

And made Israel pass through the midst of it . For his loving kindness is everlasting .
But he overthrew Pharaoh and his army in the Red Sea , for his loving kindness is everlasting .
To him who led his people through the wilderness , for his loving kindness is everlasting .
To him who destroyed great kings . His loving kindness is everlasting .
And struck mighty kings , for his loving kindness is everlasting :
Sihon , king of the Amorites , for his loving kindness is everlasting ,
And Og , king of Bashan , for his loving kindness is everlasting ,
And gave their land as a heritage , for his loving kindness is everlasting ,
Even a heritage to Israel his servant , for his loving kindness is everlasting .
He remembered us in our low estate . His loving kindness is everlasting .
He has rescued us from our adversaries , for his loving kindness is everlasting .
He gives food to all flesh , for his loving kindness is everlasting .
Give thanks to the God of heaven , for his loving kindness is everlasting .
By the rivers of Babylon , we sat down and cried as we remembered Zion .
In the midst of it we hung our harps on poplar trees .
It was there that those who had captured us demanded that we sing . Those who guarded us wanted us to entertain them . They said : » Sing a song from Zion for us ! «
How could we sing Jehovah’s song in a foreign land ?
If I forget you , Jerusalem , let my right hand forget how to play the harp .
Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I do not remember you , if I do not consider Jerusalem my highest joy .
O Jehovah , remember the people of Edom . Remember what they did the day Jerusalem was captured . They said : » Tear it down ! Tear it down to its foundation . «
You destructive people of Babylon , blessed is the one who pays you back with the same treatment you gave us .
Blessed is the one who grabs your little children and smashes them against a rock .
I will adore you with all my heart . I will make music to praise you in front of the false gods .
I will bow toward your holy temple . I will praise your name because of your loving kindness and truth . You have made your name and your covenant greater than everything .
When I called , you answered me . You made me bold . You strengthened me .
All the kings of the earth will praise you , O Jehovah , because they have heard the words you spoke .
They will sing this about the ways of Jehovah : Jehovah’s honor is great !
Even though Jehovah is high above , he sees humble people close up , and he recognizes arrogant people from a distance .
Even though I walk into the middle of trouble , you guard my life against the anger of my enemies . You stretch out your hand , and your right hand saves me .
Jehovah will do everything for me . O Jehovah , your mercy endures forever . Do not let go of what your hands have made .
O Jehovah , you have searched me and you know me .
You know when I sit down and when I rise up . You understand my thought from afar .
You inspect my path and my lying down . You are intimately acquainted with my ways .
Even before I speak words from my tongue , behold , O Jehovah , You know it all .
You have enclosed me behind and before , and laid your hand upon me .
Knowing this is too wonderful for me ! It is too high , I cannot attain to it .
Where can I go from your Spirit ? Or where can I flee from your presence ?
If I ascend to heaven , you are there . If I make my bed in the grave , behold , you are there .
If I take the wings of the dawn , if I dwell in the remotest part of the sea ,
Even there your hand will lead me . Your right hand will lay hold of me .
If I say : » Certainly the darkness will overwhelm me ! « Then the light around me will be night .
Even the darkness is not dark to you . And the night is as bright as the day . Darkness and light are alike to you .
For you formed my inward parts . You wove me in my mother's womb .
I will praise you , for in an awesome way I am wonderfully made . Your works are wonderful and I know this very well .
My frame was not hidden from you , when I was made in secret , and woven in the depths of the earth .
Your eyes saw my embryo and all were written in your book ; the days ordained for me . Even this before one had taken place .
How precious are your thoughts to me , O God ! How numerous is the sum of them !
If I should count them , they would outnumber the sand . When I awake , I am still with you .
If you would destroy the wicked , O God , depart from me , therefore , men of bloodshed .
For they speak against you wickedly . Your enemies take your name in vain .
Do I not hate those who hate You , O Jehovah ? And do I not loathe those who rise up against you ?
I hate them with the utmost hatred ! They have become my enemies .
Examine me , O God , and know my heart . Test me and know my anxious troubled painful disturbing thoughts .
See if there is any hurtful way in me , and lead me in the everlasting way .
Rescue me from evil people , O Jehovah . Keep me safe from violent people .

They plan evil things in their hearts . They start conflicts fights wars every day .
They make their tongues as sharp as a snake's fang . Their lips hide the venom of poisonous snakes .
Protect me from the hands of wicked people , O Jehovah . Keep me safe from violent people . They try to trip me .
Arrogant people have laid a trap for me . They have spread out a net with ropes . They have set traps for me along the road .
I said to Jehovah : You are my God . O Jehovah , open your ears to hear my plea for pity .
O Lord Jehovah Almighty , the strong one who saves me , you have covered my head in the day of battle .
O Jehovah , do not give wicked people what they want . Do not let their evil plans succeed , or they will become arrogant .
Let the heads of those who surround me be covered with their own threats .
Let burning coals fall on them . Let them be thrown into a pit , never to rise again .
Do not let slanderers prosper on earth . Let evil hunt down violent people with one blow after another .
I know that Jehovah will defend the rights of those who are oppressed and the cause of those who are needy .
Indeed , righteous people will give thanks praise reverence worship to your name . Upright people will live in your presence .
O Jehovah I cry out to you : Come quickly . Give ear to my voice Listen to me when I cry out to you .
Let my prayer be accepted as sweet-smelling incense in your presence . Let the lifting up of my hands in prayer be accepted as an evening sacrifice .
O Jehovah , set a guard at my mouth . Keep watch over the door of my lips .
Do not let me be persuaded to do anything evil or to become involved with wickedness , with people who are troublemakers . Do not let me taste their delicacies .
A righteous person may strike me or correct me out of kindness . It is like lotion for my head . My head will not refuse it , because my prayer is directed against evil deeds .
When their judges are thrown off a cliff , they will listen to what I have to say . It will sound pleasant to them .
As someone plows and breaks up the ground , so our bones will be planted at the mouth of the grave .
My eyes look to you , O Jehovah . I have taken refuge in you . Do not leave me defenseless .
Keep me away from the trap they set for me and from the traps set by troublemakers .
Let wicked people fall into their own nets , while I escape unharmed .
I cry loudly to Jehovah . Loudly , I plead with Jehovah for mercy .

I pour out my complaints in his presence and tell him my troubles .
When I begin to lose hope , you already know what I am experiencing . My enemies have hidden a trap for me on the path where I walk .
Look to my right and see that no one notices me . Escape is impossible for me . No one cares about me .
I call out to you , O Jehovah . I say : » You are my refuge , my own inheritance in this world of the living . «
Pay attention to my cry for help ! I am very weak . Rescue me from those who pursue me because they are too strong for me .
Release me from prison so that I may praise your name . Righteous people will surround me because you are good to me .
Hear my prayer , O Jehovah , Give ear to my supplications ! Answer me in your faithfulness . Answer me in your righteousness !
Do not enter into judgment with your servant , for in your sight no man living is righteous .
For the enemy has persecuted me . He has crushed my life to the ground . He has made me dwell in dark places , like those who have long been dead .
Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me . My heart is devastated within me .
I remember the days of old . I meditate think deeply intensely study on all your activities . I muse on the work of your hands .
I stretch out my hands to you for I long for you , like a parched land .
Answer me quickly , O Jehovah for my spirit fails . Do not hide your face from me or I will become like those who go down to the pit .
Let me hear your loving kindness in the morning . For I trust in you ! Teach me the way in which I should walk for to you I am lifted up .
Deliver me , O Jehovah , from my enemies . I take refuge in you .
Teach me to do your will , for you are my God . Let your good Spirit lead me on level ground .
For the sake of your name , O Jehovah , revive me . In your righteousness bring me out of trouble .
In your loving kindness , cut off my enemies and destroy all those who afflict me . For I am your servant .
David : Blessed be my rock strength Jehovah . He trained my hands to fight and my fingers to do battle ,
My loving kindness , and my fortress ; my high tower , and my deliverer ; and my shield in whom I trust ; who subdues my people under me .
Jehovah , what is man , that you notice him or the son of man , that you regard him !
Man is like a mere breath . His days are like a passing shadow .
Bow down your heavens , O Jehovah , and come down . Touch the mountains that they may smoke .
Flash lightning and scatter them . Send out your arrows and confuse them .
Stretch forth your hand from on high . Rescue me and deliver me out of great waters , out of the hand of aliens
Whose mouths speak deceit , whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood .
I will sing a new song to you , O God ; upon a harp of ten strings I will sing praises to you .
You give salvation to kings . You rescue David your servant from the evil sword .
Rescue me and deliver me out of the hand of aliens . Their mouths speak deceit . Their right hand is a right hand of falsehood .
Let our sons in their youth be as grown-up plants , and our daughters as corner pillars fashioned as for a palace .
Let our garners be full , furnishing every kind of produce , our flocks bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields ;
Let our cattle bear without mishap and without loss . Let there be no outcry in our streets !
How blessed are the people who are so situated . How blessed are the people whose God is Jehovah !
I will praise you , my God and King ! I will consecrate your name forever and ever .
Every day I will bless you . I will praise your name forever and ever .
Great is Jehovah , and highly to be praised . His greatness is unsearchable beyond human calculation .
One generation shall praise your works to another . They will declare your mighty acts .
On the glorious splendor of your majesty and on your wonderful works , I will meditate .
Men shall speak of the power of your awesome acts , and I will tell of your greatness .
They will eagerly utter the memory of your great goodness and will shout joyfully of your righteousness .
Jehovah is gracious and merciful ; Slow to anger and great in loving-kindness .
Jehovah is good to all and his mercies are over all his works .

The proverbs of Solomon son of David , king of Israel :
To know wisdom and instruction . To discern and understand words .
To receive instruction with wisdom , justice , judgment and integrity .
To give wisdom and refinement to the simple . To the young man knowledge and discretion .
A wise man will hear and will increase learning . A man of understanding will procure wise counsel .
This will help him understand a proverb and the interpretation as well as the words of the wise and their riddles .
Respect for Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge truth understanding wisdom . Fools despise wisdom and instruction .
My son , listen to the instruction of your father . Do not forsake the law of your mother .
Discipline and education are a graceful ornament on your head , and a golden chain around your neck .
My son , if sinners tempt you do not consent .
If they say : » Come with us . Let us lie in wait to kill someone . Let us ambush the innocent without cause .
» Let us swallow them alive and whole just as the grave does , and just as the dead go into the pit .
» We will find precious material possessions and we fill our houses with plunder .
» Throw in with us . Let us all have one purse . «
My son , do not walk in the way with them . Withhold your food from their path !
For their feet run to evil . They hurry to shed blood .
Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird .
They lie in wait for their own blood murder . They set an ambush for their own lives .
So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for unjust dishonest gain . Greed takes away the life of its owner .
Wisdom calls you ! She raises her voice in the streets and marketplaces .
She calls in the streets , in the opening of the gates : in the city she utters her words . She says :
» How long , you simple stupid foolish ones , will you love simplicity foolishness stupidity ? The scoffers delight in scoffing . Fools hate knowledge !
» Listen when I reprove you . I will pour out my spirit on you . I will make my words known to you .
» I called you ! I stretched out my hand to you . You paid no attention to me .
» You have ignored all my counsel . You accept no correction .
» I also will laugh at your trouble . I will mock when your fear comes .
» Trouble and distress will surround you like a whirlwind , like a great storm .
» You will ask for my help , but I will not listen . You will search , but you will not find me .
» You have no use for knowledge and you refuse to respect Jehovah .
» You rejected my advice and paid no attention when I warned you .
» Now you will get what you deserve for what you have done . Your own advice will make you sick .
» Sin and self-satisfaction bring destruction and death to stupid fools .
» Whoever listens to me will be secure and will be free from the fear of evil . «
My son , take my words to heart and treasure my commandments within you .
Pay close attention to wisdom , and let your mind and heart inner being reach for discernment .
Call out for insight . Lift up your voice for understanding .
Search for wisdom as if it were silver . Hunt for it as if it were hidden treasure !
If you do these things you will have respect for Jehovah and you will find the true knowledge of God !
Jehovah gives wisdom . From his mouth come knowledge and understanding .
He stores up insightful sound substantial wisdom for the upright . He is a shield for those who walk in integrity .
He guards those on paths of justice . He watches over the way of his godly ones .
You will understand righteousness and justice . You will have equity and every good course in life .
Wisdom enters your heart . Knowledge gives you pleasure .
Discretion will protect you . Understanding will watch over you .
It will deliver you from the way of evil , from the man who speaks perverse things .
Who leave the paths of uprightness , to walk in the ways of darkness ?
Who rejoice in doing evil ? They delight in the perversity of the wicked .
The wicked are crooked . They are devious in their ways .
You will be able to resist any immoral woman who tries to seduce you with her smooth talk .
She is unfaithful to her own husband and forgets her sacred vows to God .
If you go to her house , you are traveling the road to death . To go there is to approach the dead .
No one who visits her ever comes back . He cannot return to the road to life .
You must follow the example of good people and live a righteous life .
The upright will live in the land . The blameless people of integrity will remain .
The wicked will be cut off from the land . The unfaithful will be uprooted .
My son , do not forget my law . Let your heart obey my commandments .
My precepts will give you a long , peaceful , and prosperous life .
Do not let kindness and truth leave you . Bind them around your neck . Write them on the tablet of your heart .
You will find kindness and understanding in the sight of God and man .
Trust in Jehovah with all your heart . Do not lean on your own understanding .
In all your ways acknowledge recognize Him and He will make your paths straight .
Do not think you are wise enough . Respect Jehovah and turn away from evil .
This will make you healthy , and you will feel strong .
Honor Jehovah with your wealth and give him the best of all you have .
Your barns will be filled with plenty . Your vats will overflow with new wine .
My son , do not despise Jehovah’s discipline or be weary of his correction .
For whom Jehovah loves He reproves , just like a father corrects the son he loves dearly .
How blessed is the man who finds wisdom . Happy is the man who gains understanding .
The profit from wisdom is better than the profit from silver . Her gain is better than fine gold .
She wisdom is more precious than pearls . Nothing you desire compares with wisdom .
Long life is in her right hand . In her left hand are riches and honor .
Her ways are pleasant ways . All her paths are peace .
She wisdom is a tree of life to those who hold her . Happy are all who keep her .
In wisdom Jehovah founded the earth . In understanding he established the heavens .
By his knowledge the depths are broken up and the clouds drop down the dew .
My son , do not let them depart from your eyes . Keep sound wisdom and discretion !
They will mean life to you and adornment to your neck .
You will walk in your way safely . Your foot will not stumble .
When you lie down you will not be afraid . Yes , you will lie down and your sleep will be sweet .
Do not be afraid of sudden fear or trouble from the wicked when it comes .
Jehovah will be your confidence . He will keep your foot from stumbling .
Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due when it is in the power of your hand to do it .
If you can help them now , never tell your neighbors : » Wait until tomorrow . «
Do not plan anything that will hurt your neighbors . They live beside you , trusting you .
Argue with no one if they have never done you any harm .
Do not be jealous of violent people or decide to act as they do .
Jehovah hates people who do evil . He takes righteous people into his confidence .
Jehovah puts a curse on the homes of the wicked , but blesses the homes of the just .
He has no use for conceited people . He shows loving kindness to the humble .
Wise people will inherit glory . But disgrace is the legacy of stupid foolish people .
Listen my sons to what your father teaches you . Pay attention and gain understanding .
I give you good instruction . Do not abandon my Law !
I was my father’s son , tender and the only son to my mother .
Father taught me . He said : » Remember my words in your heart . Obey my commandments and live .
» Achieve wisdom and understanding ! Do not forget or ignore what I say .
» Do not abandon wisdom , and she will protect you . Love her , and she will keep you safe .
» Wisdom is the most important thing . So gain wisdom ! And by all means arrive at understanding .
» Love wisdom and she will exalt you . Embrace wisdom and she will honor you .
» She will present you with a crown of glory . «
Listen to me , my son . Accept what I tell you and live a long life .
I taught you wisdom and the right way to live .
Walk with wisdom and nothing will stand in your way . Run with wisdom and you will not stumble .
Take firm hold of instruction and do not let go . Obey her for she is your life .
Do not enter the path of the wicked . Do not walk in the way of evil men .
Avoid it ! Do not pass by it . Turn away from it , and pass on !
They do not sleep unless they have done evil . Their sleep is taken away unless they make someone fall .
They eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence .
The path of the righteous is like the shining light of dawn that shines brighter and brighter until the more perfect day .
The way of the wicked is like darkness . They do not know what makes them stumble .
My son , pay attention to my words . Incline your ear extend your hearing to my sayings .
Do not let them leave your sight . Hold them in the midst of your heart !
For they are life to those who find them , and health to all their flesh .
Guard your heart with all diligence for out of it come the source of life .
Put away from you a deceitful mouth . Get rid of devious speech .
Let your eyes look straight ahead . Let you own eyes gaze be fixed straight in front of you .
Ponder the path of your feet . Let all your ways be established firm .
Do not turn to the right or to the left . Remove your foot from evil .
My son , pay attention to my wisdom . Listen to my understanding .
That way you will maintain discretion and your lips will keep knowledge .
The lips of an immoral woman drip as a honeycomb . Her mouth is smoother than oil .
But in the end she is bitter as wormwood , sharp as a two edged sword .
Her feet go down to death . Her steps take hold of the grave .
She does not ponder the path of life . Her unstable ways she does not know .
Hear me now my son . Do not depart from the words of my mouth .
Keep far away from her . Do not go near the door of her house .
You will give your honor majesty to others and your years to the cruel one .
Strangers will be filled with your financial strength . Strangers will benefit from your hard work .
You mourn at last , when your flesh and your body are consumed .
You say : » How I have hated instruction ! My heart despised reproof .
» I did not obey the voice of my teachers . I did not listen to my instructors !
» I was very near total ruin in the midst of the congregation . «
Drink water from your own cistern . Drink running water from your own well .
Should your waters overflow in the streets , like streams of water in public places ?
Let them be yours alone . Do not share with strangers .
Let your fountain be blessed . Rejoice with the wife of your youth .
She is like a loving deer and a graceful doe . Let her breasts satisfy you at all times . Always be delighted with her love .
Why will you be intimate with an immoral woman , and embrace the bosom of a stranger ?
The ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah . He ponders all his paths .
His own iniquities will catch the wicked . He will be held with the cords of his sins .
He dies without instruction . He goes astray because of his foolishness .
My son , if you serve as surety for your friend and you give your pledge to him ,
You are snared with the words of your mouth . You are captured by the words of your mouth !
You are now in the power of that person . Here is what you should do : Go and beg for permission to call off the agreement .
Do this before you fall asleep . Do not allow your eyes to close .
Deliver your self like a deer from the hand of the hunter , and like a bird from the hand of the fowler bird catcher .
Go to the ant , you lazy person . Consider her ways and be wise !
The lowly ant has no guide or overseer .
It prepares its food in the summer and gathers food at the harvest .
How long will you sleep , O lazy person ? When will you arise from your sleep ?
» A little sleep , a little slumber , a little folding of the hands to rest .
Your poverty comes like a traveler . Your need comes like an armed man .
An ungodly person , a wicked man , walks with a perverse mouth .
He winks with his eyes , he speaks with his feet , he teaches with his fingers .
Fraud is in his heart , he devises mischief continually ; he sows discord .
His disaster will come suddenly . Suddenly he is broken beyond repair .
Jehovah hates these six things : Yes , seven are an abomination to him :
A proud look , a lying tongue , and hands that shed innocent blood ,
A heart that devises wicked schemes , feet that run quickly to badness ,
A false witness that speaks lies , and he that sows discord among brothers .
My son , obey your father's command , and do not abandon the law of your mother :
Constantly bind them upon your heart , and tie them about your neck .
When you go , they will lead you ; when you sleep they will watch over you and when you awake , they will talk to you .
For the commandment is a lamp . The law is light . Reproofs for instruction are the way of life .
This will keep you from the evil woman and from the smooth tongue of an adulterous woman .
Do not lust after her beauty in your heart . Do not let her attract you with her eyelids .
A prostitute will cost you your last crust of bread . An adulteress will cost you your life .
Can a man have fire in his lap and his clothes not be burned ?
Can one walk on hot coals , and his feet not be burned ?
He who has sex with another mans wife ; anyone who embraces her will not be innocent .
Men do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his hunger when he is starving .
But if he is caught , he must repay sevenfold . He must give everything in his house .
He who commits adultery with a woman lacks judgment and destroys himself .
He will get wounds and be dishonored . His shame will not be wiped away .
Jealousy enrages a man . He will not be spared in the day of vengeance .
He will not regard any ransom , nor will he be content when you give many gifts .
My son , pay attention to my words , and preserve my commandments within you .
Obey my commandments and live , and my teaching like the pupil of your eye .
Bind them upon your fingers . Write them upon the table of your heart .
Say to wisdom : » You are my sister ! « Call understanding your friend .
That they may keep you from the adulteress , from the stranger with seductive words .
I looked out the window of my house .
I saw among the simple ones , I discerned among the youth , a young man without understanding .
He passed through the street near her corner . He went to her house .
In the twilight , in the evening , in the darkness of the night :
He met an evil hearted woman dressed seductively like an immoral woman .
She is loud and rebellious and never stays at home .
Now in the streets and squares , she waits at every corner .
She put her arms around him and kissed him , and with an impudent look she said :
» I have peace offerings with me since I paid my vows .
» So I came to meet you and seek your presence . I found you .
» I covered my bed with fine linen from Egypt .
» I perfumed my bed with myrrh , aloes , and cinnamon .
» Come ; let us take our fill of love until morning . Let us comfort ourselves with love .
» My husband is not at home . He went on a long trip .
» He took a bag of money with him . He will come home at the appointed day . «
She seduced him with her persuasive words . She forced him with her flattering lips .
He immediately goes after her . He is like a bull that goes to the slaughter . Or as a fool to the correction of the stocks ,
Till a dart strikes through his liver . The bird hurries to the snare without knowing it would cost his life .
Listen to me dear sons and pay attention to the words of my mouth .
Do not let your heart go after her ways . Do not stray in her paths .
She has wounded many . Many strong men have been slain by her .
Her house is the way to the grave , going down to the chambers of death .
Does wisdom cry out ? Does understanding direct her voice ?
She takes her stand on top of high places and in the street intersections .
She cries out at the gates , at the entrance by the doors :
» I call to you men . My voice is to the sons of man .
» O you simple ones , understand wisdom and , you fools , be of an understanding heart .
» Listen for I speak of excellent things . The truth comes from my lips .
» My mouth will speak truth ! Wickedness is an abomination to my lips .
» All my speech is righteous . Nothing crooked or perverse comes from my mouth .
» They are all straight talk to him who understands . It is proper to those who find knowledge .
» Receive my instruction and not silver . Take knowledge rather than choice gold .
» For wisdom is better than pearls . Nothing desirable compares to it .
» Wisdom dwells with discretion and it finds knowledge and sound judgment .
» Respect for Jehovah means to hate evil . I hate : pride , and arrogance , the evil way , and the perverse mouth .
» Counsel is mine , and sound wisdom : I understand and I am very strong .
» Kings reign by me , and princes decree justice .
» By me princes rule , and nobles , even all the judges of the earth .
» I love those who love me . Those who earnestly seek me will find me .
» Riches and honor are with me . Yes , durable riches and righteousness .
» My fruit is better than gold , yes , better than fine gold . My yield is better than choice silver .
» I lead in the way of righteousness , in the midst of the paths of judgment :
» I may cause those who love me to inherit wealth . I will fill their treasuries .
» Jehovah created me in the beginning of his way , before his works of antiquity .
» I was made from long ago , before the earth began .
» When there were no depths or fountains abounding with water , I was brought forth .
» Before the mountains were settled , before the hills I was brought forth :
» He had not made the earth or the fields or the highest part of the dust of the world .
» When he prepared the heavens , I was there . When he circled the face of the deep :
» When he established the clouds above , when he strengthened the fountains of the deep ,
» When he gave to the sea his decree , that the waters should not pass his command , when he appointed the foundations of the earth ,
» Then I was beside him , as a master workman with him : and I was daily his delight , rejoicing always before him .
» I rejoiced in the inhabited earth . My delights were with the sons of men .
» Listen to me , my children : for blessed are those who practice my ways .
» Hear instruction , do not refuse it and be wise .
» Blessed is the man who listens to me . He watches daily at my gates , waiting at my doorposts .
» Those who find me find life . They will receive favor from Jehovah .
» But he who sins against me wrongs himself . All who hate me love death . «
Wisdom built her house . She carved her seven pillars .
She prepared her food and mixed her wine . She furnished her table .
She sent her maidens . She cried on the highest places of the city ,
» Who is simple ? Let him turn in here ! He who lacks understanding , « she says to him ,
» Come eat my bread , and drink the wine that I have mixed .
» Forsake the foolish , and live . Travel in the way of understanding . «
Correct a scoffer and get dishonor for yourself . Rebuke a wicked man and receive insults .
Correct a scoffer mocker scorner and he will hate you . Reprove a wise man and he will love you .
Give instruction to a wise man and he will become even wiser . Teach a righteous man , and he will increase his learning insight .
Respect for Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom . Knowledge of the holy One is understanding discernment truth wisdom .
I will increase your days . I will add more years to your life .
When you are wise you are wise for yourself . When you scoff you bear it alone .
A foolish woman is noisy . She has no sense at all .
She sits at the door of her house , on a seat in the high places of the city ,
to call those who pass by who go straight on their way :
» Let the inexperienced naïve one come in here , « and to the person who lacks understanding she says :
» Stolen waters are sweet , and bread eaten in secret is pleasant . «
He does not know the dead are there . Her guests are in the depths of the grave .
A wise son makes a father glad : but a foolish son is sorrow depression grief for his mother .
Treasures of wickedness the morally wrong profit nothing , but righteousness delivers from death .
Jehovah will not allow the righteous to hunger . He rejects the mischief of the wicked .
He becomes poor who deals with a lazy hand . The hand of the diligent makes rich .
He who gathers in summer is a wise son . He who sleeps at the harvest is a son who causes shame .
Blessings cover the head of the righteous . Violence covers the mouth of the wicked .
The memory of the righteous is blessed . The name of the wicked will waste away .
The wise in heart will accept the law but a babbling fool will fall .
He who walks with integrity walks safely . He who perverts his ways will be found out .
He who winks the eye in a jesture of malice causes trouble . A babbling fool will fall .
The mouth of a righteous man is a fountain of life . Aggression comes from the mouth of the wicked .
Hatred stirs up strife . Love covers all sins .
Wisdom is found on the lips of the understanding discerning . A rod is for the back of him who lacks understanding .
Wise men preserve knowledge . The mouth of the foolish is near destruction .
The rich man's wealth is his strength . The destruction of the poor is their poverty .
The labor of the righteous leads to life . The yield of the wicked is punishment .
He who regards instruction is in the way of life . He who refuses reproof goes mentally and morally astray .
Truly a fool hides hatred with lying lips , and speaks slander .
Sin does not hide from a multitude of words . The wise controls his lips .
The tongue of the righteous is like choice silver . The heart of the wicked has little worth .
The lips of the righteous feed many . Fools die for lack of understanding .
The blessing of Jehovah makes rich and he adds no grief to it .
It is like sport to a fool to do mischief . A man of understanding has wisdom .
The fear of the wicked will come upon him . The desire of the righteous will be granted .
The whirlwind passes and the wicked is no more . The righteous has an everlasting foundation .
As vinegar to the teeth , and as smoke to the eyes , so is the lazy man to those who sent him .
Respect for Jehovah prolongs life . The years of the wicked will be shortened .
The hope of the righteous is joy . The prospect for the wicked is bleak .
The way of Jehovah is a rock stronghold to the upright . The workers of iniquity will be destroyed .
The righteous will never be removed . The wicked will not inhabit the earth .
The mouth of the righteous flows with wisdom but the perverted tongue will be destroyed .
The lips of the righteous speak what is acceptable . The mouth of the wicked speaks perversion .
A false scale balance is an abomination to Jehovah . A perfect weight is his delight .
Pride comes and then comes shame . Wisdom is with the humble .
The integrity of the upright will guide them . The perverseness of transgressors will destroy them .
Riches do not profit in the day of wrath . Righteousness delivers from death .
Righteousness of the undefiled man of integrity directs his way ! Wickedness causes the evil to fall .
Righteousness will deliver the upright . Greed will capture the unfaithful .
When a wicked man dies his expectation perishes , indeed the hope of unjust men perishes .
The righteous is delivered from trouble . The wicked goes in his place .
A godless hypocrite destroys his neighbor with his mouth . The righteous will be delivered through knowledge .
The city rejoices when all goes well with the righteous . There is joyful shouting when the wicked perish .
The city is exalted by the blessing of the upright . The mouth of the wicked ruins the city .
He who is void of wisdom despises his neighbor , but a man of understanding holds his peace .
A talebearer reveals secrets . He that is of a faithful spirit conceals the matter .
The people fall where there is no counsel . Yes , the people fall but in the multitude of counselors there is safety .
He that is surety for a stranger will suffer . He that hates being surety is sure .
A gracious woman retains honor . Ruthless and violent men retain riches .
The merciful man does himself good . The cruel man troubles his own flesh .
The wicked works a deceitful work . There is a sure reward for the one who sows righteousness .
Righteousness leads to life and he that pursues evil participates in his own death .
Those who are of a perverse heart are abomination to Jehovah . The way of the upright is his delight .
Hand in hand united , the wicked shall not be unpunished ; but the descendants of the righteous will be delivered .
A beautiful woman who lacks discretion is like a jewel of gold in a swine's snout .
The desire of the righteous is only good : but the expectation of the wicked is intense anger .
There is one who scatters , and yet increases . There is one who withholds what is due and it leads to poverty .
The liberal person will prosper . He who waters will be watered .
He who withholds corn from the people will be cursed . Blessing will be on the head of him that sells it .
He who diligently seeks good procures favor . He who seeks evil , evil will come to him .
He who trusts in his riches will fall . The righteous will flourish as a leaf on a branch .
He who troubles his own house will inherit the wind . The fool will serve the wise of heart .
The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life . He who gains life is wise .
The righteous will be rewarded on the earth much more than the wicked and the sinner .
Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge . He that hates reproof is stupid .
A good man obtains favor from Jehovah . He will condemn a man of wicked intentions .
A man will not stand firm on sin . The root of the righteous will not be moved .
A virtuous wife is a crown to her husband . She who acts shameful is rottenness in his bones .
The thoughts of the righteous are just . The counsels of the wicked are deceitful .
The words of the wicked lie in wait for blood , but the mouth of the upright delivers them .
The wicked are overthrown and are no more . The house of the righteous will stand .
A man is commended according to his wisdom . He with a perverse heart will be despised .
He with a servant who is lightly esteemed is better off than he who has no food and yet is honored .
A righteous man has regard for the life of his animal , but the compassion of the wicked is terrible .
He who tills his land will have plenty of bread . He who follows worthless people lacks sense .
The wicked desires the booty of evil men , but the root of the righteous yields fruit .
The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips . The righteous will depart from trouble .
A man will be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth . The deeds of a man's hands will return to him .
The way of a fool is right in his own eyes . He who listens to counsel is wise .
A fool's anger is instantly known . A prudent man conceals shame .
He who speaks truth shows righteousness , but a false witness deceit .
There is one who speaks rashly like the piercing of a sword . The tongue of the wise brings a cure .
The lip of truth will be established forever . A lying tongue is only for a moment .
Deceit is in the heart of those who contrive evil , but the counselors of peace have joy .
No evil will happen to the righteous . The wicked will be filled with trouble .
Lying lips are an abomination to Jehovah . Those who deal truly are his delight .
A prudent man conceals knowledge . The heart of fools proclaims foolishness .
The hand of the diligent will bear rule . The lazy will be under forced labor .
Anxiety in the heart of man make it heavy , but a good word makes it glad .
The righteous is a guide to his neighbor . The way of the wicked leads others astray .

See a man wise in his own conceit ? » There is more hope for a fool than for him . «
The lazy man says : » There is a lion in the way ; a lion is in the streets . «
As the door turns on its hinges , so does the lazy man on his bed .
The lazy man hides his hand in his bosom . It wearies him to lift it to his mouth .
The lazy man is wiser in his own conceit than seven men who can answer with good sense .
He who meddles in someone else’s quarrel is like one who takes a dog by the ears .
This is like a mad man who throws firebrands , arrows , and death .
So is the man who deceives his neighbor , and says : » I was only joking . «
Without wood the fire goes out . Without a talebearer strife ceases .
As coals are to burning coals , and wood to fire ; so is a contentious man to kindle disputes .
The words of a talebearer are as wounds , and they go down into the innermost parts .
Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a broken pottery covered with silver dross .
He who hates disguises with his lips , and stores deceit within him .
When he speaks kind words do not believe him . There are seven abominations in his heart .
When hatred is covered by deceit , wickedness is revealed to the entire congregation .
He who digs a pit will fall in it . He who rolls a stone will have it roll back on him .
A lying tongue hates those afflicted by it and a flattering mouth works ruin .
Do not brag about tomorrow for you do not know what a day may bring .
Let another man praise you and not your own mouth , a stranger , and not your own lips .
A stone is heavy , and the sand weighty ; but a fool's anger is heavier than them both .
Wrath is cruel , and anger is outrageous ; but who is able to stand before envy ?
Open rebuke is better than secret love .
Faithful are the wounds of a friend , but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful .
The full person dislikes the honeycomb , but to the hungry every bitter thing is sweet .
As a bird that wanders from her nest , so is a man who wanders from his place .
As oil and perfume delight the heart so the sweetness of a man's friend delights his heart .
Do not forget your friends or your father's friends . If you are in trouble , do not ask a relative for help . A nearby neighbor can help you more than relatives who are far away .
Be wise , my son , and make my heart happy and I will have an answer for anyone who criticizes taunts torments me .
A prudent man anticipates evil and hides ; but the simple pass on , and are punished .
Take his garment that is surety for a stranger , and take him as pledge as surety for a fornicator .
He that blesses his friend with a loud voice , rising early in the morning , it shall be counted a curse to him .
Continual dripping on a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike .
Trying to stop her is like trying to stop the wind , or holding something with greased hands .
Just as iron sharpens iron so one man sharpens another .
When you keep a fig tree you eat the fruit . He who waits on his master will be honored .
As in water face reflects face , the heart of man is reveals the man .
The grave and destruction are never full ; so the eyes of man are never satisfied .
The refining pot is for silver . The furnace is for gold . A man is valued by what others say about him .
Though you grind a fool in mortar his foolishness will not depart from him .
Be diligent to know the state of your flocks and attend to your herds .
Riches are not forever : and a crown does not endure for every generation .
The hay appears and the tender grass shows itself . Herbs of the mountains are gathered .
The lambs are for your clothing , and the goats bring the price of the field .
You will have enough goats' milk for your food , for the food of your household , and for the maintenance for your maidservants .
The wicked run when no man pursues , but the righteous are bold as a lion .
There are many princes after the transgression of a land . But a man of understanding and knowledge remains for a long time .
A poor man that oppresses the poor is like a sweeping rain that leaves no food .
They who forsake the law praise the wicked . Those who obey the law oppose them .
Evil men do not understand justice . Those who seek Jehovah understand all things .
Better is the poor man who walks in uprightness , than the rich man who is perverse in his ways .
He who obeys the law is a wise son . But he who is a companion of worthless men shames his father .
He who becomes wealthy through unfair loans and interest collects them for the one who pitys the poor .
The prayer of the person who will not listen to the law is disgusting .
Whoever leads decent people into evil will fall into his own pit . Innocent people will inherit good things .
A rich person is wise in his own eyes , but the poor who has understanding , sees right through him .
When righteous people rejoice , there is great glory , but when wicked people rise , people hide themselves .
The man who covers his sins will not be blessed ; but whoever confesses and leaves them will have mercy .
Blessed is the man reverencing God . He who hardens his heart will fall into trouble .
Like a roaring lion and a charging bear , so is a wicked ruler over the helpless people .
The ruler who lacks understanding is a great oppressor . He who hates covetousness will prolong his days .
A violent and bloodthirsty man will run to the pit ; let no man help him .
Whoever walks blamelessly will be saved : but he who is perverse in his ways will fall at once .
He who tills his land will have plenty of bread . He who follows after vain persons will have poverty .
A faithful man will have many blessings . But he who hurries to be rich will not go unpunished .
It is not good to show partiality for a man will transgress for a piece of bread .
He who hurries to be rich has an evil eye . He does not think poverty will come to him .
He who reproves a man later find more favor than he who flatters with the tongue .
Whoever robs his father or mother , and says : » It is no transgression ; « the same is the companion of a man who destroys .
The person with a proud heart stirs up discord . The person who trusts Jehovah will prosper .
He who trusts in his own heart is a fool . He who walks wisely will be delivered .
He who gives to the poor will not lack . But he who hides his eyes will have many curses .
When the wicked rise people hide , but when they die , the righteous increase .
He who is often reprimanded and hardens his neck will suddenly be destroyed , and that without remedy .
When the righteous increase the people rejoice . When the wicked rule the people mourn .
He who loves wisdom makes his father rejoice . But he who keeps company with fornicators wastes his wealth .
The king establishes the land by justice . He who receives gifts overthrows it .
A man who flatters his neighbor spreads a net for his feet .
In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare . But the righteous sings and rejoices .
The righteous considers the cause of the poor . The wicked do not get to know it .
Scornful men bring a city into a snare . Wise men turn away anger .
If a wise man disputes with a foolish man , whether the fool rages or laughs , there is no rest .
The bloodthirsty hate the upright . The righteous are concerned for his life .
A fool loses his temper . But a wise man holds it back .
If a ruler listens to lies , all his servants are wicked .
The poor and the deceitful have this in common : Jehovah lightens their eyes .
The king who faithfully judges the poor will have his throne established forever .
The rod and reproof give wisdom : but a child left to himself brings shame to his mother .
When the wicked are multiplied , transgression increases . But the righteous will see their fall .
Correct your son , and he will give you rest . Yes , he will give you delight .
Where there is no vision the people perish . The one who obeys the law is happy .
A servant will not be corrected by words alone . Even though he understands he will not respond .
See a man quick to talk ? There is more hope for a fool then for him .
The man who carefully brings up pays close attention to nourishes his servant from childhood will in the future have him become like his son .
An angry man stirs up dissension . A furious man abounds in sin .
A man's pride will bring him low . The humble in spirit retain honor .
The partner of a thief hates his life . He hears the oath but tells nothing .
Fear of man brings a snare trap . He who trusts in Jehovah will be safe .
Many seek favor from the ruler ; but every man's judgment comes from Jehovah .
An unjust man is an abomination disgusting to the righteous . He who is upright in the way is an abomination detestable to the wicked .
The words of Agur the son of Jakeh , the prophecy he spoke to Ithiel and Ucal :
Surely I am more stupid then any man , and do not have the understanding of a man .
I neither learned wisdom , nor have the knowledge of the holy .
Who ascended up into heaven , or descended ? Who gathered the wind in his hands ? Who bound the waters in a garment ? Who established all the ends of the earth ? What is his name , and what is his son's name , if you can tell me ?
Every word of God is pure . He is a shield to those who trust him .
Do not add to his words of he will reprove you . You will be found to be a liar .
I require two things from you . Do not deprive me of them before I die .
Remove far from me vanity and lies . Give me neither poverty nor riches . Feed me with food necessary for me .
If I am full I could deny you and say , » Who is Jehovah ? « Or if I am poor and steal , I could take God’s name in vain .
Do not incriminate a servant to his master , or he will curse you could be found guilty .
There is a generation that curses their father , and doe not bless their mother .
There is a generation pure in their own eyes , and yet not washed from their filthiness .
There is a generation , O how lofty are their eyes ! Their eyelids are lifted up .
There is a generation , whose teeth are like swords , and their jaw teeth like knives , to devour the poor from off the earth , and the needy from among men .
The leach has two daughters . Each cry : » Give , « » Give ! « There are three things that are never satisfied , yes ; even four things never say : » It is enough ! «
The grave ; and the barren womb ; the earth that is not filled with water ; and the fire that does not say : » It is enough . «
The eye that mocks his father , and rejects obedience to his mother , the ravens of the valley pick it out , and the young eagles eat it .
There are three things that are too wonderful for me , yes , four I do not know :
The way of an eagle in the air ; the way of a serpent upon a rock ; the way of a ship in the middle of the sea ; and the way of a man with a maid .
Such is the way of an adulterous woman . She eats and wipes her mouth , and says : » I have done no wickedness . «
Under three things the earth is disquieted , and for four it cannot bear :
For a servant when he reigns ; and a fool when he is filled with food ;
For a detestable woman when she is married ; and a handmaid who is heir to her mistress .
There are four things that are little upon the earth , but they chakam : teach wisdom are exceeding wise :
The ants are beings that are not strong , yet they prepare their food in the summer .
The rock badgers are a feeble folk , yet they make their houses in the rocks .
The locusts have no king , yet they advance in ranks .
The spider grasps with her hands , and in kings' palaces .
» There are three things that go well , yes , four go well :
A lion is strongest among beasts and does not run from anything .
A greyhound , a he goat also and a king , against whom there is no rising up .
If you foolishly exalted yourself , or if you thought evil , lay your hand upon your mouth .
Surely the churning of milk brings butter , and the wringing of the nose brings blood , so the forcing of wrath brings strife .
The words of king Lemuel , the prophecy that his mother taught him .
What , O my son ? And what , O son of my womb ? And what , O son of my vows ?
Do not give your strength to women . Do not give your ways to that which destroys kings .
It is not for kings , O Lemuel ; it is not for kings to drink wine ; nor for princes to desire strong drink .
They will drink and forget the law , and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted .
Give strong drink to him who is ready to perish , and wine to those who are bitter .
Let him drink and forget his poverty . Let him remember his misery no more .
Open your mouth for the dumb in the cause of all who are appointed to destruction .
Open your mouth and judge righteously . Plead the cause of the poor and needy .
Who can find a virtuous woman ? For her value is far above corals .
The heart of her husband safely trusts her . He will have no lack of gain .
She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life .
She seeks wool , and flax , and works willingly with her hands .
She is like the merchants' ships for she brings her food from afar .
She rises while it is still night and provides food for her household , and a portion to her maidens .
She considers a field and buys it . With the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard .
She fortifies herself with strength and strengthens her arms .
She perceives that her merchandise is good . Her candle does not go out at night .
She stretches her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the distaff .
She stretches out her hand to the poor . Yes , she reaches forth her hands to the needy .
She is not afraid of the snow for her household . All her household is clothed with scarlet .
She makes herself coverings of tapestry . Her clothing is silk and purple .
Her husband is known in the gates when he sits among the elders of the land .
She makes fine linen and sells it . She supplies sashes for the merchants .
Strength and honor are her clothing . She will rejoice in time to come .
She opens her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness she speaks kind things .
She watches over her household , and does not eat the bread of idleness .
Her children arise up and call her blessed . Her husband also praises her .
Many daughters have done well , but you are above them all .
Charm is deceitful , and beauty is vain . But a woman who respects Jehovah will be praised .
Give her of the fruit of her hands . Let her own works praise her in the gates .
The words of the Preacher assembler lecturer , the son of David , king in Jerusalem .
» Vanity of vanities , « said the Preacher , » vanity of vanities ; all is vanity . «
What profit does a man have of all his labor that he works under the sun ?
One generation goes and another generation comes , but the earth remains forever without end .
The sun rises and the sun goes down , and it quickly goes back to the place where it began .
The wind blows toward the south , and it turns around to the north . It whirls around continually and the wind returns on its circuits .
All the rivers run into the sea yet the sea is not full . The rivers return to the place where they began .
All things are wearisome , man is not able to tell . The eye is not satisfied with seeing , nor the ear filled with hearing .
That which has been is that which will be . That which has been done is that which will be done . There is nothing new under the sun !
Is there anything of which it may be said : » See , this is new ? « It has already existed in days of old , which were before us .
There is no memory of former things . Those who follow will not remember those who are yet to come .
I , the Preacher , was king over Israel in Jerusalem .
I devoted myself to study and explored wisdom concerning all that is done under the heavens . It is a grievous task God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with .
I have seen all the works that are done under the sun . Behold , all is vanity and a striving after wind .
What is crooked cannot be made straight . What is lacking cannot be numbered .
I said to my heart , » I have become great and have aquired more wisdom than all who were before me in Jerusalem . Yes , my heart has seen an abundance of wisdom and knowledge . «
I gave my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly . I know that this also is a striving after wind .
In much wisdom there is much grief for he who increases knowledge increases pain .
I said in my heart , » Come now , I will test you with rejoicing . Consider goodness . « This also is vanity .
I said of laughter : » It is madness . And of pleasure : What does it do ? «
I searched in my mind how to stimulate my flesh with wine . My mind guided my heart with wisdom . I possessed foolishness until I could see what was good for the sons of men . I saw what they should do under the heavens all the days of their life .
I made great works . I built houses for myself . I planted vineyards for myself .
I made myself parks and fruit gardens , planting in them fruit-trees of all kinds .
I made water pools from which to water the young trees .
I acquired male and female servants , and they gave birth to sons and daughters in my house . I had great wealth of herds and flocks , more than all who were in Jerusalem before me .
I gathered silver and gold and the wealth of kings and of countries . I acquired male and female singers , the delights of the sons of men , girls of all sorts to be my brides .
I became great and increased more than all who had been before me in Jerusalem and my wisdom remained with me .
Whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them . I did not withhold joy from my heart . My heart took pleasure in all my work and this was my reward .
I looked at all the works my hands accomplished . I saw everything I had worked to do . I saw that all was vanity and grasping for the wind . It was to no purpose for there was no profit under the sun .
I went again in search of wisdom and of foolish ways . What can the man do that comes after the king ? Only what he has already done .
Then I saw that wisdom is better than foolish ways just as the light is better than the dark .
The wise man's eyes are in his head , but the foolish man walks in darkness . Yet I saw that the same event happens to them all .
Then I said in my heart : » As it happens to the fool , so it will happen to me . Why have I been so wise ? « Then I said in my heart : » This also is vanity . «
Neither the wise man nor the foolish man will be remembered for long . All that now is will be forgotten in the days to come . Death comes to both the wise and the foolish .
I hated life . Everything under the sun was evil to me . All is vanity and grasping for the wind .
I hated all the work I had done under the sun , because I would leave it behind for the man who comes after me .
Who knows if he will be a wise man or a fool ? But he will have power over all the work that I have done and in which I have been wise under the sun . This too is vanity .
My heart turned to grief over all for which I had labored and all my wisdom under the sun .
Because there is a man whose work has been done with wisdom , with knowledge , and with an expert hand . But one who has done nothing for it will have it for his heritage . This also is vanity and a great evil .
What does a man get for all his work , and for the desire of his heart with which he has done his work under the sun ?
All his days are sorrow , and his work is full of grief . Even in the night his heart has no rest . This again is vanity .
There is nothing better for a man than to eat and drink , and delight in his work . This also I saw was from the hand of God .
After all , who eats and who drinks better than I ?
To the man who is good , God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy . But to the sinner he gives the work of getting goods together and storing up wealth , to give to him who is good before God . This also is vanity and grasping for the wind .
For everything there is a season . There is a time for every purpose under the sun .
There is a time to be born , and a time to die ; a time to plant , and a time to pull up what is planted ;
a time to kill , and a time to heal ; a time to break down , and a time to build up ;
a time to weep , and a time to laugh ; a time to mourn , and a time to dance ;
a time to throw away stones , and a time to gather stones together ; a time to embrace , and a time to refrain from embracing ;
a time to get and a time to lose ; a time to keep and a time to throw away .
There is a time to tear and a time to sew , a time to keep silence and a time to speak .
There is also a time to love and a time to hate , a time of war and a time of peace .
What profit is there to the worker in his work ?
I have seen the task that God has given with which the sons of men are occupied .
He made everything appropriate beautiful good in its time . God placed eternity in the heart of man . For man is unable to see the works of God from the first to the last .
I am certain that there is nothing better for a man than to rejoice and to do good works in life .
Every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labor . It is the gift of God .
I know that whatever God does it will be forever . Nothing can be added to it , nor any thing taken from it . God does it in order that men should reverence respect him .
That which is has already been and that which is to be has already been . God seeks what has passed by .
I saw under the sun the place of judgment and wickedness was there . And wickedness was in the place of righteousness .
I said in my heart , » God should judge the righteous and the wicked for there is a time for every purpose and for every work . «
I said in my heart concerning the condition of the sons of men , » God tested them that they might see that they are like animals . «
What happens to the sons of men also happens to animals . As the one dies so the other dies . Yes , they all have one breath so that a man has no advantage over animals . For all is vanity .
All go to one place . All came from the dust and all return to dust .
Who knows the breath of man that goes upward , and the breath of the animal that goes downward to the earth ?
I see there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his own works . That is his portion . Who will bring him to see what will happen after him ?
I returned and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun . I saw the tears of the oppressed for they had no one to comfort them . The oppressors had power but they had no one to comfort them .
I praised the dead who are already dead more than the living who are yet alive .
Better off then both of them is the one who has not ever been , who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun .
I have learned why people work so hard to succeed . It is because they envy the things their neighbors have . But it is vanity ! It is like chasing the wind .
They say that we would be fools to fold our hands and let ourselves starve to death .
One hand full of quietness is better than two hands full of trouble and striving after wind .
Then I came back and saw vanity under the sun .
There is a man who is by himself , without a companion . He is without son or brother . There is no end to all his work . He never has enough wealth . Nor is his eye satisfied with riches . He never asks : » For whom do I labor and deprive myself of pleasure ? « This too is vanity and a terrible problem .
Two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labor .
If they fall , the one will lift up his companion . Woe to him who is alone when he falls for he has no one to help him .
If two lies down together they keep warm . How can one be warm alone ?
One can be overpowered by another , two can withstand him ; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken .
Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king who will no longer take advise .
He comes out of prison to rule as king . He that is born in his kingdom becomes poor .
I considered all the living that walk under the sun , with the second child that will stand up in the king’s place .
There is no end of all the people , even of all that have been before them . Those who come later will not rejoice in him . Surely this also is vanity and grasping for the wind .
Guard your step when you go to the house of God . It is better to go there and listen than to bring the sacrifices fools bring . Fools are not aware that they do evil .
Do not be in a hurry to talk . Do not be eager to speak in the presence of God . Since God is in heaven and you are on earth , limit the number of your words .
Dreams come with many efforts , trials and concerns . Fools speak with too many words .
Do not be late in paying a vow you make to God . He takes no delight in fools . Pay what you vow !
It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay .
Do not let your speech cause you to sin . Do not say to the messenger of God that it was a mistake . Why should God be angry because of what you say and destroy the work of your hands ?
There is futility and emptiness in many dreams and in many words . Reverence God .
If you see oppression of the poor and denial of justice and righteousness in the country , do not be shocked at the sight . One official watches over another official and there are higher officials over them .
A king who cultivates the field is an advantage to the land .
He who loves money will not be satisfied with money , nor he who loves wealth , with gain . This too is vanity .
When good things increase , those who consume them increase . So what is the advantage to their owners except to see them ?
The sleep of the workingman is pleasant , whether he eats little or much . However the full stomach of the rich man does not allow him to sleep .
I have seen a grievous evil under the sun . I have seen riches being hoarded by their owner to his downfall distress .
When those riches were lost through a bad investment and he fathered a son , then there was no support for him .
We entered this world with nothing and naked and we will leave this world with nothing and naked .
This also is a serious evil . Just as we came we will go . Whatever profit or gain we earned we loose as if we labored for the wind .
All his days he eats in darkness . He has much sorrow and anger with his sickness .
This is what I have seen . It is good and fitting for one to eat and drink and enjoy the good of his labor . He labors under the sun all the days of his life . For God gives this to him as his allotment inheritance .
For every man to whom God has given riches and wealth , He has empowered him to eat because of them . He should receive his reward and rejoice in his labor . This is the gift of God .
He will not often remember the years of his life . This is because God keeps him occupied with the gladness pleasure of his heart .
There is an evil that I have seen under the sun and it is prevalent among men .
God has given man riches , wealth and honor , so that he lacks nothing of all that he desires . Yet God has not empowered him to partake of them for a foreigner enjoys them . This is vanity and a severe affliction .
A man can have a hundred children and live many years . If he does not enjoy prosperity and have a decent burial , a stillborn child is better off then he .
For he comes in with vanity and departs in darkness , and his name will be covered with darkness .
» Moreover he has not seen the sun nor known anything . The stillborn child has more rest than the other .
» Even though he lives a thousand years twice over , yet he has seen no good . Do not all go to one place ? «
All the labor of man is for his mouth and yet the appetite is not satisfied .
What does the wise have more than the fool ? What does the poor have knowing how to walk before man ?
Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering after the desire . This is also vanity and a striving after wind .
That which exists is named already . It is known and he cannot dispute with the one that is mightier than he .
Seeing there is much that increases futility , what outcome is there for man ?
Who knows what is good for man in this life ? Are all the days of his vain life that he spends like a shadow ? Who can tell a man what will happen after his existence under the sun ?
A good name honor renown reputation is better than pleasant ointment and the day of death than the day of one's birth .
It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting . That is the end for all men and the living takes it to heart .
Sorrow is better than laughter : for by the sadness the appearance of the heart is made better .
The heart feelings of the wise is in the house of mourning . The heart of fools is in the house of rejoicing .
It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise , than for a man to hear the song of fools .
For as the crackling of thorns under a pot , so is the laughter of the fool : this also is vanity .
Oppression makes a wise man foolish emotionally unstable mentally ill and a bribe destroys the heart .
Better is the end of a thing than its beginning . The patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit .
Do not be quick in your spirit mind figurative heart to be angry . Anger rests in the bosom of fools .
Do not ask : » Why were the old days better then these ? « You do not inquire wisely about this .
Wisdom is good as an inheritance : It is an advantage to those who see the sun .
Wisdom is a shelter just as money is a shelter . The advantage of knowledge is that wisdom gives lift to those who have it .
Consider the work of God . Who can make straight what he has made crooked ?
In the day of prosperity be joyful , but in the day of adversity consider that God made one as well as the other , to the end that man should find nothing that comes after him .
I have seen all things in the days of my vanity . There is a just man who perished in his righteousness , and there is a wicked man who prolonged his life in his wickedness .
Do not be righteous over much and do not be wise over much . Why should you destroy yourself ?
Do not be wicked over much and do not be foolish . Why should you die before your time ?
It is good that you should take hold of this and also from this not withdraw your hand , for he who respects God will come forth from them all .
Wisdom strengthens the wise more than ten mighty men who are in the city .
There is no man on earth who is righteous and does not sin .
Do not pay attention to everything that is said lest you hear your servant curse you .
Often your own heart knows you have also cursed others .
I have tried and proved all this by wisdom . I said : » I will be wise « but it was far from me .
That which is far off , and exceedingly deep , who can find it out ?
I applied my heart to know , and to search , and to seek out wisdom . I looked for the explanation , and to know the wickedness of folly , even of foolishness and madness .
I find what was worse than death is the woman whose heart is snares and nets , and her hands are chains . He who pleases God will escape from her . But she will capture the sinner .
» Behold , this I have found , « says the preacher , » counting one by one to find out the account : «
For I am still seeking and have not found . One man among a thousand I have found ; but a woman among all those I have not found .
» You see ! I have found only this , that God made man upright . But they have sought out many devices schemes reasonings . «
Who is like the wise man ? Who knows the interpretation of a message ? A man's wisdom illuminates him , and the hardness of his countenance appearance is changed .
I counsel you : » Keep the king's command because of the oath before God . «
» Do not be in a hurry to leave him . Do not persist in an evil activity , for he does whatever he pleases . «
There is power authority in the word of a king . Who may ask him : » What are you doing ? «
He who obeys the king’s command will feel no harm . A wise man's heart discerns both time and judgment .
This is because to every purpose there is time and judgment . Even so man’s misery is great .
For he does not know what will be and who can tell him how and when it will be ?
No man has the power to restrain the wind , to retain the breath of life . Neither does he have power in the day of death . There is no discharge from that war . Neither will wickedness deliver those who are given to it .
I have seen all this and applied my heart to every work that is done under the sun . There is a time when one man rules over another to his own misery and harm .
I saw the wicked buried , those who had come and gone out of the holy place . They were forgotten in the city where they had so done . This also is vanity .
Sentence against an evil deed is not executed quickly . Therefore the hearts of the sons of men are fully committed to do evil .
Though a sinner does evil a hundred times , and he lives a long life , yet I know that it will be well with those who respect reverence God and worship him .
Things will not go well with the wicked . He will not prolong his days . His days are like a shadow . He does not respect God .
There is a futility that is done upon the earth . There are righteous men who get along as though they were wicked and there are wicked men who get along as though they were righteous . I said that this also is vanity .
Then I commended enjoyment pleasure , because a man has no better thing under the sun , than to eat , and to drink , and to be merry . That will remain with him in his labor all the days of his life , which God gives him under the sun .
When I applied my heart to know wisdom , and to see the business that is done on the earth : for also there is that neither day nor night sees sleep with his eyes
I saw all the work of God . A man cannot discover the work that is done under the sun . Though a man labor to seek it out , yet he will not find it . Though a wise man thinks to know it , yet he will not be able to find it .
I considered all this in my heart and declared that the righteous and their works are in the hand of God . No man knows if love or hatred awaits him in the future .
The same thing comes to all . There is one event to the righteous and to the wicked ; to the good and to the clean , and to the unclean ; to him that sacrifices and to him that does not sacrifice . As is the good , so is the sinner ; and he that swears , as he that fears and refrains from an oath .
This evil is in all things that are done under the sun . There is one event that comes to all . The heart of the sons of men is full of evil . Madness is in their heart while they live . After that they go to the dead die .
Whoever is joined to all the living has hope . A living dog is better than a dead lion .
The living know that they will die ! The dead do not know anything . They do not have any more reward . Their memory is forgotten .
Their love , their hatred , and their envy , is now gone , perished ! They do not share anything that is done under the sun .
Go your way , eat your bread with joy , and drink your wine with a merry heart for God now accepts your works .
Let your garments be always white ; and let your head lack no ointment .
Live joyfully with the wife whom you love all the days of the life he has given you under the sun , all the days of your vanity . That is your share in this life and in your labor under the sun .
Whatever your hand finds to do , do it with your might ; for there is no work , nor device , nor knowledge , nor wisdom , in the grave , where you are going .
I returned , and saw under the sun , that the race is not to the swift . The battle is not to the strong . Bread does not go to the wise , or riches to men of understanding . Men of skill do not always receive favor , but time and unexpected circumstance happens to them all .
For man does not know his time . Like fish caught in an evil net , and like birds caught in the snare ; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time , when it falls suddenly upon them .
I have seen this wisdom under the sun , and it seemed important to me .
There was a little city with a small population . A great king moved against it . He built great bulwarks against it and attacked it .
Now there was found in it a poor wise man . By his wisdom he delivered the city . Yet no man remembered that same poor man .
Then I said : » Wisdom is better than strength . « Nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised , and his words are not heard .
The words of the wise heard in quietness are more than the loud cry of the ruler of fools .
Wisdom is better than weapons of war , yet one sinner destroys much good .
Dead flies cause the perfumer’s oil to smell . A little foolishness does the same for the one with a reputation for wisdom and honor .
A wise man's heart is at his right hand and a fool's heart at his left .
When he who is a fool walks along the path , his wisdom fails him , and he says to every one that he is a fool .
If the temper of the ruler rises up against you do not withdraw from him for gentleness can put a stop to great offenses .
There is an evil that I have seen under the sun . It is like an error that proceeds from the ruler .
Craziness is set in many exalted places , and the rich sit in low places .
I have seen servants upon horses , and princes walking like servants upon the earth .
He that digs a pit will fall into it . A serpent will bite whoever breaks through a hedge .
Whoever removes landmark stones will be hurt . They will endanger the one who cuts down trees .
If the ax is dull , and he does not whet the edge , he must put forth more effort . Wisdom helps him to succeed .
Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment . A slanderer is no better than an uncharmed snake .
The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious ; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself .
The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness . The result of his talk is mischievous madness .
A fool also is full of words . A man cannot predict what will be and what will be after him . Who can tell him ?
The labor of the foolish wearies everyone of them , because he does not know how to go to the city .
Woe to you , O land , when your king is a child and your princes eat in the morning !
You are blessed , O land , when your king is the son of nobles and your princes eat in due season , for strength , and not for drunkenness !
By indolence the building decays ; and through idleness of the hands the house collapses .
A feast is made for laughter and wine makes merry , but money answers all things .
Do not curse the king , no not even in thought . Do not curse the rich in your bedchamber for a bird of the air will carry the voice , and that which has wings will tell the matter .
Cast your bread upon the waters , for you will find it after many days .
Give a portion to seven , and even to eight . You do not know what calamity will be upon the earth .
If the clouds are full of rain they empty themselves upon the earth . If the tree falls toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree falls , there it will be .
He who observes the wind will not sow and he that regards the clouds will not reap .
You do not know what is the way of the wind , nor how the bones grow in the womb of a pregnant woman . Even so you do not know the works of God who creates all .
In the morning sow your seed . In the evening do not withhold your hand . For you do not know which shall prosper . Whether they both will alike be good .
Truly the light is sweet , and it is a pleasant thing for the eyes to behold the sun .
If a man live many years , and rejoice in them all ; yet let him remember the days of darkness for they will be many . All that comes is vanity .
Rejoice , O young man , in your youth . Let your heart cheer you in your early days . Walk in the ways of your heart , and in the desires of your eyes . Yet you know that God will bring you into judgment for all these things .
Therefore remove sorrow from your heart , and put away evil from your flesh , for childhood and youth are vanity .
Remember your Creator Hebrew : Bara ’ , plural , Creators denotes majesty in the days of your youth , before the evil days come and the years draw near . You will say : » I have no pleasure in them . «
Before the sun , or the light , or the moon , or the stars , are darkened , or the clouds return after the rain :
In the day when the keepers of the house will tremble , and the strong men will bow themselves , and the grinders cease because they are few , and those that look out of the windows are darkened ,
And the doors will be shut in the streets . When the sound of the grinding is low he will rise up at the voice of the bird , and all the daughters of music will be brought low .
Also when they will be afraid of what is high , and fears will be in the way , and the almond tree will flourish , and the grasshopper will be a burden , and the caper berry breaks and desire fails , man goes to his long lasting home and the mourners go about the streets .
When the silver cord is snapped apart , or the golden bowl is broken , or the pitcher is broken at the fountain , or the wheel broken at the cistern .
Then the dust will return to the earth as it was . The spirit life will return to God who gave it .
» Vanity of vanities , « says the preacher ; » all is vanity . «
Moreover , because the preacher was wise , he still taught the people knowledge . He gave good heed , and sought out , and set in order many proverbs .
The preacher sought to find out acceptable words . That which was written was upright , even words of truth .
The words of the wise are like prodding goads , and like nails fastened by the masters of assemblies . They are given from one shepherd .
By these , my son , be admonished ! There is no end to publishing many books . Also much study is a weariness of the flesh .
Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter : Respect God , and obey his commandments for this is the whole duty of man .
For God will bring every work into judgment with every secret thing , whether it is good or whether it is evil .
The Song of Songs , which is Solomon's .
( The Shulamite ) Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth . Your love is better than wine .
» Your good ointment has a pleasing aroma . Your name is like pure ointment . Therefore the maidens do love you .
» Draw me away . Daughters of Jerusalem » We will run after you . « The Shulamite » The king brought me into his chambers . « Daughters of Jerusalem » We will be glad and rejoice in you . We will remember your love more than wine ! « The Shulamite » They are right to love you . «
» I am lovely and black , O you daughters of Jerusalem . I am like the tents of Kedar and the curtains of Solomon .
» Do not look at me because I am black . The sun has tanned me . My mother's sons were angry with me . They made me the keeper of the vineyards . I have not kept my own vineyard !
( To Her Beloved ) Tell me , O you whom I love where you feed your flock and where you make it rest at noon . Why should I be as one who veils herself by the flocks of your companions ?
( The Beloved ) If you do not know , O you fairest among women , follow the footsteps of the flock . Feed your kids beside the shepherds' tents .
» I have compared you , O my love , to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots .
» Your cheeks are lovely with jewels and your neck with chains of gold . «
( Daughters of Jerusalem ) We will make you ornaments of gold with studs of silver .
( The Shulamite ) While the king sits at his table , my perfume sends forth its fragrance .
» My beloved is like a cluster of myrrh to me . He will lie all night between my breasts .
» My beloved is to me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of En-gedi . «
( The Beloved ) Behold , you are fair , my love  . Behold , you are fair . You have doves' eyes .
( The Shulamite ) Behold , you are handsome , my beloved , yes , pleasant ! Also our bed is green .
» The beams of our house are cedar , and our rafters of fir .
» I am the rose of Sharon , the lily of the valleys . «
( The Beloved ) My love among the daughters is like a lily among thorns .
( The Shulamite ) Just like the apple tree among the trees of the wood so is my beloved among the sons . I sat down under his shadow with great delight , and his fruit was sweet to my taste .
( The Shulamite to the Daughters of Jerusalem ) He brought me to the banquet hall . His banner over me was love .
» Sustain me with raisin cakes . Refresh me with apples : for I am lovesick .
» His left hand is under my head . His right hand embraces me . «
» I charge you , O you daughters of Jerusalem , by the gazelles , and by the deer of the field : Do not stir up nor awaken love until it pleases . «
( The Shulamite ) The voice of my beloved ! Behold , he comes leaping upon the mountains , skipping upon the hills .
» My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag . Behold , he stands behind our wall , he looks through the windows , gazing through the lattice .
» My beloved spoke , and said to me , ‘ Raise up , my love , my fair one , and come away .
» For , lo , the winter is past , the rain is over and gone .
‘ The flowers appear on the earth . The time of singing birds has come . The voice of the turtle is heard in our land .
‘ The fig tree puts forth her green figs , and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell . Arise , my love , my fair one , and come away ! ’ «
» O my dove , you are in the clefts of the rock , in the secret places of the stairs . Let me see your countenance . Let me hear your voice . For sweet is your voice , and your countenance is lovely . «
( Her Brothers ) Catch the foxes for us , the little foxes that spoil the vines : for our vines have tender grapes .
( The Shulamite ) My beloved is mine and I am his . He feeds among the lilies .
( To Her Beloved ) Until the daybreaks and the shadows flee away , turn my beloved , and be like a gazelle or a young stag upon the mountains of Bether .
( The Shulamite ) By night on my bed I sought the one I love . I sought him , but I did not find him .
» I will rise now , and go about the city in the streets . I will seek the one I love in the streets and broad ways . I sought him , but I did not find him .
» The watchmen who go about the city found me . I said to them : ‘ Did you see the one I love ? ’
» Shortly after I passed by them , I found the one I love . I held him , and would not let him go , until I brought him to my mother's house , and into the chamber of her that conceived me . ’ «
» I charge you , O you daughters of Jerusalem , by the gazelles and by the deer of the field , that you do not stir nor awake my love , till he pleases . «
» Who is this that comes out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke , perfumed with myrrh and frankincense , with all powders of the merchant ?
» Behold it is Solomon's couch with sixty valiant men around it , of the valiant of Israel .
» They all hold swords . They are experts in war . Every man has his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night .
» King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon .
» He made the pillars of silver ; the bottom of gold and its cover was of purple . The interior was paved with love , for the daughters of Jerusalem .
» Go forth , O you daughters of Zion , and behold king Solomon with the crown that his mother crowned him with in the day of his wedding , and in the day of the gladness of his heart . «
( The Beloved ) You are beautiful my love , you are beautiful . Your eyes behind your veil are like doves . Your hair is like a flock of goats descending from Mount Gilead .
» Your teeth are like a flock of sheep that are shorn and washed . Each has its twin and not one of them is alone .
» Your lips are like a thread of scarlet and your mouth is lovely . Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within your locks .
» Your neck is like the tower of David built for an armory , on which there hang a thousand bucklers , all shields of mighty men .
» Your two breasts are like two young gazelles that are twins , which feed among the lilies .
» Until the daybreaks , and the shadows flee away , I will go to the mountain of myrrh , and to the hill of frankincense .
» You are all fair , my love . There is no spot in you .
» Come with me from Lebanon , my spouse , with me from Lebanon ! Look from the peak of Mount Amana , from the peak of Mount Shenir and Mount Hermon , from the lions' dens , from the mountains of the leopards .
» You have ravished my heart , my sister , and my spouse . You have ravished my heart with one of your eyes , with one chain around your neck .
» How fair is your love , my sister , and my spouse ! How much better is your love than wine ! The smell of your perfume than all spices !
» Your lips , O my spouse , drop as the honeycomb : honey and milk are under your tongue ; and the smell of your garments is like the smell of Lebanon .
» A garden enclosed is my sister , my spouse ; a spring shut up , a fountain sealed .
» Your plants are an orchard of pomegranates , with pleasant fruits ; camphire , with ointment ,
» Ointment and saffron ; calamus and cinnamon , with all trees of frankincense ; myrrh and aloes , with all the chief spices :
» A fountain of gardens , a well of living waters , and streams from Lebanon . «
( The Shulamite ) Awake , O north wind ; and come south ; blow upon my garden that the spices may flow out . Let my beloved come into his garden , and eat his pleasant fruits .
( The Beloved ) I came to my garden , my sister , my spouse . I gathered my myrrh with my spice . I ate my honeycomb with my honey and drank my wine with my milk . Eat , O friends ; drink , yes , drink abundantly , O beloved .
( The Shulamite ) I sleep , but my heart is awake . It is the voice of my beloved that knocks , saying : ' Open to me , my sister , my love , my dove , my undefiled : for my head is filled with dew , and my locks with the drops of the night . '
» I have removed my coat . How shall I put it on ? I have washed my feet . How shall I defile them ?
» My beloved extended his hand through the latch opening of the door . My heart yearned for him .
» I rose up to open to my beloved . My hands dripped with myrrh . My fingers were sweet from sweet smelling myrrh and they grasped the lock handles .
» I opened to my beloved ; but my beloved had withdrawn himself , and was gone . My heart jumped when he spoke . I sought him , but I could not find him . I called him , but he did not answer .
» The watchmen that went about the city found me , they struck me , they wounded me ; the keepers of the walls took my veil from me .
» I charge you , O daughters of Jerusalem , if you find my beloved , that you tell him , that I am lovesick . «
( Daughters of Jerusalem ) Is your beloved more than another beloved , O you fairest among women ? Is your beloved more than another beloved that you so charge us ?
( The Shulamite ) My beloved is white and ruddy , the chief among ten thousand .
» His head is as the finest gold . His locks are like date clusters , bushy and black as a raven .
» His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters , washed with milk , and fitly set .
» His cheeks are as a bed of spices , as sweet flowers . His lips are like lilies , dripping sweet smelling myrrh .
» His hands are as gold rings set with beryl . His belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires .
» His legs are like pillars of marble , set upon sockets of fine gold . His countenance is like Lebanon , excellent as the cedars .
» His mouth is very sweet : yes , he is altogether handsome . This is my beloved , and this is my friend , O daughters of Jerusalem . «
( Daughters of Jerusalem ) Where has your beloved one gone , O you fairest among women ? Where has your beloved turned aside that we may seek him with you ?
( The Shulamite ) My beloved went to his garden , to the beds of spices , to feed in the gardens , and to gather lilies .
» I am my beloved’s , and my beloved is mine . He feeds among the lilies . «
( The Beloved ) You are beautiful , O my love , as Tirzah , comely as Jerusalem , terrible as an army with banners .
» Turn away your eyes from me , for they have overcome me . Your hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead .
» Your teeth are like a flock of sheep which go up from the washing , whereof every one looks like twins , and there is not one barren among them .
» Your temples within your locks are like a piece of a pomegranate .
» There are sixty queens , and eighty concubines , and virgins without number .
» My dove , my undefiled is the one . She is the only one of her mother ; she is the choice one of her that bore her . The daughters saw her , and blessed her . The queens and the concubines praised her .
» Who is she who looks as the morning , fair as the moon , clear as the sun , and terrible as an army with banners ?
( The Shulamite ) I went down into the garden of nut trees to see the fruits of the valley , to see whether the vine flourished , and the pomegranates budded .
» Before I was aware of it my desire set me among the royal chariots of my people .
( Beloved and his Friends ) Return , return , O Shulamite return , return , that we may look at you . ( The Shulamite ) What will you see in the Shulamite ? It was the company of two camps .
( The Beloved ) How beautiful are your feet in sandals , O prince's daughter ! The joints of your thighs are like jewels , the work of the hands of a cunning workman .
» Your navel is like a round goblet . It does not need liquor . Your belly is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies .
» Your two breasts are like two young fawns that are twins .
» Your neck is as a tower of ivory . Your eyes like the fish pools in Heshbon , by the gate of Bathrabbim . Your nose is as the tower of Lebanon that looks toward Damascus .
» Your head is like Carmel , and the hair of your head like purple ; the king is held in the galleries .
» How fair and how pleasant you are , O love , for delights !
» Your stature is like a palm tree , and your breasts like clusters of dates .
» I said , ‘ I will go up to the palm tree , I will take hold of the boughs . Also your breasts shall be as clusters of the vine , and the smell of your nose like apples . ’
» The roof of your mouth is like the best wine for my beloved . ’ « The Shulamite » The wine goes down sweetly , causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak .
» I belong to my beloved . His desire is toward me .
» Come , my beloved , let us go into the field . Let us lodge in the villages .
» Let us get up early to the vineyards . Let us see if the vine flourish , whether the tender grape appear , and the pomegranates bud forth . There I will give you my love .
» The mandrakes give a smell , and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits , new and old , which I have laid up for you , O my beloved .
» If only you were like my brother , that sucked the breasts of my mother ! When I find you outside I would kiss you . I would not be despised .
» I would lead you to my mother's house . She would instruct me . I would induce you to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate .
( To the Daughters of Jerusalem ) His left hand should be under my head , and his right hand should embrace me .
» I charge you , O daughters of Jerusalem , do not stir me up or awake my love until he pleases . «
( A Relative ) Who is this woman who comes up from the wilderness , leaning upon her beloved ? I raised you up under the apple tree . There your mother experienced birth pains .
( The Shulamite to her Beloved ) Set me as a signature ring seal upon your heart , as a seal upon your arm . For Love is as strong as death . Zeal ( devotion ) is as fixed as the grave . And zeal burns like coals of fire , the very flame of Jehovah .
» Many waters cannot quench love . Rivers cannot wash it away . If a man would give all the riches of his house for love , it would be utterly despised . «
( The Shulamite's Brother ) We have a little sister , and she has no breasts . What shall we do for our sister in the day when she will be spoken for ?
» If she were a wall , we would build upon her a palace of silver . If she were a door , we would enclose her with boards of cedar . «
( The Shulamite ) I am a wall , and my breasts are like towers . I was the one who found favor in his eyes .
» Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon . He leased the vineyard to keepers . Every one was to bring a thousand pieces of silver for its fruit . «
( To Solomon ) My vineyard , which is mine , is before me . You , O Solomon , must have a thousand , and those that tend the fruit two hundred .
( The Beloved ) You who dwell in the gardens , the companions listen to your voice . Cause me to hear it .
( The Shulamite ) Make haste , my beloved , and be like a gazelle or a young stag upon the mountains of spices .
This is the vision seen by Isaiah the son of Amoz . It is about Judah and Jerusalem at the time of Kings Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah .
Listen , heaven , and pay attention , earth ! Jehovah has spoken : » I raised my children and helped them grow , but they have rebelled against me .
» The bull knows its owner , and donkey knows where its master feeds it . But Israel does not know . My people do not understand ! «
Woe to the sinful nation , people heavy with iniquity , a seed of evildoers , sons who are corrupt ! They have forsaken Jehovah ! They have despised the Holy One of Israel . They have turned away from him .
Why do you still want to be beaten ? Why do you continue to rebel ? Your whole head is infected . Your whole heart is sick .
From the bottom of your feet to the top of your head there is no healthy spot left on your body . You have only bruises , sores , and fresh wounds . They have not been cleansed , bandaged , or soothed with oil .
Your country is desolate . Your cities are burned with fire . Foreigners destroy your fields in your presence . Your fields are devastated and taken over by strangers .
My people , the daughter of Zion is left like an empty hut in a vineyard . It is like a shack in a cucumber field , like a city under attack .
If Jehovah of Hosts had not left us a few survivors , we would have been like Sodom and Gomorrah .
Listen to the word of Jehovah , you rulers of Sodom ! Pay attention to the Law of our God , you people of Gomorrah !
Jehovah says : » What do your many animal sacrifices mean to me ? I have had enough of your burnt offerings of rams and enough fat from your fattened calves . I am not pleased with the blood of bulls , lambs , or male goats .
» Who requires you to trample on my courtyards when you appear in my presence ?
» Do not bring any more worthless grain offerings . Your incense is disgusting to me ! So are your New Moon Festivals , your days of worship , and the assemblies you call . I cannot endure your evil assemblies !
» I hate your New Moon Festivals and your appointed festivals . They are a burden to me . I am tired of putting up with them .
» When you spread out your hands in prayer , I will hide my eyes from you . Even though you offer many prayers , I will not listen because your hands are full of blood .
» Wash yourselves ! Become clean ! Get your evil deeds out of my sight . Stop doing evil .
» Learn to do good well right . Seek justice . Correct oppressors . Defend orphans . Plead the case of widows . «
» Come now , let us reason together make things right correct matters between us ! « Says Jehovah . » Though your sins are like scarlet , they will become as white as snow . Though they are red like crimson , they will become as white as wool .
» If you are willing and obedient , you will eat the best from the land .
» Refuse and rebel and swords will devour you . Jehovah has spoken . «
How the faithful town has become a prostitute ! She was full of justice , and righteousness lived in her . But now murderers live there !
Your silver is not pure . Your beer is watered down .
Your rulers are rebels , friends with thieves . They all love bribes and run after gifts . They never defend orphans . They do not listen to the widows' pleas .
That is why Jehovah , Jehovah of Hosts , the Mighty One of Israel , says : » How horrible it will be when I take revenge on my opponents ! I will avenge myself against my enemies .
» I will turn my power against you turn the back of my hand upon you . I will remove your impurities with bleach . I will get rid of all your worthless qualities .
» I will give you judges like you had long ago , advisers like you had in the beginning . After that you will be called the Righteous City , the Faithful City . «
Jehovah’s justice will pardon Zion . Those who return will be pardoned by Jehovah’s righteousness .
Rebels and sinners will be crushed at the same time . Those who abandon Jehovah will come to an end .
You will be ashamed of the oaks that you wanted to worship . You will be embarrassed by the garden that you have chosen for your gods .
You will be like an oak whose leaves wither and like a garden without water .
Strong people will become tinder for a fire . Their work will be the spark . Both of them will burn together . There will be no one to put out the fire .
The vision and prophetic message Isaiah , son of Amoz , saw about Judah and Jerusalem .
In the last days the mountain of the house of Jehovah will be established as the highest of the mountains and exalted above the hills . All the nations will stream to it .
Then many people will come and say : » Let us go to the mountain of Jehovah , to the House of the God of Jacob . He will teach us his ways so that we may live by them . « The law will go out from Zion . The word of Jehovah will go out from Jerusalem .
Then he will judge disputes between nations and settle matters between many people . They will beat hammer their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks . Nations will not fight against each other , and they will not learn war anymore .
Come , descendants of Jacob , let us live in the light of Jehovah .
Jehovah , you have abandoned your people , the descendants of Jacob , because they are filled with Eastern influences . They practice witchcraft like the Philistines , and they make deals with foreigners .
Their land is full of silver and gold . There is no limit to their treasures . Their land is also full of horses . There is no limit to their chariots .
Their land is full of idols . They worship the work of their own hands , that which their own fingers have made .
Man has been humbled . Everyman has been humiliated . Do not forgive them .
Go in among the rocks and hide underground because of Jehovah’s terrifying presence and the magnificence of his majesty .
The arrogant people will be humbled . High and mighty people will be brought down . On that day Jehovah alone will be exalted .
All who are proud will be humbled . Jehovah of Hosts will have his day against all who are arrogant and conceited .
It will also be against all the towering and mighty cedars of Lebanon and all the oaks of Bashan ,
against all the high mountains and all the lofty hills ,
against every high tower and every fortified wall ,
and also against all the large ships of Tarshish and all the beautiful boats .
Then arrogant people will be brought down . High and mighty people will be humiliated . On that day Jehovah alone will be honored .
Then idols false gods will disappear completely .
People will go into caves in the rocks and into holes in the ground because of Jehovah’s terrifying presence and the honor of his majesty when he rises to shake the earth .
That day people will throw their silver and gold idols , that they made for themselves to worship , to the moles and the bats .
They will go into caves in the rocks and into cracks in the cliffs because of Jehovah’s terrifying presence and the honor of his majesty when he rises to shake the earth .
Stop trusting people , whose breath life is in their nostrils . How can they be worth anything ?
Jehovah of Hosts , the Almighty Ruler Sovereign is going to take all support and supply of food and water from Jerusalem and Judah .
He will take their heroes and soldiers , judges and prophets , fortunetellers and statesmen ,
military leaders and civilian leaders , counselors , skilled workers , and experts in magic .
I will make boys their leaders . Childish tyrants will govern them .
People will oppress each other . Everyone will harass his neighbor . The young will tyrannize the old . The common people will taunt their superiors .
A person will grab one of his relatives from his father's family and say : » You have a coat . You will be our leader . This pile of ruins will be under your control . «
Then the relative will cry out : » I am not a healer ! I do not have any food or a coat in my home . Do not make me a leader of the people . «
Jerusalem has stumbled , and Judah has fallen , because what they say and what they do is against Jehovah ! They are defiant in his honored presence .
The expression on their faces will be held against them . They boast about their sins ! They are like those of the people of Sodom . They do not even bother to hide them . How horrible it will be for these people . They have brought disaster on themselves .
Tell the righteous that blessings will come to them . They will taste the fruit of their labor .
How horrible it will be for the wicked ! Disaster will strike them . What they have done to others will be done to them .
Children oppress my people ! Women rule over them . O My people ! Those who guide you lead you astray . They confuse the direction of your paths .
Jehovah stands erect to assert his power . He stands to judge the people .
Jehovah enters into judgment with the elders and princes of his people : » It is you who have devoured the vineyard . The plunder of the poor is in your houses .
» What do you mean by crushing my people and grinding the face of the poor ? « Declares Jehovah of Hosts .
Jehovah also said : » Because the daughters of Zion are proud and walk with heads held high and seductive eyes , and go along with mincing steps and tinkle the bangles on their feet ,
» Jehovah will cause sores to appear on the heads of the women of Zion . Jehovah will make their foreheads bare . «
On that day Jehovah will take away their fine things : jingling anklets , headbands , crescent-shaped necklaces ,
pendants , bracelets , scarves ,
hats , ankle bracelets , blouses , perfume boxes , charms ,
signet rings , nose rings ,
fine robes , coats , shawls , purses ,
mirrors , underwear , headdresses , and veils .
Instead of the smell of perfume , there will be the smell of decay . They will wear ropes instead of belts . They will have baldheads instead of beautiful hair . They will wear sackcloth instead of expensive clothes . Their beauty will be scarred with brand marks .
Your men will be killed by the sword , in war .
Her Zion’s gates will lament and mourn and she will sit on the ground deserted .
Seven women will grab one man and say : » We will eat our own food and provide our own clothes . Just let us marry you and be called by your name . Take away our disgrace . «
In that day the Branch of Jehovah will be beautiful and glorious . And the fruit of the earth will be the delight pride joy and the adornment of the survivors of Israel .
It will come about that he who is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy along with everyone who is recorded among the living in Jerusalem .
Jehovah will wash away the filth of the daughters women of Zion and purge the bloodshed of Jerusalem from her midst , by the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning .
Then Jehovah will create over the entire area of Mount Zion and over her assemblies a cloud by day , even smoke , and the brightness of a flaming fire by night . A canopy shelter will be over all as the glory honor .
There will be a shelter to give shade from the heat by day , and refuge and protection from the storm and the rain .
Let me sing to my loved one a song of my beloved concerning his vineyard : My loved one had a vineyard on a fertile hill .
He dug the soil all around and removed its stones . He planted it with the choicest vine . And he built a tower in the middle of it and also hewed out a wine vat in it . Then he expected it to produce good grapes , but it only produced worthless ones .
» Now then , you inhabitants of Jerusalem and Judah , judge between my vineyard and me !
» What more could have been done for my vineyard than what I have already done for it ? When I waited for it to produce good grapes , why did it produce only sour , wild grapes ?
» Here is what I am going to do to my vineyard : I will take away the hedge and break down the wall that protects it . I will let wild animals eat it and trample it down .
» It will turn into a desert , neither pruned nor cultivated . It will be covered with thorns and briars . I will command the clouds not to send rain . «
I am Jehovah of Hosts All Powerful ! Israel is the vineyard , and Judah is the garden I tended with care . I had hoped for honesty and for justice , but dishonesty and cries for mercy were all I found .
Cursed are those who are joining house to house , and putting field to field , till there is no more living-space for any but themselves in all the land !
With my own ears I heard Jehovah of Hosts say : » Many houses will become empty . Large , beautiful houses will be without people to live in them .
» A ten-acre vineyard will produce only six gallons of wine , and two quarts of seed will produce only four quarts of grain . «
How horrible it will be for those who get up early in the morning to look for a drink and who sit up late at night until they are drunk from wine .
At their feasts there are lyres and harps , tambourines and flutes , and wine . Yet , they do not pay attention to what Jehovah is doing or respect what his hands have done .
My people will go into exile because they do not understand what I am doing . Honored men will starve , and common people will be parched with thirst .
That is why the grave's appetite increases . It opens its mouth very wide so that honored people and common people will go down into it . Those who are noisy and joyous will go down into it .
People will be brought down . Everyone will be humiliated and the eyes of arrogant people will be abased humbled .
Jehovah of Hosts shows his greatness by doing what is right . He reveals his holiness by judging his people .
In the ruins of the cities lambs will eat grass and young goats will find pasture .
Woe to those who scatter sin with cords of falsehood and iniquity with a cart rope !
You say : » Let Jehovah hurry up and do what he says he will , so that we can see it . Let Israel's holy God carry out his plans . Let us see what he has in mind . «
You are doomed ! You call evil good and you call good evil . You turn darkness into light and light into darkness . You make what is bitter , sweet , and what is sweet you make bitter .
You are doomed ! You think you are wise . You think you are so very clever .
You are doomed ! Heroes of the wine bottle ! Brave and fearless when it comes to mixing drinks !
You let the guilty go free for a bribe and you keep the innocent from getting justice .
You will go up in flames like straw and hay ! You have rejected the law of the holy God Jehovah the All-Powerful Holy One of Israel . Now your roots will rot , and your blossoms will turn to dust .
You are Jehovah’s people , but you made him terribly angry , and he struck you with his mighty arm . Mountains shook , and dead bodies covered the streets like garbage . Jehovah is still angry . He is ready to strike you again .
Jehovah raises up a flag for the nations far away . With a whistle he signals those at the ends of the earth . Look , they are coming very quickly !
None of them grow tired or stumble . None of them slumber or sleep . The belts on their waists are not loose or their sandal straps broken .
Their arrows are sharpened . All their bows are strung and ready to shoot . Their horses' hoofs are as hard as flint . Their chariot wheels are as quick as the wind .
They roar like a lioness . They growl like a young lion . They growl as they snatch their prey and carry it off to where no one can rescue it .
In that day they will roar over their prey as the sea roars . If they look at the land , they will see only darkness and distress . Thick clouds will darken even the light .
In the year that King Uzziah died , I saw discerned Jehovah seated on a throne , high and exalted . The train of his robe filled the Temple .
Above him were seraphs , each with six wings . With two wings they covered their faces , with two they covered their feet , and with two they were flying .
They called to one another : » Holy , holy , holy is Jehovah of Hosts . All the earth is full of his glory . «
At the sound of their voices the foundations and thresholds trembled and the Temple was filled with smoke .
» Woe to me ! « I cried . » I am ruined ! For I am a man of unclean lips a sinner and I live among a people of unclean filthy lips speech language . My eyes have seen the King , Jehovah of Hosts . «
Then one of the seraphs flew to me with a live coal in his hand . With tongs he seized it from the altar .
He touched my mouth with it and said : » See ! This has touched your lips , your guilt is taken away and your sin forgiven pardoned atoned for . «
I heard the voice of Jehovah . He said : » Whom shall I send ? And who will go for us ? « And I said : » Here I am . Send me ! «
He said : » Go and tell this people : ‘ Hear constantly but do not understand . See constantly but do not perceive . ’
» This people’s heart has become calloused . They hardly hear with their ears , and they have closed their eyes . Otherwise they might see with their eyes , hear with their ears , understand with their hearts , and turn and be healed . « Septuagint
Then I said : » How long , O Jehovah ? And He answered : » Until the cities are laid waste and without inhabitant , until the houses are deserted and the land is utterly desolate .
» Until Jehovah has removed men far away , and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land .
» Even if one out of ten people are left it will be destroyed burned again . When a strong tree or an oak is cut down , a stump is left . The holy seed is the stump . «
In the days of Ahaz son of Jotham son of Uzziah , king of Judah , King Rezin of Aram and King Pekah son of Remaliah of Israel went up to attack Jerusalem , but could not mount an attack against it .
A report was made to the house of David saying : Aram has allied itself with Ephraim . « The heart of Ahaz and the heart of his people shook their courage failed as the trees of the forest shake before the wind .
Jehovah said to Isaiah : » You and your son Shear-ja’shub should go out to meet Ahaz at the end of the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the laundryman’s field Fuller’s Field .
» Say to him : ‘ Be careful , keep calm and do not be afraid . Do not lose heart because of these two smoldering stubs of firewood and because of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and of the son of Remaliah .
» ‘ Aram , Ephraim and Remaliah’s son have plotted your ruin . They say :
» ‘ » Let us invade Judah . Let us tear it apart and divide it among us . Let us make the son of Tabeel king over Judah . «
» ‘ This is what the Lord Jehovah says : » It will not take place ! It will not happen !
» ‘ » Because the head of Aram is Damascus , and the head of Damascus is only Rezin . Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people .
» ‘ » The head of Ephraim is Samaria , and the head of Samaria is only Remaliah’s son . If you do not stand firm in your faith , you will not stand at all . « ’ «
Again Jehovah spoke to Ahaz :
» Ask Jehovah your God for a sign . Ask it in the deepest depths or in the highest heights . «
But Ahaz said : » I will not ask . I will not put Jehovah to the test . «
Isaiah said : » Hear this you house of David ! Is it not enough to try the patience of men ? Will you try the patience of my God also ? «
Therefore Jehovah will give you a sign : The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son , and will call him Immanuel God with us .
He will eat butter and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right .
But before the boy knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right , the land of the two kings you dread will be laid waste .
Jehovah will bring on you and on your people and on the house of your father a time unlike any since Ephraim broke away from Judah . He will bring the king of Assyria upon you .
» In that day Jehovah will whistle for the flies that are at the distant branches of the Nile River in Egypt and for the bees that are in Assyria .
» All of them will come and settle in the deep valleys , in the cracks in the cliffs , on all the thorn bushes , and at all the water holes .
» In that day Jehovah will hire the king of Assyria from beyond the Euphrates River to be a razor to shave the hair on your head , the hair on your legs , and even your beard .
» On that day a person will keep alive a young cow and two sheep .
» They will give so much milk that he will have all he needs . Yes , the few survivors left in the land will have milk and honey to eat .
» When that time comes , the fine vineyards , each with a thousand vines and each worth a thousand pieces of silver , will be overgrown with thorn bushes and briers .
» People will go hunting there with bows and arrows . Yes , the whole country will be full of briers and thorn bushes .
» All the hills where crops were once planted will be so overgrown with thorns that no one will go there . It will be a place where cattle and sheep graze . «
Jehovah said to me : » Take a large writing tablet , and write on it with a pen : Maher Shalal Hash Baz The Looting Will Come Quickly ; the Prey Will Be Easy .
» I will have these dependable witnesses testify : the priest Uriah and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah . «
I slept with the prophetess . She became pregnant and gave birth to a son . Jehovah told me : » Name him Maher Shalal Hash Baz .
» Before the boy knows how to say » Father « or » Mother « the wealth of Damascus and the loot from Samaria will be carried away to the king of Assyria . «
Jehovah spoke to me again , He said :
» These people have rejected the gently flowing water of Shiloah and find joy in Rezin and Remaliah's son .
» That is why Jehovah is going to bring against them the raging and powerful floodwaters of the Euphrates River , that is , the king of Assyria with all his power . It will overflow all its channels and go over all its banks .
» It will sweep through Judah . It will overflow and pass through . It will be neck-high . Its outspread wings will extend over your entire country , O Immanuel . «
Be broken , you people . Be terrified . Listen all you distant parts of the earth . Prepare for battle and be terrified . Prepare for battle and be terrified !
Make plans for battle , but they will never succeed . Give orders , but they will not be carried out , because God is with us !
This is what Jehovah said with his powerful hand on me . He warned me not to follow the ways of these people :
» Do not say that everything these people call a conspiracy is a conspiracy . Do not fear what they fear . Do not let it terrify you !
» Remember that Jehovah of Hosts is holy . He is the one you should respect . He is the one you should reverence venerate exalt . «
He will be a place of safety for you . But he will be a rock that makes people trip and a stumbling block for both kingdoms of Israel . He will be a trap and a snare for those who live in Jerusalem .
Many will stumble over them . They will fall and be broken . They will be trapped and caught .
Tie up the written instructions . Seal the precepts law among my disciples .
I will wait for Jehovah , who hides his face from the descendants of Jacob . I will hope in him .
I am here with the children Jehovah has given me . We are signs and symbols in Israel from Jehovah of Hosts , who lives on Mount Zion .
People will say to you : » Ask for help from the mediums and the fortunetellers , who whisper and mutter . « Should people ask their God for help instead ? Why should they ask the dead to help the living ?
They should go to the teachings and to the written instructions . If people do not speak these words , it is because there is no light truth in them .
They will pass through the land when they are hard-pressed destressed and hungry . When they are hungry , they will be furious . Then they will look up and curse their king and God .
They will look toward the nations of the earth and see only distress and gloom . They will go in anguish and be banished into darkness .
There will be no more gloom for those who were suffering . In the past he humiliated the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali . But in the future he will honor Galilee of the Nations , by the way of the sea , along the Jordan .
The people who walk in darkness ignorance lies have seen a great light truth . A light has dawned on those who live in the land of the shadow of death the grave calamity .
You have enlarged the nation and increased their joy . They rejoice before you as people rejoice at the harvest , as men rejoice when dividing the plunder .
As in the day of Midian’s defeat , you have shattered the yoke of his burdens : the bar across their shoulders , the rod of their oppressor .
Every warrior’s boot used in battle and every garment rolled in blood will be destined for burning , will be fuel for the fire .
For unto us a child is born . Unto us a son is given , and the government will be on his shoulders . He will be called Wonderful , Counselor , Mighty God , Everlasting Father , and Prince of Peace .
Of the increase of his government and peace there will be no end . He will reign on David’s throne and over his kingdom . He will establish and uphold it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever . The zeal of Jehovah of Hosts will accomplish this .
Jehovah has sent a message against to Jacob and it will fall on Israel .
All the people will know it . Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria who say with pride and arrogance of heart :
» The bricks have fallen down , but we will rebuild with cut stones . The fig trees have been cut down , but we will replace them with cedars . «
But Jehovah has strengthened Rezin’s foes against them and has spurred their enemies on .
The Arameans from the east and the Philistines from the west have devoured Israel with open mouth . For all this his anger has not turned away . His hand power is still stretched out extended .
The people did not turn back to him who struck them , or seek Jehovah of Hosts .
So Jehovah will cut off from Israel head and tail , palm branch and reed rush in one day .
Elders and dignitaries are the head , and prophets who teach lies are the tail .
Those who led this people led them astray . And those who were led by them were left in confusion .
That is why Jehovah did not rejoice in their young people , nor show compassion to their orphans and widows . Everyone was godless and an evildoer , and every mouth spoke wickedness foolishness vileness . In all this his anger has not turned away . His hand is stretched out still ready to apply his power .
This wickedness is like a brushfire . It burns not only briers and thorns but the forests , too . It sends up vast clouds of smoke .
The land is blackened by the fury of Jehovah of Hosts . The people are fuel for the fire , and no one spares anyone else .
They slice off what is on the right hand , but they will still be hungry . In the end they will even eat the flesh of their own arms offspring turn upon themselves .
Manasseh will feed on Ephraim , Ephraim will feed on Manasseh , and both will devour Judah . But even then Jehovah’s anger will not be satisfied . His hand is still poised to unleash his power .
How horrible it will be for those who enact unjust laws and who decree oppressive regulations .
They deprive the poor of justice . They take away the rights of the needy among my people . They prey on widows and rob orphans .
What will you do on the day you are called to account for these things , when destruction comes from far away ? Where will you run for help ? Where will you leave your wealth ?
There is nothing left but to crouch among prisoners and to fall with those who are killed . Even after all this , his anger will not disappear . His hand is stretched out he is still ready to use his power .
» How horrible it will be for Assyria ! It is the rod of my anger . My fury is in the staff of the Assyrians' hands .
» I send him against a godless nation . I commission him against the people of my fury to capture booty and to seize plunder , and to trample them down like mud clay in the streets .
» But the Assyrian emperor has his own violent plans in mind . He is determined to destroy many nations .
» He boasts : ‘ Every one of my commanders is a king !
» ‘ Is not Calno like Carchemish ? Is not Hamath like Arpad ? Is not Samaria like Damascus ?
» ‘ As my hand took hold of the kingdoms of the idols , kingdoms whose carved images were greater then those of Jerusalem and Samaria ,
» ‘ As I have done to Samaria and her idols , Shall I not also do to Jerusalem and her idols ? ’
» It will happen when Jehovah has performed all his work on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem . He will say : I will punish the fruit of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria , and the glory of his haughty appearance .
» ‘ The king of Assyria says : By the strength of my hand I have done it . By my wisdom and understanding I have done it ! I am prudent ! Also I have removed the boundaries of the nations . I have robbed their treasuries . I have brought down people like a mighty man !
» ‘ I found the riches of nations as one finds a nest . I gathered the whole world as one gathers abandoned eggs . Not one of them flapped a wing , opened its mouth , or peeped . ’ «
Can an ax attack the person who cuts with it ? Can a saw make itself greater than the person who saws with it ? A rod cannot move the person who lifts it . A wooden stick cannot pick up a person .
That is why the Almighty Jehovah of Hosts will send a degenerative disease against brave men . A flame will be turned into a raging fire under his power .
The Light of Israel will become a fire and his Holy One a flame . It will burn and consume his thorns and his briers in a single day !
It will completely destroy the splendor of his forests and fertile fields , as when a sick man wastes away .
And the remaining trees of his forests will be so few that a child could write them down .
In that day the remnant of Israel , the survivors of the house of Jacob , will no longer rely on the one who defeated them . They will truly rely on Jehovah , the Holy One of Israel .
A remnant of Jacob will return to the Mighty Powerful God . Yes , a remnant will return !
Your people , O Israel , are like the sand of the sea . Yet only a remnant within them will return . Overwhelming and righteous destruction has been decreed .
The Sovereign Lord Jehovah of Hosts , will carry out the complete destruction decreed upon the whole land .
Therefore , this is what the Lord Jehovah of Hosts , declares : » O my people who live in Zion , do not be afraid of the Assyrians . They beat you with a rod and lift up a club against you , as Egypt did .
» Very soon my anger against you will end and my wrath will be directed to their destruction .
» Jehovah of Hosts will stir up enemies against you as when he struck down Midian at the rock of Oreb . His wrath will come by way of the sea , as he did in Egypt .
» In that day your burden will be lifted from your shoulders , their yoke from your neck ; the yoke will be broken because you have grown so fat . «
They enter Aiath and they pass through Migron . They store supplies at Micmash .
They go over the pass and make Geba their camping place for the night . Ramah trembles and Gibeah of Saul flees .
Cry out , O Daughter of Gallim ! Listen and pay attention , O Laishah ! Poor afflicted Anathoth !
Madmenah has fled ; the people of Gebim take cover .
This day they will halt at Nob . They will shake their fist at the mount of the Daughter of Zion , at the hill of Jerusalem .
Behold , the Sovereign Lord Jehovah of Hosts will lop off the boughs with great power . The lofty trees will be cut down ! The tall ones will be brought low .
He will cut down the forest thickets with an ax . Lebanon will fall before the Mighty One .
There must go forth a twig out of the stump of Jesse . A branch sprout shoot descendant from his roots will bear fruit .
The Spirit of Jehovah will rest on him . The spirit of wisdom and understanding , the spirit of counsel and strength , the spirit of knowledge and respect for Jehovah will be his .
He will delight in the reverence of Jehovah . He will not judge by what his eyes see , nor make a decision by what his ears hear .
But with righteousness he will judge the poor , and decide with fairness for the afflicted of the earth . He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth power of his words , and with the spirit breath of his lips he will destroy the wicked .
Righteousness will be the belt around his loins . Faithfulness will be the belt around His waist .
The wolf will dwell with the lamb , and the leopard will lie down with the young goat , and the calf and the young lion and the well-fed animal together . A little boy will lead them .
Also the cow and the bear will graze . Their young will lie down together . And the lion will eat straw like the ox .
The nursing child will play by the hole of the cobra . The weaned child will put his hand on the viper's den .
They will not hurt or destroy in my entire holy mountain . This is because the earth will be full of the knowledge of Jehovah just as the waters cover the sea .
Then in that day the nations will search for and turn to the root of Jesse . He will stand as a signal for the peoples . His resting place will be glorious .
Then it will happen in that day that Jehovah will again recover the second time with his hand the remnant of his people . They will remain , from Assyria , Egypt , Pathros , Cush , Elam , Shinar , Hamath , and from the islands of the sea .
He will lift up a standard for the nations and assemble the outcast ones of Israel . He will gather the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth .
Then the jealousy of Ephraim will depart . Those who harass Judah will be destroyed . Ephraim will not be jealous of Judah , and Judah will not harass Ephraim .
They will swoop down on the slopes of the Philistines on the west . Together they will plunder the sons of the east . They will possess Edom and Moab , and the sons of Ammon will be subject to them .
Jehovah will utterly destroy the tongue of the Sea of Egypt . He will wave his hand , his mighty Spirit , over the Euphrates River . He will strike it into seven streams and make men walk over on dry land .
There will be a highway from Assyria for the remnant of his people who will be left . This will be as it was for Israel when they came up out of the land of Egypt .
In that day you will say : » I will praise you , O Jehovah . Although you were angry with me , your anger has turned away and you have comforted me .
» Truly God is my salvation ! I will trust and not be afraid . Jehovah Jehovah is my strength and my song ! He has become my salvation . «
With joy gladness you will draw water from the wells of salvation .
In that day you will say : » Give thanks to Jehovah , call on his name ; make known among the nations what he has done , and proclaim that his name is exalted .
» Sing to Jehovah , for he has done glorious things . Let this be known to the entire world .
» Shout aloud and sing for joy , people of Zion , for great is the Holy One of Israel among you . «
The pronouncement Isaiah the son of Amoz saw in vision .
» Lift up a standard high on the mountain . Raise your voice to them . Shake the hand so they may enter the doors of the nobles .
» I have commanded my consecrated ones . I have called my mighty warriors . My proud ones are to express my anger , those who rejoice in my majesty excellency .
» Listen ! A sound of tumult on the mountains is like that of many people ! A sound of the uproar of kingdoms and nations gathered together ! Jehovah of Hosts assembles inspects the army for battle .
» They come from a far country , from the extremities of the heavens horizons . Jehovah and his instruments of indignation come to destroy the whole land .
» Shout wail howl for the Day of Jehovah is near ! It will come as destruction from the Almighty .
» All hands will fall impaired weakened . Every man's heart will melt courage will fail .
» They will be terrified ! Pains and anguish will possess them . They will writhe like a woman in labor . They will look at one another in amazement with their faces reddened with excitement aflame .
» Behold ! The Day of Jehovah is coming ! It will be cruel , with fury and burning anger . It will make the land desolation and exterminate the sinners from it .
» The stars of heaven and their constellations will not shine forth their light . The sun will be dark when it rises and the moon will not shine its light .
» I will punish the world for its evil and the wicked for their iniquity . I will also end the arrogance of the proud . I will demean disgrace the arrogance of tyranny .
» I will make mortal man harder to find than pure gold and mankind than the gold of Ophir .
» Therefore I will make the heavens tremble . The earth will shake from its place at the fury of Jehovah of Hosts in the day of his burning anger .
» They will each turn to his own people , and each one escape to his own land just like a hunted gazelle , or like sheep without a shepherd .
» All who are found will be pierced through . All who are captured will fall by the sword .
» Their infant children will be dashed to pieces before their eyes . Their houses will be plundered and their wives raped .
» I will stir up the Medes against them . They will not value silver or take pleasure in gold .
» And their bows will mow down the young men . They will not even have compassion on the fruit of the womb . Nor will they have compassion on children .
Babylon , the beauty honor glory of kingdoms , the majesty of Chaldean pride , will be overthrew by God like Sodom and Gomorrah .
» It will never be inhabited or lived in from generation to generation ! Nor will the Arab pitch his tent there . Nor will shepherds take their flocks there .
» But desert animals will lie down there . Their houses will be full of owls ! Shaggy goats demons will play there and ostriches will dance there .
» Wild beasts will howl in her fortified towers and jackals in her luxurious temples . Her time also will soon come and her days will not be prolonged . «
Jehovah will have compassion on Jacob and again choose Israel . He will resettle them in their own country . Foreigners will join them and unite with the descendants of Jacob .
People will take them and bring them to their own place . The nation of Israel will possess nations as male and female slaves in Jehovah’s land . They will take their captors captive and rule their oppressors .
When that day comes , Jehovah will give you relief from your pain and suffering , from the hard slavery you were forced to do .
You will mock the king of Babylon with this saying : » How the tyrant has come to an end ! How his attacks have come to an end !
» Jehovah has broken the staff of the wicked , the scepter of rulers .
» They struck the people with fury , with blows that did not stop . They ruled nations in anger , persecuting them without restraint .
» The whole earth rests and is quiet . It breaks out into shouts of joy .
» ‘ Even the cypress trees rejoice over you . The cedars of Lebanon say : ‘ Since you have fallen , no lumberjack has come to attack us . ’
» The grave below wakes up to meet you when you come . It wakes up those who are dead , all who were leaders on earth . It raises all who were kings of the nations from their thrones .
» ‘ All of them will greet you : ‘ You also have become weak like us ! You have become like one of us !
» ‘ Your pride has been brought down to the grave along with the music of your harps . Maggots are spread out like a bed under you , and worms cover you . ’
» O how you have fallen from heaven , you morning star shining one , and son of the dawn ! How you have been cut down to the ground , you who conquered nations !
» ‘ You thought : ‘ I will go up to heaven Mount Zion and set up my throne above God's stars messengers . I will sit on the mountain of meeting far away in the north where the gods assemble .
» ‘ I will go above the top of the clouds . I will be like the Most High . ’
» But you have been brought down to the grave , to the deepest part of the pit .
» ‘ Those who see you stare at you . They look at you closely and say : ‘ Is this the man who made the earth tremble , who shook the kingdoms ,
who made the world like a desert and tore down its cities and did not let his prisoners go home ? ’
All the kings of the nations , all of them , have been buried with honor , each in his own tomb .
However you are thrown out of your tomb like a rejected branch . You are covered with those who were killed in battle . You go down to the stones bottom of the pit like a trampled corpse .
You ruined your country and killed your own people . For that reason , you will not be buried like other kings . None of your evil family will survive .
» Prepare a slaughtering place ! The sons of this king will die because of their ancestors' sins . None of them will ever rule the earth or cover it with cities . «
Jehovah of Hosts declares : » I will attack Babylon and bring it to ruin . I will leave nothing ! There will be no children , no survivors at all . I , Jehovah , have spoken .
» I will turn Babylon into a marsh . Porcupines will live there . I will sweep Babylon with a broom that will sweep everything away . « I , the Sovereign Lord Jehovah have spoken .
Jehovah of Hosts has sworn an oath : » What I have intended devised will happen . What I have determined to do will be done .
» In my land of Israel I will trample them on my mountains . I will free my people from the Assyrian yoke and from the burdens they have had to bear . «
This is my purpose plan advise for the world , and my arm extended power is stretched out to punish the nations .
Jehovah of Hosts is determined to do this . He has stretched out his arm to punish , and no one can stop him .
This message was proclaimed in the year that King Ahaz died :
» The rod that beat you is broken , but you have no reason to be glad . When one snake dies , a worse one comes in its place . A snake's egg hatches a flying dragon .
» Jehovah will be a shepherd to the poor of his people and will let them live in safety . But he will send a terrible famine on you Philistines . It will not leave any of you alive .
» Howl and cry for help , all you Philistine cities ! Be terrified , all of you ! A cloud of dust is coming from the north . It is an army with no cowards in its ranks . «
What then will one answer the messengers that come to us from Philistia ? We will tell them that Jehovah has established Zion and in her the poor and afflicted of his people find refuge .
Surely in a night Ar of Moab is devastated and ruined . Certainly in a night Kir of Moab is devastated and ruined .
They have gone up to the temple and to Dibon , to the high places to weep . Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba . Everyone's head is bald and every beard is cut off .
They have dress themselves with sackcloth in their streets . On their housetops and in their squares everyone is wailing , taken down with tears .
Heshbon and Elealeh cry out . Their voice is heard all the way to Jahaz . Therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud and tremble with fear .
My heart cries out for Moab ! The people have fled to the town of Zoar , and to Eglath Shelishiyah . Some climb the road to Luhith . They weep as they go . Some escape to Horonaim , grieving loudly .
The Brook of Nimrim is dry , the grass beside it has withered , and nothing green is left .
The people go across the Valley of Willows , trying to escape with all their material possessions .
Everywhere at Moab's borders the sound of crying is heard . It is heard at the towns of Eglaim and Beerelim .
Dimon’s waters are full of blood . I will bring still more upon Dimon , a lion upon the fugitives of Moab and upon those who remain in the land .
Send lambs as tribute to the ruler of the land , from Sela , across the desert , to the mountain of the Daughter of Zion .
Like fluttering birds pushed from the nest , so are the women of Moab at the fords of the Arnon River .
» Give us counsel and render a decision . Make your shadow like night at high noon . Hide the fugitives ! Do not betray the refugees .
» Let the Moabite fugitives stay with you . Be their shelter from the destroyer . The oppressor will come to an end . Destruction will cease ! For the aggressor will vanish from the land .
» In love a throne will be established and in faithfulness a man will sit on it . One shall sit upon it in truth and faithfulness . He will be from the tent of David . He will judge and seek justice and speed the cause of righteousness . «
We have heard of the pride of Moab and of his arrogance . We know of his pride , conceit and empty boasting .
The Moabites cry , they cry out together for Moab . Lament and grieve for the men and the raisin cakes of Kir Hareseth .
The fields of Heshbon and the vines of Sibmah wither . The rulers of the nations have trampled down the choicest vines , which once reached Jazer and spread toward the desert . Their shoots spread out and went as far as the sea .
So I weep , as Jazer weeps , for the vines of Sibmah . O Heshbon , O Elealeh , I drench you with tears ! The shouts of joy over your ripened fruit and over your harvests have been stilled .
Joy and gladness are taken away from the orchards . No one sings or shouts in the vineyards ! No one treads out wine at the presses , for I have put an end to the shouting .
That is why my heart mourns for Moab like a harp . I mourn for Kir Hareseth .
When the people of Moab appear at the worship site , they will only wear themselves out . They will come into the holy place to pray , but they will not be able to .
This is the message Jehovah spoke about Moab in the past .
Now Jehovah says : » Moab's honor will be despised within three years . I will count them like workers count the years left of their contracts . In spite of their great number , the survivors will be very few and powerless . «
» Damascus will cease to be a city , and will become a heap of ruins .
» The cities of Aroer three places near Palestine will be deserted forever . They will be places for flocks to lie down , and no one will make them afraid .
» The fortress will disappear from Ephraim , and the kingdom sovereignty from Damascus . The remnant of Aram will be like the glory of the children of Israel , proclaims Jehovah of Hosts .
» Then the glory of Jacob will be brought low , and the fat of his flesh will grow lean riches , strength and glory will diminish .
It will be like reapers gathering the standing grain . Their arms harvest the ears , and as when one gleans the ears of grain in the Valley of Rephaim .
Gleanings will be left in it , as when an olive tree is beaten : two or three berries in the top of the highest bough , four or five on the branches of a fruit tree , declares Jehovah the God of Israel .
On that day people will regard their Maker . Their eyes will look offer respect to the Holy One of Israel .
They will not have regard for the altars , the work of their hands , and they will not look to what their own fingers have made , either the sacred poles Asherim or the altars of incense .
In that day their strong cities of Syria and Israel will be like a forsaken bough and an uppermost branch that they left because of the children of Israel . There will be desolation in the land .
Because you have forgotten the God of your salvation . You have not been mindful of the Rock of your stronghold . Therefore you will plant pleasant plants and set out foreign imported unusual seedlings .
In that day you will make your plant grow . In the morning you will make your seed flourish ; but the harvest will be a heap of ruins in the day of grief and desperate sorrow .
There will be trouble for the multitude of people , because they will roar like the roar of the seas . Woe to the rushing of nations that makes a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters !
The nations will rush like the raging of many waters . But God will rebuke them and they will flee far away . They will be chased like the chaff of the mountains before the wind , like a rolling dust before the whirlwind .
In the evening , sudden terror ! Before the morning , they are gone ! This is the portion of those who loot us , the lot of those who rob us .
Woe to the land of whirring wings which lies beyond the rivers of Ethiopia Cush .
It sends messengers by sea in boats made of reeds that skim over the surface of the water . » Go , swift messengers , to a tall and smooth-skinned people , a people who are feared far and near , a strong and aggressive nation , whose land is divided by rivers . «
Look when someone raises a flag on the mountains . Listen when someone blows a ram's horn , all you inhabitants of the world , you who live on the earth .
Jehovah says this to me : » I will be still and watch from my dwelling place . My presence will be like scorching heat in the sunshine , like heavy dew in the heat of the harvest .
» Before the harvest , when blossoms are gone and grapes are ripening from blossoms , he will cut off the shoots with pruning shears and chop off and take away the spreading branches .
They will all be left for the birds of prey on the mountains and the wild animals . The birds of prey will feed on them in the summer . All the wild animals on earth will feed on them in the winter .
» At that time gifts will be brought to Jehovah of Hosts from a tall and smooth-skinned people , a people who are feared far and near . It will be a strong and aggressive nation , whose land is divided by rivers . They will be brought to Mount Zion , the place where the name of Jehovah of Hosts is . «
Jehovah rides on a swift cloud and is coming to Egypt . The idols of Egypt tremble before him . The hearts of the Egyptians melt their courage fails within them .
» I will stir up Egyptian against Egyptian . Brother will fight against brother , neighbor against neighbor , city against city , kingdom against kingdom .
» The Egyptians will become discouraged . I will bring their plans to nothing . They will consult the idols and the spirits of the dead , the mediums and the spiritists .
» I will hand the Egyptians over to the power of a cruel master , and a fierce king will rule over them . « This is the declaration of Jehovah of Hosts , the Almighty .
The waters of the Nile River will dry up . The riverbed will be parched and dry .
The canals will stink . The streams of Egypt will dwindle and dry up . The reeds and rushes will wither .
The plants rushes along the Nile , at the mouth of the river will wither . Every sown field along the Nile will become parched and blow away to be no more .
The fishermen will groan and lament . All who cast hooks into the Nile and throw nets on the water will be weak and sick .
Those who work with combed flax will despair . The weavers of fine linen and cotton will lose hope .
The workers in cloth will be dejected , and all the wage earners will be sick at heart .
The officials of Zoan are nothing but fools . The wise counselors of Pharaoh give senseless advice . How can you say to Pharaoh : » I am one of the wise men , a disciple of the ancient kings ? «
Where are your wise men now ? Let them show you and make known what Jehovah of Hosts has purposed planned resolved against Egypt .
The officials of Zoan have become fools . The leaders of Memphis Noph are deceived . The cornerstones of her peoples have led Egypt astray .
Jehovah has poured into them a spirit of dizziness . They make Egypt stagger in all that she does , as a drunkard staggers around in his vomit .
There is nothing Egypt can do head or tail , palm branch or reed .
A time is coming when the people of Egypt will be as timid as women . They will tremble in terror when they see that Jehovah of Hosts has stretched out his hand extended His power to punish them .
The people of Egypt will be terrified of Judah every time they are reminded of the fate that Jehovah of Hosts has prepared for them .
When that time comes , the Hebrew language will be spoken in five Egyptian cities . The people there will take their oaths in the name of Jehovah of Hosts . One of the cities will be called : » City of Destruction . «
When that time comes , there will be an altar to Jehovah in the middle of the land of Egypt and a stone pillar dedicated to him at the Egyptian border .
They will be a sign of the presence of Jehovah of Hosts in Egypt . When the people there are oppressed and call out to Jehovah for help , he will send someone to rescue them .
Jehovah will make himself known to Egypt , and the Egyptians will know Jehovah in that day . They will even worship with sacrifice and offering , and will make a vow to Jehovah and perform it .
Jehovah will strike Egypt , striking but healing ; so they will turn to Jehovah , and he will respond to them and will heal them .
In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria . The Assyrians will come to Egypt and the Egyptians to Assyria , and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians .
In that day Israel will be the third party with Egypt and Assyria , a blessing in the midst of the earth .
Jehovah of Hosts has blessed , saying : Blessed is Egypt my people , and Assyria the work of my hands , and Israel my inheritance .
The supreme commander , sent by Sargon king of Assyria , fought against Ashdod and captured it .
At that time Jehovah spoke through Isaiah son of Amoz . He said to him : » Take off the sackcloth from your body and the sandals from your feet . « He did this and went around stripped and barefoot .
Jehovah said : » Just as my servant Isaiah has gone stripped and barefoot for three years , as a sign and portent against Egypt and Cush ,
so the king of Assyria will lead away stripped and barefoot the Egyptian captives and Cushite exiles , young and old , with buttocks bared to Egypt’s shame .
» Those who trusted in Cush and boasted in Egypt will be afraid and put to shame .
» That day the people who live on this coast will say : ‘ See what has happened to those we relied on , those we fled to for help and deliverance from the king of Assyria ! How then can we escape ? « ’
Like a whirlwind sweeping across the desert , disaster will come from a terrifying land .
I have seen a vision of cruel events , a vision of betrayal and destruction . Army of Elam , attack ! Army of Media , lay siege to the cities ! God will put an end to the suffering that Babylon has caused .
What I saw and heard in the vision has filled me with terror and pain . My hips are full of pain and convulsions like that of a woman in labor .
My innermost being reels , horror overwhelms me . The twilight I longed for has been turned for me into trembling .
They set the table , they spread out the cloth , they eat , they drink ; Rise up , captains , oil the shields ,
For this is what Jehovah says to me : » Go , station the lookout , and let him report what he sees .
» When he sees riders , horsemen in pairs , a train of donkeys , a train of camels , Let him pay close attention , very close attention . «
The watchman called out from the tower : » Sir , I stand on the watchtower every day . Every night , I stand guard at my post .
» Look ! Here come chariots and horsemen in pairs . Then he said : ‘ Babylon has fallen ! She has fallen ! All the idols they worship lie shattered on the ground . ’ «
You , my people , have been threshed and winnowed . I make known to you what I heard from Jehovah of Hosts , the God of Israel .
This is the divine REVELATION ABOUT EDOM . He calls to me from Seir : » Watchman , what of the night ? How much of the night is left ? Watchman , what of the night ? «
The watchman replies : » Morning is coming , but also the night . If you would ask , then ask ; and come back yet again . «
You caravans of Dedanites , who camp in the thickets of Arabia ,
bring water for the thirsty . You who live in Tema , bring food for the fugitives .
They flee from the sword , from the drawn sword , from the bent bow and from the heat of battle .
This is what Jehovah says to me : » Within one year , as a servant bound by contract would count it , all the pomp of Kedar will come to an end .
» The survivors of the bowmen , the warriors of Kedar , will be few . « Jehovah , the God of Israel , has spoken !
What troubles you now that you have all gone up on the roof ?
You are a town full of commotion , a city of tumult and revelry . The sword did not kill your slain , nor did they die in battle .
All your leaders have fled together . They have been captured without using the bow . All you who were caught were taken prisoner together . You fled while the enemy was still far away .
I said : » Turn away from me . Let me weep bitterly . Do not try to console me over the destruction of my people . «
The Lord Jehovah of Hosts has a day of tumult , trampling and terror in the Valley of Vision . It is a day of battering down walls and of crying out to the mountains .
Elam takes up the quiver , with her charioteers and horses . Kir uncovers the shield .
Your choicest valleys are full of chariots , and horsemen are posted at the city gates .
The defenses of Judah are stripped away . And you looked in that day to the weapons in the house of the forest .
You saw that the City of David had many breaches in its defenses . You stored up water in the lower pool .
You counted the houses of Jerusalem . Then you broke down the houses to fortify the wall .
You made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool . But you did not look to him who did it , or have regard for him who planned it long ago .
In that day Jehovah God of Hosts called to weeping and mourning , to baldness and putting on sackcloth .
Instead there was joy and festivity , killing oxen and slaughtering sheep , eating meat and drinking wine . » Let us eat and drink , for tomorrow we die . «
Jehovah of Hosts has disclosed himself in my ears : » Surely this iniquity will not be forgiven you until you die , « says Jehovah of Hosts .
Jehovah of Hosts says : » Go to this steward , to Shebna , who is master of the household , and say to him :
» ‘ What right do you have here ? Who are your relatives here that you have cut out a tomb here for yourself , cutting a tomb on the height , and carving a habitation for yourself in the rock ?
» ‘ Jehovah will violently throw you away , O mighty man . He will surely seize you .
» ‘ He will surely turn violently and toss you like a ball into a large country ! There you shall die , and there your glorious chariots will be the shame of your master’s house . ’
» ‘ I will drive you out of your office . He will pull you down from your position .
» ‘ Then in that day I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah .
» ‘ I will clothe him with your robe and strengthen him with your belt . I will commit your responsibility into his hand . He will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah .
» ‘ I will lay the key of the house of David on his shoulder . He will open , and no one will shut and he will shut , and no one will open .
» ‘ I will fasten him as a peg in a secure place . He will become a glorious throne to his father’s house .
» ‘ They will hang all the glory of his father’s house on him , the offspring and the posterity , all vessels of small quantity , from the cups to all the pitchers .
» ‘ Jehovah of Hosts says : ‘ In that day the peg that is fastened in the secure place will be removed and be cut down and fall . The load that was on it will be destroyed . ’ « Jehovah has spoken .
Wail , O ships of Tarshish ! For Tyre is destroyed and left without house or harbor . From the land of Cyprus Kittim word has come to them .
Be silent , you people of the island and you merchants of Sidon , whom the seafarers have enriched .
On the great waters came the grain of the Shihor . The harvest of the Nile River was the revenue of Tyre , and she became the marketplace of the nations .
Be ashamed , O Sidon , and you , O fortress of the sea , for the sea has spoken : I have neither been in labor nor given birth . I have neither reared sons nor brought up daughters .
When word arrives at Egypt , they will be in anguish at the report from Tyre .
Crossover to Tarshish and cry you people of the island .
Is this your exultant city founded in antiquity ? Is this the city that sent its people to settle in distant lands ?
Who planned such a thing against Tyre , the city that produced kings ? Its merchants are princes . Its traders are among the honored people of the world .
Jehovah of Hosts planned this in order to dishonor all arrogant people and to humiliate all the honored people of the world .
Travel through your country like the Nile , people of Tarshish . You no longer have a harbor .
Jehovah has stretched his hand over the sea to shake kingdoms . He has commanded that Canaan's fortifications be destroyed .
He said : » You will exult no more , O crushed virgin daughter of Sidon . Arise , pass over to Cyprus ; even there you will find no rest . «
Look at the land of the Chaldeans . This is the people that were not . Assyria appointed it for desert creatures . They erected their siege towers and they stripped its palaces . They made it a ruin !
Cry out O ships of Tarshish , for your stronghold is destroyed .
Now in that day Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years like the lifespan of one king . At the end of seventy years it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the prostitute :
» Take harp and walk about the city , O forgotten prostitute . Pluck the strings skillfully ; sing many songs , that you may be remembered . «
It will come about at the end of seventy years that Jehovah will visit Tyre . Then she will go back to her prostitute’s wages and will play the wanton woman with all the kingdoms on the face of the earth .
The money she earns by commerce will be dedicated to Jehovah . She will not store it away , but those who worship Jehovah will use her money to buy the food and the clothing they need .
Jehovah lays the earth waste , annihilates it , disfigures its surface and scatters its inhabitants .
The people will be like the one officiating , the servant like his master , the maid like her mistress , the buyer like the seller , the lender like the borrower , the creditor like the debtor .
The earth will be completely uninhabitable and totally plundered . Jehovah has spoken this word .
The earth mourns and fades away , the world fades and withers , the exalted people of the earth mourn .
The inhabitants of the earth pollute the earth . They transgress laws and violate statutes . They break the everlasting covenant .
A curse devours the earth , and those who live in it are found guilty . Therefore , those living on the earth are burned , and few men are left .
The new wine mourns , the vine decays and the merry-hearted sigh .
The joyful sound of tambourines ceases . The noise of revelers and the delight of the harp cease .
They no longer drink wine with a song . The beverage is bitter to its drinkers .
The ruined city lies desolate . The entrance to every house is barred and none may enter .
In the streets they cry out for wine . Joy turns to gloom and rejoicing is banished from the earth .
The city is left in ruins ; its gate is battered to pieces .
So will it be on the earth and among the nations , as when an olive tree is beaten , or as when gleanings are left after the grape harvest .
They raise their voices and shout for joy . From the west they acclaim Jehovah’s majesty .
Therefore in the east give glory to Jehovah . Exalt the name of Jehovah the God of Israel , in the islands of the sea .
Listen to them as they sing to Jehovah from the ends of the earth : » Glory and praise to the righteous one ! « But I say : » My heart is heavy with grief . I am discouraged , for evil still prevails , and treachery is everywhere . «
Terror and traps and snares will be your lot , you people of the earth .
Those who flee in terror will fall into a trap , and those who escape the trap will step into a snare . Destruction falls on you from the heavens . The world is shaken beneath you .
The earth is broken and destroyed and it is split into pieces . The earth is shaken violently .
The earth reels to and fro like a drunkard and it quakes like a shack in the wind . Its transgression is heavy upon it , and it will fall , never to rise again .
That day Jehovah will punish the host of heaven on high and the kings of the earth below .
They will be gathered like prisoners in the dungeon tower . They will be confined in prison and after many days they will be punished .
Then the moon will be abashed and the sun ashamed , For Jehovah of Hosts will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem , And his glory will be before his elders .
O Jehovah , you are my God . I will exalt you and I will praise your name ! You have done wonderful things with plans formed of old . You are faithful and true .
You have made the city a heap , the mighty city a ruin . The palace of aliens is a city no more . It will never be rebuilt .
Therefore strong peoples will glorify you . Cities of ruthless nations will fear you .
You have been a refuge to the poor , a refuge to the needy in their distress , a shelter from the rainstorm and a shade from the heat . When the blast of the ruthless was like a winter rainstorm ,
the noise of strangers like heat in a dry place , you subdued the heat with the shade of clouds ; the song of the ruthless was stilled .
On this mountain Jehovah of Hosts will make a feast of rich food for all peoples , a feast of well-aged wines , of rich food filled with marrow , of well-aged wines strained clear of dregs .
On this mountain He will destroy the shroud that is cast over all peoples , the sheet that is spread over all nations .
He will swallow up death forever ! The Sovereign Lord Jehovah will wipe away the tears from all faces . He will take away the disgrace of His people from the earth . Jehovah has spoken !
On that day his people will say : » This is our God ! We have waited for Him and now He will save us . This is Jehovah . We have waited for Him . Let us rejoice and be glad because He will save us . «
Jehovah’s power will be on this mountain . Moab will be trampled beneath him like straw that is trampled in a pile of manure .
The Moabites will stretch out their hands in the manure like swimmers who stretch out their hands to swim . Jehovah will humble those arrogant people despite the movements of their hands .
He will bring down Moab's high-fortified walls , level them , and throw them into the dust on the ground .
» We have a strong city . God makes salvation its walls and ramparts . «
» Open the gates that the righteous nation may enter , the nation that preserves truth .
You will keep the steadfast mind in perfect peace , because he trusts hopes in you .
» Trust in Jehovah forever , for Jah , Jehovah , is the Rock eternal .
» He humbles those who dwell on high , he lays the lofty inaccessible city low ; he levels it to the ground and casts it down to the dust .
» Feet trample it down , the feet of the depressed , the footsteps of the poor needy . «
The path of the righteous is level . O upright One , you make the way of the righteous smooth .
Yes , Jehovah , walking in the way of your Laws , we wait for you . Your name and your fame are the desire of our hearts .
I yearn for you in the night . In the morning I long for you with all my being . When your judgments come upon the earth , the people of the world learn righteousness .
Grace favor is shown to the wicked , but they do not learn righteousness . In a land of uprightness they go on doing evil and do not regard the majesty of Jehovah .
O Jehovah , your hand is lifted high , but they do not see it . Let them see your zeal for your people and be put to shame . Let the fire reserved for your enemies consume them .
Jehovah , you establish peace for us . All that we have accomplished you have done for us .
O Jehovah , our God , other lords besides you have ruled over us , but your name alone do we honor .
They are now dead and they live no more . The deceased do not rise . You punished them and brought them to ruin . You wiped out all memory memorial commemoration of them .
You have enlarged the nation , O Jehovah ; you have enlarged the nation . You have gained glory for yourself . You have extended all the borders of the land .
Jehovah , they came to you in their distress . When you disciplined them , they could barely whisper a prayer .
Like a woman with child and about to give birth struggles and cries out in her pain , so were we in your presence , O Jehovah .
We were with child , we writhed in pain , but we gave birth to wind . We have not brought salvation to the earth . We have not given birth to people of the world .
But your dead will live . Their bodies will rise . You , who dwell in the dust , wake up and shout for joy . Your dew is like the dew of the morning ; the earth will give birth to her dead .
Go , my people , enter your rooms and shut the doors behind you . Hide yourselves for a little while until his rage has passed by .
Behold ! Jehovah is coming out of his dwelling to punish the people of the earth for their sins . The earth will disclose reveal the bloodshed upon her . She will conceal her slain no longer .
In that day Jehovah will punish with his sword , his fierce , great and powerful sword . He will slay Leviathan the fleeing , coiling serpent , the monster of the sea .
In that day sing about a fruitful vineyard :
» I , Jehovah , watch over it . I water it continually . I guard it day and night so that no one may harm it .
» I am not angry . If only there were briers and thorns confronting me ! I would march against them in battle . I would set them all on fire .
» Let them come to me for refuge . Let them make peace with me , yes , let them make peace with me . «
In days to come Jacob will take root , Israel will bud and blossom and fill the entire world with fruit .
Has Jehovah struck her as he struck down those who struck her ? Has she been killed as those were killed who killed her ?
By warfare and exile you contend with her . With his fierce blast he drives her out , as on a day the east wind blows .
By this Jacob’s guilt will be atoned for , and this will be the full fruitage of the removal of his sin . When he makes all the altar stones to be like chalk stones crushed to pieces , no Asherah poles or incense altars will be left standing .
The fortified city stands desolate , abandoned settlements , forsaken like the desert . There the calves will graze , there they lie down ; they strip its branches bare .
When its twigs are dry , they are broken off and women come and make fires with them . For they have no understanding discernment . Their Maker has no compassion on them , and their Creator shows them no favor .
In that day Jehovah will thresh from the flowing Euphrates River to the Wadi streambed of Egypt . You , O Israelites , will be gathered up one by one .
A great trumpet will sound . Those who were perishing in Assyria and those who were exiled in Egypt will come and worship Jehovah on the holy mountain in Jerusalem .
Woe to the proud drunks who wear the crown of Ephraim for it is doomed ! Its glory is fading like the crowns of flowers on their heads . They are at the entrance of a fertile valley . They are drunk from wine .
Behold , Jehovah has a strong and mighty one Assyria . He will cast down to the earth with military power . It will be like a destructive thunderstorm with hail and a mighty flood of water .
The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim shall be trodden under foot .
The fading flower of his glorious beauty is found at the head of the fertile valley . He looks at the first-ripe fig before the summer . He picks it with his hand and eats it .
Jehovah of armies will then become a crown of glory and beauty to the remnant of his people .
He will be a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment , a source of strength to those who repel the attack at the gate .
These also stagger from wine and reel from beer . Priests and prophets stagger from beer and are befuddled with wine . They reel from beer . They stagger when seeing visions . They stumble when rendering decisions .
The tables are covered with vomit and there is no spot without filth .
» Who is he is trying to teach ? To whom is he explaining his message ? To children weaned from their milk , to those just taken from the breast ?
» For precept must be upon precept , precept upon precept , line upon line , line upon line , here a little , there a little . «
With stammering lips and another tongue he will speak to this people .
He said : » This is the rest with which you may cause the weary to rest , and , this is the refreshing . « Yet they would not listen .
But the word of Jehovah to them was : » Precept upon precept , precept upon precept , line upon line , line upon line , here a little , there a little , « that they might go and fall backward , and be broken and snared and caught .
Therefore hear the word of Jehovah , you scornful men , who rule this people who are in Jerusalem ,
Because you have said : » We have made a covenant with death , and with the grave we are in agreement . When the overflowing scourge passes through , it will not come to us , for we have made lies our refuge . We have hidden under falsehood ! «
Therefore this is what The Sovereign Lord Jehovah says : » Behold , I lay in Zion a stone for a foundation . It is a tried stone , a precious cornerstone , a sure foundation ; whoever believes will not act hastily .
» I will make justice the measuring line , and righteousness the plummet . The hail will sweep away the refuge of lies , and the waters will overflow the hiding place .
» Your covenant with death will be annulled . Your agreement with the grave will not stand when the overflowing scourge passes through . Then you will be trampled down by it .
» As often as it passes through it will take you . Morning by morning it will pass over , and by day and by night . It will be a terror just to understand the report . «
The bed is too short on which to stretch out , and the cover so narrow that one cannot wrap himself in it .
Jehovah will rise up as at Mount Perazim . He will be angry as in the Valley of Gibeon . That he may do his work , his awesome work , and bring to pass his act , his unusual act .
Do not be scoffers , lest your bonds be made strong . For I have heard from the Sovereign Lord Jehovah of Hosts that destruction is determined decreed upon the whole earth .
Give ear and hear my voice . Listen and hear my speech .
Does the plowman keep plowing all day in order to sow seed ? Does he keep turning his soil and breaking the clods ?
When he has leveled its surface , does he not sow the black cummin and scatter the cummin , plant the wheat in rows , the barley in the appointed place , and the spelt in its place ?
He instructs him in right judgment and his God teaches him .
The black cummin is not threshed with a threshing sledge , nor is a cartwheel rolled over the cummin . But the black cummin is beaten out with a stick , and the cummin with a rod .
Bread flour must be ground . Therefore he does not thresh it forever , break it with his cartwheel , or crush it with his horsemen .
This also comes from Jehovah of Hosts . He is wonderful in counsel and excellent in guidance .
» You will have trouble Ariel . The years go by , year after year in Ariel the city where David camped ! Jerusalem You celebrate your festivals on schedule .
» I will still make you suffer Ariel . Your people will cry and mourn when I make you like the lion of God , Jerusalem . Ariel is symbolic name for Jerusalem .
» I will surround you with a military blockade and attack you from all sides .
» From deep in the earth , you will call out for help . Your voice will sound like a mumble indistinct voice from out of the dust . It will be faint like a whisper .
» Your cruel enemies will be swept away like dust in a windstorm . It will be sudden and unexpected like chaff in the wind .
» Jehovah of Hosts will visit you with a thundering earthquake . A huge whirlwind will bring loud noise and a devouring fire . «
The multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel Jerusalem will be like a bad dream , a vision in the night . Many will fight against her and bring distress to her .
It will be like a hungry man who dreams that he eats . But when he awakes he is empty and still hungry ! It will also be like a thirsty man who dreams that he drinks . When he awakes he is thirsty and weak and hungry . The multitude of nations that fight against Mount Zion will be like this .
Stand still and wonder . Refuse to see and be blind . Get drunk and stagger , but not from wine .
Jehovah has made you drowsy . He shut your eyes in a deep sleep you prophets and visionaries . He overwhelmed your leaders .
His message is like a sealed book to you . You say to someone read this out loud . And they respond , » We cannot read it , because it is sealed . «
The illiterate say : » We cannot read it because we do not know how to read . «
» These people praise me with their words , « said Jehovah , » but they never draw near to me in their hearts deepest thoughts . Their reverence for me comes from the repetitious tradition of men .
» I will do things that shock and amaze them . I will destroy the wisdom of those who claim to know and understand discern . «
You are in for trouble , if you try to hide your plans from Jehovah ! You think what you do in the dark cannot be seen . So you ask : » Who sees us , who knows us ? «
You have it all backwards . A clay dish does not say to the potter , » You did not make me . « And should the one made say to the maker , » You do not understand ? «
Soon the forest of Lebanon will become a fertile field thick with trees .
The deaf will be able to hear the words of the book read to them . The blind will be freed from gloom and darkness .
The meek , the poor , and the needy will celebrate and shout because of Jehovah , the Holy One of Israel .
All who are cruel and arrogant will be extinguished . Those who live by crime will be removed .
God will destroy those who slander others . He will destroy those who prevent the punishment of criminals and those who tell lies to keep honest people from getting justice .
Jehovah said to the house of Jacob : » I am the God of Israel , who rescued Abraham from trouble . My people will not be disgraced any longer . You will no longer be filled with shame .
» When you see the children that I will give you , then you will acknowledge and sanctify my name . I am the Holy God of Israel ! You will honor me and stand in awe of me .
» People who stray will learn to understand . Those who always grumble will be glad to be taught . «
» Suffer you unwilling children , « says Jehovah . » You pursue a purpose that is not mine . You make a covenant sacrifice without my Spirit . You add sin to sin .
» You go to Egypt for help without asking for my advice . You want Egypt to protect you . You put your trust in Egypt's military might .
» The safety of Pharaoh will be your shame and the shelter in the shadow of Egypt , your humiliation .
» Their princes are at Zoan and their ambassadors arrive at Hanes .
» Everyone will be ashamed because of a people who cannot help them . They cannot help . They can only offer shame and reproach . «
THE PROPHESY ABOUT THE BEASTS OF THE NEGEV southern land : The Negev is a land of distress and anguish . Lions and lionesses live there . Vipers and poisonous snakes live there . They carry their riches on the backs of young donkeys and their treasures on the humps of camels to a nation that cannot help them .
Egypt's help is completely useless . That is why I call her : » Rahab , who sits still . « defamatory word for Egypt negative connotation
Write this on a tablet for them , and inscribe it in a book so that it will be there in the future as a permanent witness .
These people are rebellious and deceitful children . They refuse to listen to Jehovah’s Law .
They say to the seers : » Do not see the future . « They say to those who have visions : ‘ Do not have visions that tell us what is right . Tell us what we want to hear . Prophesy illusions .
» ‘ Get out of our way ! Stop blocking our path ! Get the Holy One of Israel out of our sight . ’ «
This is what the Holy One of Israel says : » You have rejected this warning , trusted oppression and deceit , and you leaned upon them for support .
» For that reason your sin will be like a high wall with a bulging crack , ready to fall . All of a sudden it will fall .
» It will break like pottery . It will be smashed . Nothing will be left of it . No piece will be big enough to carry live coals from a fireplace or to dip water from a reservoir . «
The Lord Jehovah , the Holy One of Israel , says : » Return to me and be saved . You can have rest . You can be strong by being quiet and by trusting me . « But you do not want that !
You have said : » No , we will flee on horses . « So you flee . You added : » We will ride on fast horses . « So those who chase you will also be fast .
One thousand people will flee when one person threatens them . You will flee when five threaten you . Then you will be left alone like a flagpole on top of a mountain , like a signpost on a hill .
Jehovah is waiting to be kind to you . He rises to have compassion on you . Jehovah is a God of justice . Blessed are all those who wait for him .
You will live in Zion , in Jerusalem . You will not cry anymore . Jehovah will certainly have pity on you when you cry for help . As soon as he hears you , he will answer you .
Jehovah may give you troubles and hardships . But your Teacher Grand Instructor will no longer be hidden from you . You will see your Teacher with your own eyes .
You will hear a voice behind you say : » This is the way . Walk in it , « whether it turns to the right or to the left .
Then you will dishonor your silver-plated idols and your gold-covered statues . You will throw them away like clothing ruined by stains . You will say to them : » Get out ! «
Jehovah will give you rain for the seed that you plant in the ground , and the food that the ground provides will be rich and nourishing . When that day comes , your cattle will graze in large pastures .
The cattle and the donkeys that work the soil will eat a mixture of food that has been winnowed with forks and shovels .
Brooks and streams will be on every lofty mountain and every high hill . When the day of the great slaughter comes , towers will fall .
Then the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun . The light of the sun will be seven times as strong , like the light of seven days . When that day comes , Jehovah will bandage his people's injuries and heal the wounds he inflicted .
The name of Jehovah is going to come from far away . His anger is burning . His burden is heavy . His lips are filled with fury . His tongue is like a devouring flame .
His breath is like an overflowing stream . It raises neck high and sifts the nations with a sieve of destruction . It places a bit in the mouths of the people to lead them astray .
You will sing a song like the song you sing on a festival night . Your hearts will be happy like someone going out with a flute on the way to Jehovah’s mountain , to the rock of Israel .
Jehovah will make his majestic voice heard . He will come with all his might , with furious anger , with firestorms , windstorms , rainstorms , and hailstones .
The people of Assyria will be shattered at the sound of Jehovah’s voice . He will strike them with his rod .
To the sound of tambourines and lyres , Jehovah will pound on them . He will fight them in battle , swinging his fists displaying his power .
Topheth was prepared long ago . It was made ready for the king . It was made deep and wide and piled high with plenty of burning logs . Jehovah’s breath will be like a flood of burning sulfur , setting it on fire .
How horrible it will be for those who go to Egypt for help ! Cursed are those who rely on very strong warhorses , who depend on many chariots . They do not look to the Holy One of Israel . They do not seek Jehovah .
He is wise and can bring about disaster . He does not take back his words . He rises against wicked people and against those who help troublemakers .
The Egyptians are humans , not God . Their horses are flesh and blood , not spirit . Jehovah will stretch out his powerful hand extend his power . The one who gives help will stumble . The one who receives help will fall . Both will die together .
This is what Jehovah said to me : » A lion , even a young lion , growls over its prey when a crowd of shepherds is called to fight it . It is not frightened by their voices or disturbed by the noise they make . So Jehovah of Hosts will come to fight for Mount Zion and on its hill .
» Jehovah of Hosts will defend Jerusalem like a hovering bird . He will defend it and rescue it . He will pass over it and protect it . «
Return you people of Israel , return to the one whom you have so violently rebelled against .
When that day comes , all of you will reject the worthless gods of silver and gold , the idols that your sinful hands have made .
Then Assyrians will be killed with a sword not made by human hands . The swords not made by human hands will destroy them . They will flee from battle , and their young men will be made to do forced labor .
» In terror they will run to their stronghold , and their officers will be frightened at the sight of the battle flag . « Jehovah declares this . His fire light is in Zion and his furnace is in Jerusalem .
Some day there will be a king who rules with integrity , and national leaders who govern with righteousness . Princes will rule for the sake of justice .
Each of them will be like a shelter from the wind and a place to hide from storms . They will be like streams flowing in a desert , like the shadow of a giant rock in a barren land .
Their eyes and ears will be open to the needs of the people .
They will not be impatient any longer , but they will act with understanding and will pay attention to the needs of the people .
No one will think that a fool is honorable or say that a scoundrel is honest .
A fool speaks foolishly and thinks up evil things to do . He promotes wickedness and what he says insults Jehovah . He never feeds the hungry or gives thirsty people anything to drink .
As for a rogue , his weapons are evil . He devises wicked schemes to destroy the afflicted with slander , even though the needy one speaks what is right .
But the noble man devises noble plans . He stands firm for what is honorable .
Rise up , you women who are at ease . Hear my voice and pay attention to my word , you complacent daughters .
Within a year and some days you will be troubled , O complacent women for the vintage is ended , the fruit gathering will not happen .
Tremble you women who are at ease . Be troubled you complacent ones . Undress and put sackcloth on your waist ,
Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields , for the fruitful vine ,
For the land of my people where thorns and briars will grow for they are on the delightful houses and the exultant city .
Because the palace has been abandoned , the populated city forsaken . Hill and watchtower have become caves forever . They will be a delight for wild donkeys , a pasture for flocks .
The Spirit will be poured out upon us from on high . Then the wilderness will be turned into a fertile field , and the fertile field will be considered a forest .
Then justice will live in the wilderness , and righteousness will be at home in the fertile field .
An act of righteousness will bring about peace and security forever .
My people will live in a peaceful place , in safe homes and quiet places of rest .
The forest will be flattened because of hail , and the city will be completely leveled .
Blessed are those who plant beside every stream and those who let cattle and donkeys roam freely .
Woe to you who destroy for you have not been destroyed ! Woe to you who betray for you who have not been betrayed ! When you stop destroying you will be destroyed ; when you stop betraying you will be betrayed .
Jehovah , be gracious to us ; we long for you . Be our strength every morning , our salvation in time of distress .
When you make a sound the peoples flee . When you rise up , the nations scatter .
Your plunder , O nations , is harvested like young devouring locusts ; like a swarm of cockroaches men pounce on it .
Jehovah is exalted , for he dwells on high . He will fill Zion with justice and righteousness .
He will be the sure foundation for your times , a rich store of salvation and wisdom and knowledge . Respect for Jehovah is the key to this treasure .
Their brave men cry aloud in the streets ; the messengers ambassadors of peace weep bitterly .
The highways are deserted , no travelers are on the roads . The treaty is broken and its witnesses are despised . No one is respected .
The land dries up and wastes away . Lebanon is ashamed and withers . Sharon is like a desert plain . Bashan and Carmel drop their leaves .
» Now I will arise , « says Jehovah . » Now I will be exalted and lifted up .
» You conceive chaff and you give birth to straw . Your strength will be in vain . Fire will consume you .
» The peoples will be burned as if to lime . Like thorn bushes they will be set ablaze .
» You who are far away hear what I have done . You who are near will acknowledge comprehend recognize my power ! «
The sinners in Zion are terrified . The godless tremble . Who of us can dwell with the consuming fire ? Who of us can dwell with long lasting fire ?
He who walks righteously and speaks what is right , who rejects gain from extortion and keeps his hand from accepting bribes , who stops his ears against plots of murder and shuts his eyes against contemplating evil .
This man will dwell on the heights . His refuge will be the mountain fortress . His bread will be supplied , and he will have water .
Your eyes will see the king in his beauty and view a land that stretches afar .
In your thoughts you will ponder the former terror : » Where is that chief officer ? Where is the one who took the revenue ? Where is the officer in charge of the towers ? «
You will see those arrogant people no more , those people of an obscure speech , with their strange , incomprehensible tongue .
Look upon Zion , the city of our festivals . Your eyes will see Jerusalem , a peaceful abode , a tent that will not be moved . Its stakes will never be pulled up , nor any of its ropes broken .
Jehovah will be the Almighty One Powerful One Excellent One . It will be like a place of broad rivers and streams . No galley with oars will ride them , no mighty ship will sail them .
Jehovah is our Judge . Jehovah is our Lawgiver . Jehovah is our King ! He will save us .
Your rigging hangs loose . The mast is not held secure and the sail is not spread . Then an abundance of spoils will be divided and even the lame will carry off plunder .
No one living in Zion will say : » I am sick . « The sins of those who dwell there will be forgiven .
Draw near , people of all nations ! Gather around and listen . Let the whole earth and everyone living on it come here and pay attention .
JEHOVAH IS ANGRY WITH ALL THE NATIONS . He is furious with all their armies . He has condemned them for destruction . He has handed them over to be slaughtered .
Their dead bodies will be thrown out . A stench will rise from their corpses . The mountains will be laid waste with their blood .
All the stars in the sky will dissolve . The heavens will be rolled up like a scroll . The stars will fade away like leaves fall from a vine or fruit from a tree .
My sword is covered with blood in the heavens . It will fall on EDOM and on the people I have claimed for destruction .
Jehovah’s sword is covered with blood . It is covered with fat , with the blood of lambs and goats , with the fat of rams' kidneys . Jehovah will receive a sacrifice in Bozrah , a huge slaughter in the land of Edom .
Wild oxen will be killed with them , young bulls along with rams . Their land will be drenched with blood . Their dust will be covered with fat .
Jehovah will have a day of vengeance ! He will have a year of retribution recompense in defense of Zion .
Edom's streams will be turned to tar . Its soil will be turned to burning sulfur . Its land will become blazing tar .
They will not be extinguished day or night , and smoke will always go up from them . Edom will lie in ruins for generations . No one will ever travel through it .
Pelicans and herons will take possession of the land . Porcupines and crows will live there . He will stretch the measuring line of chaos and the plumb line of destruction over it .
There are no nobles to rule a kingdom . All of its princes have disappeared .
Its palaces are covered with thorns . Its fortresses have nettles and thistles . It will become a home for jackals and a place for ostriches .
Hyenas will meet with jackals . Male goats will call to their mates . Screech owls will rest there and find a resting place for themselves .
Arrow snakes will make their nests there , lay eggs , and hatch them . They will gather their young under their shadow . Vultures also will gather there , each one with its mate .
Search Jehovah’s book and read it out loud . Not one of these animals will be missing . Not one will lack a mate , because Jehovah has commanded it , and his Spirit will gather them together .
He is the one who casts the lot for them , and his hand divides up the land for them with a measuring line . They will possess it permanently and live there for generations .
The desert will rejoice , and flowers will bloom in the wastelands .
The desert will sing and shout for joy ! It will be beautiful like the Lebanon Mountains . It will be fertile as the fields of Carmel and Sharon . Everyone will see Jehovah’s splendor . They will see his greatness and power .
Strengthen the tired hands and the knees that tremble with weakness .
Tell the discouraged ones with anxious heart : » Be strong and do not be afraid ! God is coming to your rescue ! He is coming to punish your enemies . «
Then the blind will be able to see , and the deaf will hear .
The lame will leap and dance , and those who cannot speak will shout for joy . Streams of water will flow through the desert plain .
The parched ground will become a lake , and dry land will be filled with springs . Marsh grass and reeds will grow where jackals used to live .
There will be a highway there , called : » The Road of Holiness . « No sinner will ever travel that road . No fools will mislead those who follow it .
No lions will be there . No fierce animals will pass that way ! Those whom Jehovah has rescued will travel home by that road .
They will reach Jerusalem with gladness , singing and shouting for joy . They will be happy forever . They will be forever free from sorrow and grief .
It was Hezekiah's fourteenth year as king . King Sennacherib of Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them .
The king of Assyria sent his field commander with a large army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem . He stood at the channel for the Upper Pool on the road to the Laundryman's Field .
Eliakim , who was in charge of the palace and was the son of Hilkiah , Shebna the scribe , and Joah , who was the royal historian and the son of Asaph , went out to the field commander .
He said to them : » Tell Hezekiah , This is what the great king , the king of Assyria , says : ‘ What makes you so confident ?
» ‘ You give useless advice about getting ready for war . Whom do you trust for support in your rebellion against me ?
» When you trust Egypt , you trust a broken stick for a staff . If you lean on it , it stabs your hand and goes through it . This is what Pharaoh king of Egypt is like for everyone who trusts him .
» ‘ Suppose you say : ‘ We are trusting Jehovah our God . He is the god whose places of worship and altars Hezekiah got rid of . Hezekiah told Judah and Jerusalem : Worship at this altar . ’ « ’
» Now , make a deal with my master , the king of Assyria . I will give you two thousand horses if you can put riders on them .
» How can you defeat my master's lowest-ranking officers when you trust Egypt for chariots and horses ?
» Have I come to destroy this country without Jehovah on my side ? Jehovah said to me : Attack this country , and destroy it . ’ « ’
Then Eliakim , Shebna , and Joah said to the field commander : » Speak to us in Aramaic , since we understand it . Do not speak to us in the Judean language as long as there are people on the wall listening . «
However the field commander asked : » Did my master send me to tell these things only to you and your master ? Did he not send me to the men sitting on the wall who will have to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine with you ? «
Then the field commander stood and shouted loudly in the Judean language : » Listen to the great king , the king of Assyria .
» ‘ This is what the king says : ‘ Do not let Hezekiah deceive you . He cannot rescue you .
» ‘ Do not let Hezekiah get you to trust Jehovah by saying : ‘ Jehovah will certainly rescue us , and this city will not be put under the control of the king of Assyria .
» ‘ Do not listen to Hezekiah , because this is what the king of Assyria says : Make peace with me ! Come out , and give yourselves up to me ! Everyone will eat from his own grapevine and fig tree and drink from his own cistern .
» ‘ Then I will come and take you away to a country like your own . It is a country with grain and new wine , a country with bread and vineyards .
» ‘ Do not let Hezekiah mislead you by saying to you : ‘ Jehovah will rescue us . Did any of the gods of the nations rescue their countries from the king of Assyria ?
» ‘ Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad ? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim ? Did they rescue Samaria from my control ?
» ‘ Did the gods of these countries indeed rescue them from my control ? Could Jehovah then rescue Jerusalem from my control ? ’ «
They were silent and did not say anything to him because the king commanded them not to answer him .
Then Eliakim , who was in charge of the palace and was son of Hilkiah , Shebna the scribe , and Joah , who was the royal historian and the son of Asaph , went to Hezekiah with their clothes torn in grief . They told him the message from the field commander .
King Hezekiah heard it and he tore his clothes . He covered himself with sackcloth and entered the house of Jehovah .
Hezekiah sent Eliakim the palace administrator along with Shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz .
They said to him : » Hezekiah says : ‘ This day is a day of distress , rebuke and rejection . Children have come to birth , and there is no strength to deliver .
» ‘ Perhaps Jehovah your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh . His master the king of Assyria has sent him to reproach the living God ! He will rebuke the words Jehovah your God has heard . Therefore , offer a prayer for the remnant that survives . ’ «
So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah .
Isaiah said to them : » Say to your master : ‘ Jehovah says : » Do not be afraid because of the words you have heard from the servants of the king of Assyria . For they have blasphemed me .
» ‘ » Listen ! I will put a spirit in him so that he will hear a rumor and return to his own land . I will make him fall by the sword in his own land . « ’ «
Then Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah . He had heard a report that the king had left Lachish .
He heard this concerning Tirhakah king of Cush : » He has come out to fight against you . « So he sent messengers to Hezekiah and said :
» Say to Hezekiah king of Judah : ‘ Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you . He says to you : » Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria . «
» ‘ You have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries . He destroyed them completely . And will you be delivered ?
» ‘ Did the gods of the nations that were destroyed by my forefathers deliver them ? And what about the gods of Gozan , Haran , Rezeph and the people of Eden who were in Tel Assar ?
» ‘ Where is the king of Hamath , the king of Arpad , the king of the city of Sepharvaim , or of Hena or Ivvah ? ’ «
Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it . He went to the temple of Jehovah and spread it out before Jehovah .
Hezekiah prayed to Jehovah :
» O Jehovah of Hosts , God of Israel , enthroned between the cherubim , you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth . You have made heaven and earth .
» Give ear , O Jehovah , and hear ! Open your eyes , O Jehovah , and see ! Listen to all the words Sennacherib said to insult the living God .
» It is true , Jehovah , that the Assyrian kings have laid waste all these peoples and their lands .
» They have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them . But they were not gods ! They were only wood and stone , fashioned by human hands .
» Now , O Jehovah our God , deliver us from his hand . That way all kingdoms on earth may know that you alone , O Jehovah , are God .
Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah : » This is what Jehovah , the God of Israel , says : ‘ Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria ,
this is the word Jehovah spoke against him : » The Virgin Daughter of Zion despises and mocks you . The Daughter of Jerusalem tosses her head as you flee .
» Who is it you have insulted and blasphemed ? Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes in pride ? It is against the Holy One of Israel !
» By your messengers you have heaped insults on Jehovah . You said : With my many chariots I have ascended the heights of the mountains , the utmost heights of Lebanon . I cut down its tallest cedars , the choicest of its pines . I reach its remotest heights , the finest of its forests .
» I dug wells and drank the water there . With the bottom of my feet I dried up all the streams of Egypt .
» Have you not heard ? Long ago I ordained it . In days of old I planned it ! And now I have brought it to pass , that you have turned fortified cities into piles of stone .
» Their people are drained of power . They are dismayed and put to shame . They are like plants in the field , like tender green shoots , like grass sprouting on the roof , parched before it grows .
» I know where you stay and when you come and go and how you rage against me .
» For the reason that you rage against me and because your insolence arrogance has reached my ears , I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth . I will make you return by the way you came . «
» ‘ This will be the sign for you , O Hezekiah : ‘ This year you will eat what grows by itself . The second year you will eat what springs from that . But in the third year sow and reap , plant vineyards and eat their fruit .
» ‘ Again a remnant of the house of Judah will take root below and bear fruit above .
» ‘ Out of Jerusalem will come a remnant , and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors . The zeal of the Lord Jehovah will accomplish this .
» ‘ Therefore this is what Jehovah says concerning the king of Assyria : » He will not enter this city or shoot an arrow here . He will not come before it with shield , or build a siege ramp against it .
» ‘ He will return by the way that he came . He will not enter this city , declares Jehovah .
» ‘ I will defend this city and save it , for my sake and for the sake of David my servant ! ’ «
The angel of Jehovah put to death a hundred and eighty-five thousand men in the Assyrian camp . The people got up the next morning and saw all the dead bodies !
So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew . He returned to Nineveh and stayed there .
One day , while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch , his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer cut him down with the sword . They escaped to the land of Ararat . Esarhaddon his son succeeded him as king .
King Hezekiah became sick and almost died . The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to see him . Isaiah said to him : » Jehovah tells you : ‘ You are to put everything in order because you will not recover . Get ready to die . « ’
Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to Jehovah :
» Remember , Jehovah , that I have served you faithfully and loyally . I have always tried to do what you wanted me to . « Then he cried bitterly .
Then Jehovah commanded Isaiah
to go back to Hezekiah and say to him : » I Jehovah , the God of your ancestor David , have heard your prayer and seen your tears . I will add fifteen more years to your life .
» I will rescue you and this city of Jerusalem from the king of Assyria , and I will continue to protect the city . «
Isaiah said : « This is your sign from Jehovah that he will do what he promises .
» The sun made a shadow that went down the stairway of the upper palace of Ahaz . ‘ I am going to make the shadow go back ten steps . ’ « So the sun on the stairway went back up the ten steps it had gone down .
King Hezekiah of Judah wrote this after he was sick and became well again :
» I thought that in the prime of my life I would go down to the gates of the grave and be robbed of the rest of my life .
» I thought that I would not see Jehovah in this world . Even with all the people in the world , I thought I would never see another person .
» My life was over . You rolled it up like a shepherd's tent . You rolled up my life like a weaver . You cut me off from the loom . You ended my life in one day .
» Until morning came , I thought you would crush my bones just like a hungry lion ; both night and day you make an end of me .
» I cry like a swallow swift . I mourn like a dove . My eyes are red from looking to you , Jehovah . I am terribly abused . Please come and help me .
» There is nothing I can say in answer to you . For you are the one who has done this to me . My life has turned sour . I will limp until I die .
» Your words and your deeds bring life to everyone , including me . Please make me healthy and strong again .
» Yes , it was for my benefit that I suffered such distress . In your love you kept me from the pit of destruction . You have put thrown hurled all my sins behind your back .
» For the grave cannot praise you , death cannot sing your praise . Those who go down to the pit cannot hope for your faithfulness .
» The living , yes the living praise you , as I am doing today ! Fathers tell their children about your faithfulness .
» Jehovah will save me ! We will sing with stringed instruments all the days of our lives in the Temple of Jehovah . «
Isaiah said : » Prepare a poultice of figs and apply it to the boil , and he will recover . «
Hezekiah said : » What will be the sign that I will go up to the Temple of Jehovah ? «
At that time Merodach-Baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent Hezekiah letters and a gift , because he had heard of his illness and recovery .
Hezekiah received the envoys gladly and showed them what was in his storehouses . He showed them the silver , the gold , the spices , the fine oil , his entire armory and everything found among his treasures . There was nothing in his palace or in his entire kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them .
Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked : » What did those men say , and where did they come from ? « Hezekiah replied : » They came from the distant land of Babylon . «
The prophet asked : » What did they see in your palace ? » They saw everything in my palace , « Hezekiah said . » There is nothing among my treasures that I did not show them . «
Isaiah said to Hezekiah : » Hear the word of the Jehovah of Hosts :
» ‘ The time will come when everything in your palace , and all that your fathers have stored up until this day , will be carried off to Babylon . Nothing will be left , ’ ’ says Jehovah .
» ‘ Some of your descendants , your own flesh and blood who will be born to you , will be taken away ! They will become officers in the palace of the king of Babylon . ’ «
» The word of Jehovah you have spoken is good , « Hezekiah replied . For he thought : » There will be peace and security in my lifetime . «
» Comfort , comfort my people , « says your God .
» Speak tenderly to Jerusalem , and proclaim to her that her hard service has been completed . Her sin has been paid for and she has received double for all her sins from Jehovah’s hand . «
A voice of one calling : » In the wilderness prepare the way for Jehovah . Make straight in the desert a highway for our God .
» Every valley will be raised up ! Every mountain and hill made low . The rough ground will become level and the rugged places a plain .
» The glory of Jehovah will be revealed and together all mankind will see it . For the mouth of Jehovah has spoken ! «
A voice shouts : » Cry out ! « And I said : » What shall I cry ? « The voice shouts : » All men are like grass , and all their glory is like the flowers of the field .
» The grass withers and the flowers fall , because the breath of Jehovah blows on them . Surely the people are grass .
» The grass withers and the flowers fall , but the word of our God stands forever . «
You bring good news to Zion . Go up on a high mountain . You bring good news to Jerusalem . Lift up your voice with a shout ! Lift it up and do not be afraid ! Say to the towns of Judah : » Here is your God ! «
See the Sovereign Lord Jehovah comes with power . His arm power rules for him . See , his reward is with him and his recompense accompanies him .
He tends his flock like a shepherd . He gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them close to his heart . He gently leads those that have young .
Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand , or with the span of his hand marked off the heavens ? Who has held the dust of the earth in a basket , or weighed the mountains on the scales and the hills in a balance of the scale ?
Who has understood the mind of Jehovah , or has instructed him , as his counselor ?
Whom did Jehovah consult to enlighten him ? Who taught him the right way ? Who was it that taught him knowledge or showed him the path of understanding ?
Truly the nations are like a drop in a bucket ! They are regarded as dust on the scales ! He weighs the islands as though they were fine dust .
Lebanon is not sufficient for altar fires , nor its animals enough for burnt offerings .
Before him all the nations are as nothing ! He regards them as worthless and less than nothing .
To whom , then , will you compare God ? What image will you compare him to ?
As for an idol , a craftsman casts it , and a goldsmith overlays it with gold and fashions silver chains for it .
A man too poor to present such an offering selects wood that will not rot . He looks for a skilled craftsman to set up an idol that will not topple .
Have you not known ? Have you not heard ? Has it not been told to you from the beginning ? Have you not understood since the earth was founded ?
He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth , and its people are like grasshoppers . He stretches out the heavens like a canopy , and spreads them out like a tent to live in .
He brings princes to nothing and reduces the rulers of this world to nothing .
No sooner are they planted , no sooner are they sown , no sooner do they take root in the ground , than he blows on them and they wither , and a whirlwind sweeps them away like chaff .
» To whom will you compare me ? Who is my equal ? « says the Holy One .
» Lift your eyes and look to the heavens . Who created all these ? The being that brings out the starry host one by one , and calls them each by name created all these ! Because of his great power and mighty strength , not one of them is missing .
» ‘ Why do you say , O Jacob , and complain , O Israel : ‘ My way is hidden from Jehovah ! My God disregards my cause ? ’
» Do you not know ? Have you not heard ? JEHOVAH IS THE EVERLASTING GOD , the Creator of the ends of the earth . He will not grow tired or weary , and no one can measure find out his understanding .
» He gives strength to those who grow tired and increases the strength of those who are weak .
Even young people grow tired and weary , and young men stumble and fall .
» Those who hope in Jehovah will renew their strength . They will soar on wings like eagles . They will run and not grow weary ! They will walk and not be faint . «
» Be silent before me , you islands ! Let the nations renew their strength ! Let them come forward and speak . Let us meet together at the place of judgment .
» Who has stirred up one from the east , calling him in righteousness to his service ? He hands nations over to him and subdues kings before him . He turns them to dust with his sword , to windblown chaff with his bow .
» He pursues them and moves on unscathed . He goes by a path his feet have not traveled before .
» Who has done this and carried it through , calling forth the generations from the beginning ? I , Jehovah have done this with the first of them and with the last . I am he ! «
The islands have seen it and fear . The ends of the earth tremble . They approach and come forward .
Each helps the other and says to his brother : » Be strong ! «
The craftsman encourages the goldsmith . He who smooths with the hammer spurs on him who strikes the anvil . He says of the welding : It is good . He nails down the idol so it will not topple .
» However you , O Israel , my servant , Jacob , whom I have chosen , you descendants of Abraham , my friend ,
» ‘ I took you from the ends of the earth . I called you from its farthest corners . I said : ‘ You are my servant . I have chosen you and have not rejected you .
» ‘ Do not fear for I am with you ! Do not be dismayed for I am your God . I will strengthen you and help you . I will uphold you with my righteous right hand . ’
» All who rage against you will be ashamed and disgraced . Those who oppose you will be as nothing and perish .
» Though you search for your enemies , you will not find them . Those who wage war against you will be as nothing at all .
» I AM JEHOVAH , YOUR GOD ! I take hold of your right hand and say to you : Do not fear ; I will help you .
» Do not be afraid , O worm Jacob , O little Israel , for I will help you . This is the declaration of Jehovah , your Redeemer , and the Holy One of Israel .
» See I will make you into a threshing sledge , new and sharp , with many teeth . You will thresh the mountains and crush them . You will reduce the hills to chaff .
» You will winnow them . The wind will pick them up and a gale will blow them away . But you will rejoice in Jehovah and glory in the Holy One of Israel .
» The poor and needy search for water , but there is none ! Their tongues are parched with thirst . But I Jehovah will answer them . I , the God of Israel , will not forsake them .
» I will make rivers flow on barren heights , and springs within the valleys . I will turn the desert into pools of water , and the parched ground into springs .
» I will put the cedar and the acacia , the myrtle and the olive in the desert . I will set pines in the wasteland , the fir and the cypress together .
» People may see and know , may consider and understand , that the hand power of Jehovah has done this , that the Holy One of Israel has created it .
» Present your case , « says Jehovah . » Set forth your arguments , says Jacob’s King .
» Bring in your idols to tell us what is going to happen . Tell us what the former things were , so that we may consider them and know their final outcome . Or declare to us the things to come .
» Tell us what the future holds , so we may know that you are gods . Do something , whether good or bad , so that we will be shocked and filled with fear .
» You are less than nothing and your works are utterly worthless ! He who chooses you is detestable .
» I have stirred up one from the north , and he comes ! One from the rising sun calls on my name . He treads on rulers as if they were mortar , as if he were a potter treading the clay .
» Who told of this from the beginning , so we could know , or beforehand , so we could say : He was right ? No one told of this , no one foretold it . No one heard any words from you ! «
I was the first to tell Zion : » Look , here they are ! « I gave to Jerusalem a messenger of good news .
I look but there is no one . There is no one among them to give counsel ! There is no one to give answer when I ask them .
See they are all false hurtful nonexistent ! Their deeds amount to nothing ! Their images are but wind and confusion .
Here is my servant , whom I have strengthened . Here is the one I have chosen , with whom I am pleased . I have filled him with my Spirit , and he will bring justice to every nation .
He will not shout or raise his voice or make loud speeches in the streets .
He will not break off a bent reed nor extinguish a flickering lamp . He will bring lasting justice to all .
He will not lose hope or courage . He will establish justice on the earth . Distant lands eagerly wait for his law .
God created the heavens and stretched them out . He fashioned the earth and all that lives there . He gave life and breath to all its people . And now Jehovah God says to his servant :
» I , Jehovah , have called you and have given you power to see that justice is done on earth . I will make a covenant with all peoples and bring light truth light of instruction to the nations through you .
» You will open the eyes of the blind and set free those who sit in dark prisons .
» I ALONE AM JEHOVAH . THAT IS MY NAME . I WILL NOT GIVE MY GLORY TO ANOTHER ! I will not let idols share my praise .
» The things I predicted have now come true . Now I will tell you of new things even before they begin to happen . «
Sing a new song to Jehovah . Sing his praise , all the world ! Praise him , you that sail the sea . Praise him , all creatures of the sea ! Sing , distant lands and all who live there !
Let the desert and its towns praise God . Let the people of Kedar praise him ! Let those who live in the city of Sela shout for joy from the tops of the mountains !
Let those who live in distant lands give praise and glory to Jehovah !
Jehovah goes out to fight like a warrior . He is ready and eager for battle . He gives a war cry , a battle shout and he shows his power against his enemies .
» I kept silent for a long time . I did not answer my people . The time to act has come . I cry out like a woman in labor .
» I will destroy the hills and mountains and dry up the grass and trees . I will turn the river valleys into deserts and dry up the pools of water .
» I will lead my blind people by roads they have never traveled . I will turn their darkness into light and make rough country smooth before them . I will keep my promises without fail . «
Those who trust in idols and call images their gods will be humiliated and disgraced .
Jehovah says : » Hear , you deaf people ! Look closely , you who are blind ! «
Is anyone more blind than my servant or more deaf than the messenger I send ?
Israel , you have seen so much , but what has it meant to you ? You have ears to hear with , but what have you really heard ?
Jehovah is a God who is eager to save . He exalted his laws and teachings , and he wanted his people to honor them .
Now his people have been plundered . They are locked up in dungeons and hidden away in prisons . They were robbed and plundered , with no one to come to their rescue .
Will any of you listen to this ? From now on will you listen with care ?
Who gave Israel up to the looters ? It was Jehovah , against whom we sinned ! We would not live as he wanted us to live or obey the teachings he gave us .
So he made us feel the force of his anger and suffer the violence of war . Like fire his anger burned throughout Israel . Yet we never knew what was happening . We learned nothing at all from it .
Jehovah created Jacob and formed Israel . Jehovah says : » Do not be afraid for I have reclaimed you . I have called you by my name . You are mine .
» When you go through the sea , I am with you . When you go through rivers , they will not sweep you away . When you walk through fire , you will not be burned , and the flames will not harm you .
» I AM JEHOVAH YOUR GOD , THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL , YOUR SAVIOR . Egypt is the ransom I exchanged for you . Sudan and Seba are the price I paid for you .
» I honor you because you are precious to me and I love you . I will exchange others for you . Nations will be the price I pay for your life .
» Do not be afraid for I am with you . I will bring your descendants from the east and gather you from the west .
» ‘ I will say to the north , ‘ Give them up , ’ ’ and to the south , ‘ do not keep them . Bring my sons from far away and my daughters from the ends of the earth .
» ‘ Bring everyone who is called by my name , whom I created for my glory , whom I formed and made . ’
» Bring the people who are blind but still have eyes , the people who are deaf but still have ears .
» ‘ All nations have gathered together , and people have assembled . Who among them could have revealed this ? Who among them could have foretold this to us ? They should bring their witnesses to prove that they were right . Let the people hear them . Then they will say : ‘ It is the truth . ’ «
» YOU ARE MY WITNESSES , « DECLARES JEHOVAH ! » I have chosen you as my servant so that you can know and believe in me and understand that I am the one who did this . No god was formed before me , and there will be none after me .
» I ALONE AM JEHOVAH , AND THERE IS NO SAVIOR BESIDES ME . «
» I have revealed it to you . I have saved you , and I have announced it to you . There was no foreign god among you . You are my witnesses that I am God , declares Jehovah .
» From the beginning I was the one who did this . No one can rescue people from my power . When I do something , who can undo it ? «
This is what Jehovah , your redeemer , and the Holy One of Israel , says : » For your sake I will send an army to Babylon . I will bring back all the Babylonian refugees in the ships that they take pride in .
» I am Jehovah , your Holy One , the Creator of Israel , your King . «
Jehovah makes a path through the sea and a road through the strong currents .
He leads chariots and horses , an army and reinforcements . » They lie down together and do not get up again . They are extinguished and snuffed out like a wick . « This is what Jehovah says :
» Forget what happened in the past , and do not dwell on events from long ago .
» I am going to do something new . It is already happening . Do you recognize it ? I will clear a way in the desert . I will make rivers on dry land .
» Wild animals , jackals , and ostriches will honor me . I will provide water in the desert . I will make rivers on the dry land for my chosen people to drink .
» I have formed these people for myself . They will praise me .
» Jacob , you have not prayed to me . Israel , you have grown tired of me .
» You did not bring me sheep for your burnt offerings or honor me with your sacrifices . I did not burden you by requiring grain offerings or trouble you by requiring incense offerings .
» You did not buy me any sugar cane with your money or satisfy me with the best part of your sacrifices . Rather , you burdened me with your sins and troubled me with your iniquities .
» I alone am the one who is going to wipe away your rebellious actions for my own sake . I will not remember your sins anymore .
» Remind me of what happened . Let us argue our case together . State your case so that you can prove you are right .
» Your first ancestor sinned , and your priests rebelled against me .
» That is why I will corrupt the leaders of the holy place . I will claim Jacob for destruction . I will set up Israel for ridicule . «
» Listen , O Jacob , my servant , Listen Israel , whom I have chosen .
» ‘ This is what Jehovah says , the one who made you , who formed you in the womb , and who will help you : ‘ Do not be afraid , O Jacob , my servant , Jeshurun , whom I have chosen .
» ‘ I will pour water on the thirsty land , and streams on the dry ground . I will pour out my Spirit on your offspring . I will give blessing to your descendants .
» ‘ They will spring up like grass in a meadow , like poplar trees by flowing streams .
» ‘ » One person will say : » I belong to Jehovah . « Another person will call himself by the name of Jacob . Still another will write on his hand : » Jehovah’s . « And he will take the name Israel . ’
» This is what Jehovah , Israel’s King and Redeemer , Jehovah of Hosts says : ‘ I AM THE FIRST AND I AM THE LAST- APART FROM ME THERE IS NO GOD !
» ‘ Who then is like me ? Let him proclaim it . Let him declare and lay out before me what has happened since I established my ancient people , and what is yet to come — ’ yes , let him foretell what will come .
» ‘ Do not tremble . Do not be afraid . Did I not proclaim this and foretell it long ago ? You are my witnesses ! Is there any God besides me ? No , there is no other Rock . There is not one ! ’ «
All who make idols are nothing . The things they treasure are worthless . Those who would speak up for them are blind . They are shamefully ignorant .
Who shapes a god and casts a useless and good for nothing idol .
He and his kind will be put to shame . Craftsmen are merely men . Let them all come together and take their stand for they will be brought down to terror and infamy .
The blacksmith takes a tool and works with it in the coals . He shapes an idol with hammers ; he forges it with the might of his arm . He gets hungry and loses his strength . He drinks no water and grows faint .
The carpenter measures with a line and makes an outline with a red chalk marker . He roughs it out with chisels and marks it with a compass . He shapes it in the form of man in all his glory , that it may dwell in a shrine .
He cut down cedars , or cypress or oak . He let it grow among the trees of the forest , or planted a pine , and the rain made it grow .
It is man’s fuel for burning so he takes some to warm himself . He kindles a fire and bakes bread . But he also fashions a god and worships it . Yes he makes an idol and bows down to it .
Half of the wood they burn in the fire . Over this half they roast meat that they can eat until they are full . They also warm themselves and say : We are warm . We can see the fire !
But the rest of the wood they make into gods , carved statues . They bow to them and worship them . They pray to them and say : » Rescue us , because you are our gods . «
They do not know or understand anything . Their eyes are plastered shut and cannot see . Their minds are closed and therefore they cannot understand .
No one stops to think . No one has enough knowledge or understanding to say : » I burned half of the wood in the fire . I also baked bread over its coals . I roasted meat and ate it . Now I am making the rest of the wood into a disgusting thing and bowing to a block of wood . «
They eat ashes because they are deceived . Their own misguided minds lead them astray . They cannot rescue themselves or ask themselves : » Is what I hold in my right hand a false god ? «
Jehovah says : » Israel , remember this ! Remember that you are my servant . I created you to be my servant , and I will never forget you .
» I have swept your sins away like a cloud . Come back to me ! I am the one who saves you .
» Shout for joy , you heavens ! Shout , deep places of the earth ! Shout for joy , mountains , and every tree of the forest ! Jehovah has shown his greatness by saving his people Israel . «
» I am Jehovah , your savior . I am the one who created you . I am Jehovah , the Creator of all things . I alone stretched out the heavens ! No one helped me when I made the earth I was by myself Who was with me ? .
» I make fools of fortunetellers and frustrate the predictions of astrologers . The words of the wise I refute and show that their wisdom is foolishness .
» ‘ I make the word of my servant come true . I accomplish the purpose of my messengers . I say of Jerusalem , ' She will be inhabited ! ’ ’ And I say to the cities of Judah , ' You will be rebuilt ! I will make your ruins raise up . ’
» ‘ I say to the watery deep : ‘ Be a waste and I will dry up your rivers ! ’
» ‘ I say of Cyrus : ‘ He is my shepherd and will accomplish all that I please . He will say of Jerusalem , ‘ Let it be rebuilt , ’ ’ and of the Temple , ‘ Let its foundations be laid . ’ «
This is WHAT JEHOVAH SAYS ABOUT CYRUS , his anointed one : » I have held him by his right hand so he could conquer the nations ahead of him ; that he could strip kings of their power , and open doors ahead of him so that the gates would not be shut .
» I will go ahead of you , Cyrus . I will smooth out the rough places . I will break down the copper doors and cut through the iron bars .
» I will give you treasures from dark places and hidden stockpiles . You will know that I , Jehovah the God of Israel , have called you by name .
» For the sake of my servant Jacob , and Israel my chosen one , I have called you by name . I have given you a title of honor , although you do not know me .
» I AM JEHOVAH AND THERE IS NO OTHER . THERE IS NO OTHER GOD BESIDES ME . I will strengthen you , although you do not know me .
» From the east to the west sunrise to sunset people will know that there is no God except me . I am Jehovah , and there is no other .
» I make light and create darkness . I make blessings and create disasters . I , Jehovah , do all these things .
» Rain down from above , you heavens , and pour down righteousness , you skies . Let the earth open . Let salvation and righteousness sprout . Let them spring up for I Jehovah have created them . «
» Does a clay pot dare argue with its maker , a pot that is like all the others ? Does the clay ask the potter what he is doing ? Does the pot complain that its maker has no skill ?
» ‘ Do we dare say to our parents : ‘ Why did you make me like this ? ’
Jehovah , the Holy God of Israel , the one who shapes the future says : » You have no right to question me about my children or to tell me what I ought to do !
» I am the one who made the earth . I created human beings to live there . With my power I stretched out the heavens . I control the sun , the moon , and the stars .
» I have stirred Cyrus to action to fulfill my purpose and put things right . I will straighten out every road that he travels . He will rebuild my city , Jerusalem , and set my captive people free . No one has hired him or bribed him to do this . « Jehovah of Hosts has spoken .
This is what Jehovah says : » The products of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush , and those tall Sabeans will come over to you and will be yours . They will walk behind you . They will come to you in chains . They will bow down before you and plead with you . They will say : ‘ God is with you and there is no other . There is no other god ! ’
Truly you are a God who hides himself , O God and Savior of Israel .
The makers of idols will be put to shame and disgraced . They will go off into disgrace together .
Jehovah will save Israel with an everlasting salvation . You will never be put to shame or disgraced , to ages everlasting .
Jehovah says : » Who created the heavens ? He who is God . He fashioned and made the earth . He founded it and he did not create it to be empty but formed it to be inhabited . « He says : » I am Jehovah , and there is no other .
» I have not spoken in secret , from somewhere in a land of darkness . I have not said to Jacob’s descendants : Seek me in vain . I , Jehovah , speak the truth ; I declare what is right .
» Come here , you refugees from the nations . Ignorant people carry wooden idols and pray to gods that cannot save anyone .
» Speak and present your case . Yes , let them consult one another . Who revealed this in the distant past and predicted it long ago ? Was it not I , Jehovah ? There is no other God except me . There is no other righteous God and Savior besides me .
» Turn to me and be saved ! Turn to me all who live at the ends of the earth for I am God , and there is no other .
» I have bound myself with an oath . A word has gone out from my righteous mouth that will not be recalled . Every knee will bow to me and every tongue will swear allegiance .
» It will be said of me : ‘ Certainly , righteousness and strength are found in Jehovah alone . All who are angry with him will come to him and be ashamed .
» ‘ All the descendants of Israel will be declared righteous , and they will praise Jehovah . ’ «
Bel bows down and Nebo stoops low . Their idols are borne by beasts of burden . The images that are carried about are burdensome . They are a burden for the weary .
They stoop and bow down together . They are unable to rescue the burden and they go off into captivity .
» Listen to me , O house of Jacob , all you who remain of the house of Israel . I have upheld you since you were conceived . I have carried you since your birth .
Even in your old age with gray hair I am he , I am he who will support you . I have made you and I will bear your burden take care of you . I will sustain support strengthen you and I will rescue you keep you safe .
» To whom will you compare me or count me equal ? To whom will you liken me that we may be compared ?
» Some pour out gold from their bags and weigh out silver on the scales . They hire a goldsmith to make it into a god . They bow down and worship it .
» They lift it to their shoulders and carry it . They set it up in its place and there it stands . From that spot it cannot move . Though one cries out to it , it does not answer . It cannot save him from his troubles !
» Remember this ! Keep it in mind and take it to heart , you rebels .
» Remember the former things , the things of long ago . I am God , and there is no other . I am God , and there is none like me .
» I make known the end from the beginning , from ancient times , what is still to come . I say : ‘ My purpose will stand , and I will do all that I please . ’
I summon a bird of prey from the east . I summon a man to fulfill my purpose from a far off land . What I have said I will bring about . What I have determined purposed I will do .
» Listen to me , you stubborn-hearted , you who are far from righteousness .
» I bring near my righteousness . It is not far away . My salvation will not be delayed . I will grant salvation to Zion , my splendor to Israel . «
» Come down and sit in the dust , O virgin daughter of Babylon . Sit on the ground without a throne , O daughter of the Chaldeans ! For you will no longer be called tender and delicate .
» Take the millstones and grind meal . Remove your veil , strip off the skirt ; uncover the leg and cross the rivers .
» Your nakedness will be uncovered and your shame will be exposed . I will take vengeance . I will not spare a man . «
Our Redeemer , Jehovah of Hosts is His name , The Holy One of Israel .
» Sit silently and go into darkness , O daughter of the Chaldeans . You will no longer be called the queen of kingdoms .
» I was angry with my people . I profaned my heritage and gave them into your hand . You did not show mercy to them . You made your yoke very heavy on the aged .
» ‘ You said : ‘ I will be a queen for a very long time ! ’ ’ You did not consider these things or remember their outcome .
» Hear this you sensual one ! You dwell securely and say in your heart : ‘ I am , and there is no one besides me . I will not sit as a widow . I will not lose children . ’
» Two things will come on you suddenly in one day : Loss of children and widowhood . They will come on you in full measure in spite of your abundance of sorceries , in spite of the great power of your spells .
» You felt sure of yourself in your evil . You thought that no one could see you . Your wisdom and knowledge led you astray . Then you said to yourself : ‘ I am God ! There is no one else like me . ’
» Disaster will come upon you , and none of your magic can stop it . Ruin will come on you suddenly , ruin you never dreamed of !
Keep all your magic spells and charms . You have used them since you were young . Perhaps they will be of some help to you . Perhaps you can frighten your enemies .
» You are powerless in spite of the advice you get . Let your astrologers come forward and save you ! Let those people who study the stars , who map out the zones of the heavens tell you from month to month what is going to happen to you .
» Surely they are like stubble . The fire will burn them up . They cannot even save themselves from the power of the flame . Here are no coals to warm anyone and no fire to sit by .
» That is all they can do for you , these you have labored with and trafficked with since childhood . Each of them goes on in his error . No one can save you .
Listen to this , people of Israel , you that are descended from Judah . You swear by the name of Jehovah and claim to worship the God of Israel . However you do not mean a word you say .
Yet you are proud to say that you are citizens of the holy city and that you depend on Israel's God , whose name is Jehovah of Hosts .
Jehovah says to Israel : » Long ago I predicted what would take place . Then suddenly I made it happen .
» I knew that you would prove to be stubborn . You were as rigid as iron and unyielding as copper .
» I predicted your future long ago . I announced events before they took place , to keep you from claiming that your idols and images made them happen .
» All I foretold has now taken place . You have to admit my predictions were right . Now I will tell you of new things to come , events that I did not reveal before .
They are created now , not in the past . You have not heard about them before today , so you cannot say that you already knew about them .
» You have never heard about them . You have never known about them . Your ears have never been open to hear them before . I know that you have acted very treacherously and that you have been called a rebel since you were born .
» For my name's sake I will be patient . For my glory's sake I will hold my anger back from you , and not destroy you .
» I have been testing you for myself like silver . I have put you through the fire of trouble .
» I did it for myself and because of my name . I will not let my name be shamed profaned . I will not give my glory to another .
» Listen to me Jacob and Israel , my loved one . I am he , I am the first and I am the last .
» My hand laid the foundation of the earth . My right hand stretched out the heavens . When I call for them , they both stand .
» Gather together , all of you , and listen . What idol has revealed such things ? Jehovah loves Cyrus . He will carry out Jehovah’s plan against Babylon . He will use his strength against the Babylonians .
» I alone have spoken . I have called him . I will bring him here and he will succeed .
» Come here . Listen to this ! From the beginning I have spoken nothing in private . From the time it took place , I was there . Now the Lord Jehovah has sent me , and his Spirit .
This is what Jehovah your Defender Redeemer , the Holy One of Israel , says : » I am Jehovah your God . I teach you what is best for you . I lead you where you should go .
» If only you had listened to my commandments ! Your peace would be like a river that never runs dry . Your righteousness would be like waves on the sea .
» Your descendants would be like sand . Your children would be like its grains . Their names would not be cut off or wiped out in my presence . «
Get out of Babylon ! Flee from the Babylonians ! Shout for joy as you tell it and announce it . Shout it out to the ends of the earth . Say : » Jehovah has reclaimed his servant Jacob .
» They were not thirsty when he led them through the deserts . He made water flow from a rock for them . He split a rock , and water gushed out .
» There is no peace for the wicked , « says Jehovah .
Listen to this , you islands ! Pay attention you people far away . Jehovah chose me long before I was born . He recorded my name while I was in my mother’s womb .
He made my tongue like a sharp sword . He hid me in the palm of his hand . He made me like a sharpened arrow and hid me in his quiver .
He said to me : » You are my servant , Israel , in whom I will show my glory . «
I said : » I have toiled in vain . I have spent my energy for nothing and vanity . Yet , to be sure , the justice due to me is with Jehovah . My reward is with my God . «
Jehovah formed me in the womb to be his servant . I am to bring Jacob back to him and gather Israel to him . Jehovah honors me . My God has become my strength .
He says : » It is a small thing that you are my servant . You will raise up the tribes of Jacob and restore the preserved ones of Israel . I will also make you a light to the nations that my salvation will reach to the end of the earth . «
Israel’s Holy God and Savior says to the one who is deeply despised , hated by the nations and is the servant of rulers : » Kings will see you released and will rise to show their respect . Princes will also see it and they will bow low to honor you . «
This is what Jehovah says : » In the time of favor I will answer you . I will appoint you as my promise to the people . You will restore the land . You will make them inherit the desolate inheritance . «
Say to those who are bound : » Go forth , to those in the darkness and show yourselves . They will feed along the roads and their pasture is on all bare heights .
» They will never be hungry or thirsty . The sun and the burning hot wind will not strike them . The one who has compassion on them will lead them and guide them to springs .
» I will make all my mountains a road . My highways will be raised up .
» They will come from far away . They will come from the north and from the west . They will come from the land of Sinim . «
Shout for joy , O heavens ! Rejoice , O earth ! Break into joyful shouting , O mountains ! For Jehovah has comforted his people . He will have compassion on his afflicted .
Zion replied : » Jehovah has forsaken me and Jehovah has forgotten me ! «
Can a woman forget her nursing child ? Will she have no compassion on the child from her womb ? Although mothers forget , I will not forget you .
I have inscribed you on the palms of my hands . Your walls are constantly before me .
Your children will hurry back . Those who destroyed you and laid you waste will leave you .
Lift up your eyes and look around for they all gather together and come to you . » As I live , « declares Jehovah , » you will certainly wear them like jewels and bind them on like a bride does . «
» Even if you are destroyed and demolished , and your land is in ruins , you will be too crowed for your people . Those who devoured you will be long gone .
» ‘ The children removed from you will say to you : ‘ This place is too crowed for me . Make room for me to live here . ’
» ‘ You will think in your heart : ‘ Who brought these children to birth ? I am barren sterile and bereaved of my children . I am an exiled wonderer . Who gave birth to these ? From where did these come ? ’
» Behold , I will lift up my hand to the nations , « said Jehovah . » I will set up my standard for the peoples . They will bring your sons and your daughters in their bosom and carried on their shoulders .
» Kings will be your guardians . Their princesses will be your nurses . They will bow down to you with their faces to the earth . They will lick the dust of your feet . Then you will know that I am Jehovah . Those who hopefully wait for me will not be put to shame .
» Can the prey be taken from the strong man ? Can the captives be rescued from the tyrant ? «
Certainly Jehovah says : » The captives of the strong man will be taken away . The prey of the tyrant will be rescued . I will contend with the one who grapples with you and I will save your sons .
» I will feed oppressors with their own flesh . They will be intoxicated with their own blood as if by sweet wine . Everyone will know that I am Jehovah , your Savior and Redeemer , the mighty One of Jacob . «
This is what Jehovah says : » Where are your mother's divorce papers ? Did I give her any to get rid of her ? To which of my creditors did I sell you ? You were sold because of your sins . I got rid of your mother because of your rebellion .
» Why was no one here when I came ? Why was no one here to answer when I called ? Am I too weak to reclaim you ? Do I not have the power to rescue you ? I dry up the sea with my command , and I turn rivers into deserts . Their fish stink because there is no water , and people die of thirst .
» I clothe the heavens in darkness and cover them with sackcloth . «
The Lord Jehovah will teach me what to say , so I will know how to encourage tired people . Morning after morning he will wake me to listen like a student .
The Lord Jehovah has opened my ears . I will not rebel , nor will I turn away from him .
I will offer my back to those who whip me . I will offer my cheeks to those who pluck hairs out of my beard . I will not turn my face away from those who humiliate me and spit on me .
The Lord Jehovah helps me . That is why I will not be ashamed . I have set my face like a flint firm and resolute . I know that I will not be put to shame .
The one who pronounces me innocent is near . Who will bring a case against me ? Let us confront each other ! Who accuses me ? Let him draw near to me !
The Lord Jehovah helps me . Who will find me guilty ? They will all wear out like a garment and moths will eat them .
Who among you respects Jehovah and obeys his servant ? Let those who walk in darkness and have no light trust the name of Jehovah and depend upon their God .
But all of you light fires and arm yourselves with flaming torches . So walk in your own light and among the torches you have lit . This is what you will receive from me : You will be tormented .
» Listen to me , you who pursue righteousness and who seek Jehovah . Look to the rock from which you were hewn and to the quarry from which you were dug out .
» Look to Abraham , your father , and to Sarah , who gave you birth . When I called him he was only one . I blessed him and made him many . «
Jehovah will surely comfort Zion . He will look with compassion on all her ruins . He will make her deserts like Eden and her wastelands like the garden of Jehovah . Joy and gladness will be found in her along with thanksgiving and the sound of singing .
» Listen to me , my people ; hear me , my nation . The law will go out from me . My justice will become a light to the nations .
» My righteousness is near . My salvation is on the way and my arm power will bring justice to the nations . The islands will look to me and wait in hope for my arm power .
» Lift up your eyes to the heavens . Look at the earth below . The heavens will vanish like smoke and the earth will wear out like a garment . Its inhabitants die like flies gnats . But my salvation will last forever ! My righteousness will never fail .
» Hear me , you who know what is right , you people who have my law in your hearts . Do not fear the reproach of men or be terrified by their insults .
» The moth will eat them up like a garment . The worm will devour them like wool . But my righteousness will last forever ! My salvation will last through all generations . «
Awake , awake ! Clothe yourself with strength , O arm of Jehovah . Awake , as in days gone by , as in generations of old . Was it not you who cut Rahab to pieces , who pierced that monster through ?
Was it not you who dried up the sea , the waters of the great deep , who made a road in the depths of the sea so that the redeemed might cross over ?
Jehovah’s ransomed will return . They will enter Zion with singing ! Everlasting joy will crown their heads . Gladness and joy will overtake them , and sorrow and sighing will flee away .
» I , even I , am the one who comforts you . Who are you that you fear mortal men ? The sons of men are like grass !
» You forget Jehovah your Maker , who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth . Will you live in constant terror of the human oppressor , who is bent on your destruction ? Will you fear your enemies from morning until night ?
» The cowering prisoners will soon be set free . They will not die in their dungeon , nor will they lack bread .
» I am Jehovah your God , who churns up the sea so that its waves roar . Jehovah of Hosts is his name .
» I have put my words in your mouth and covered you with the shadow of my hand protection of my power , Holy Spirit . I set the heavens in place and laid the foundations of the earth . Yet I say to Zion : ‘ You are my people ! « ’
Awake , awake ! Rise up , O Jerusalem , you who have drunk from the hand of Jehovah the cup of his wrath , you who have drained to its dregs the goblet that makes men stagger .
Of all the sons she bore there was none to guide her ; of all the sons she reared there was none to take her by the hand .
These double calamities have come upon you . Who can comfort you ? You experience ruin and destruction , famine and sword . Who can console you ?
Your sons have fainted . They lie at the head of every street . They are like antelope caught in a net . They are filled with the rage of Jehovah and the rebuke of your God .
Therefore hear this , you afflicted one , made drunk , but not with wine .
This is what your Lord Jehovah says , your God , who defends his people : » See , I have taken out of your hand the cup that made you stagger . You will never drink from that cup , that cup of wrath , again .
» I will put it into the hands of your tormentors , who said to you : ‘ Lie down that we may walk all over you . You made your back like the ground like a street to be walked over . « ’
Awake , awake , O Zion , put on your strength . Put on your beautiful garments , O Jerusalem , the holy city . The uncircumcised and defiled will not enter you again .
Shake off your dust ! Rise up and sit enthroned , O Jerusalem . Free yourself from the chains on your neck , O captive Daughter of Zion .
For this is what Jehovah says : » You were sold for nothing , and without money you will be redeemed . «
The Lord Jehovah says : » At first my people went down to Egypt to live as aliens . Now Assyria has oppressed them . «
» What do I have here ? « Declares Jehovah . » For my people have been taken away for nothing . Those who rule them mock , « declares Jehovah . » And all day long my name is constantly blasphemed .
» Therefore my people will all know my name ! In that day they will know that it is I who foretold it . Yes , it is I ! «
How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news , who proclaim peace and who bring good tidings of good things ! For they proclaim salvation and say to Zion : » Your God reigns as king ! « Hebrew : Elohiym ’ ’ malak ’ : God rules !
Listen ! Your watchmen lift up their voices . Together they shout for joy . They will see it with their own eyes when Jehovah returns to Zion .
Burst into songs of joy together , you ruins of Jerusalem ! Jehovah has comforted his people . He has redeemed Jerusalem .
Jehovah will lay bare his holy arm show his holy power in the sight of all the nations , and all the ends of the earth will see the salvation of our God .
Get out of her my people ! Touch no unclean thing ! Come out from it and be pure , you who carry the vessels of Jehovah .
You will not leave in haste or go in panic . For Jehovah will go before you . The God of Israel will be your rear guard .
My servant will act wisely . He will be raised , lifted up and highly exalted .
There were many who were appalled at him and his appearance was disfigured beyond that of any man and his form marred beyond human likeness .
He will startle amaze astonish many nations , and kings will shut their mouths because of him . For what they were not told , they will see , and what they have not heard , they will understand .
THIS IS THE PEOPHESY ABOUT THE MESSIAH . Who has believed our message and to whom has the arm power of Jehovah been revealed ?
He grew up before him like a tender shoot , and like a root out of dry ground . He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him . Nothing in his appearance will make us desire him .
He was despised and rejected by men . He was a man of sorrows familiar with suffering . Like one from whom men hide their faces he was despised . We did not consider him to be worth much .
He took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows . We considered him stricken by God , smitten by him , and afflicted .
But he was pierced for our transgressions ! He was crushed for our iniquities ! The punishment that brought us peace was upon him . There has been healing for us because of his wounds .
We are all like sheep . We have gone astray ! Each of us has turned to his own way . Jehovah has caused the iniquity sin of all of us to be laid on him .
He was oppressed and afflicted and yet he did not open his mouth . He was led like a lamb to the slaughter . He was silent like sheep ready to be sheared . He did not open his mouth .
He was oppressed , judged and taken away . And who can speak of his descendants ? He was removed from the land of the living . He was destroyed because of the transgression of my people .
He was buried like a criminal in a rich mans grave . He had done no wrong , nor was any deceit in his mouth .
It was Jehovah’s will to allow him to be crushed . Even though Jehovah makes his life a guilt offering , he will see his offspring and prolong his days , and the will of Jehovah will prosper in his hand .
After his suffering he will see the light and be satisfied . By his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many . He will bear their iniquities .
Therefore I will give him a portion among the great . He will divide the spoils with the strong . This is because he poured out his life unto death . He was numbered with the transgressors . He bore the sin of many , and made intercession for the transgressors .
» Sing joyfully , O barren woman , you who never bore a child ! Burst into song and shout for joy , you who were never in labor ! More are the children of the desolate woman than of the woman , who has a husband , « proclaims Jehovah .
» Enlarge the place of your tent . Stretch your tent curtains wide and do not hold back . Lengthen your cords and strengthen your stakes .
» For you will spread out to the right and to the left . Your descendants will dispossess nations and settle in their desolate cities .
» Do not be afraid . You will not suffer shame . Do not fear disgrace . You will not be humiliated . You will forget the shame of your youth and remember no more the reproach of your widowhood . «
» For your Maker is your husband . Jehovah of Hosts is his name ! The Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer . He is called the God of all the earth .
» Jehovah will call you back as if you were a wife deserted and distressed in spirit ; a wife , who married young , only to be rejected , says your God .
» For a brief moment I abandoned you , but with deep compassion I will bring you back .
» In a surge of anger I hid my face from you for a moment , but with everlasting kindness I will have compassion on you , « says Jehovah your Redeemer .
» To me this is like the days of Noah , when I swore that the waters of Noah would never again cover the earth . So now I have sworn not to be angry with you , never to rebuke you again .
» Though the mountains be shaken and the hills be removed , yet my unfailing love for you will not be shaken nor my covenant of peace be removed , « says Jehovah . » I have compassion on you . «
» O afflicted city , lashed by storms and not comforted , I will build you with stones of turquoise , your foundations with sapphires .
» I will make your battlements of rubies , your gates of sparkling jewels , and all your walls of precious stones .
» Your sons will all be taught by Jehovah . Your sons will have an abundance of peace .
» You will be established in righteousness . Tyranny will be far from you . You will have nothing to fear . Terror will be far removed and it will not come near you .
» If anyone does attack you , it will not be my doing . Whoever attacks you will surrender to you . «
» I created the blacksmith who fans the coals into flame and forges a weapon fit for its work . I also created the destroyer who will work havoc .
» Weapons forged against you will not prevail ! You will refute every tongue that accuses you . This is the heritage of the servants of Jehovah and this is their vindication from me , « declares Jehovah .
Come , all you who are thirsty , come to the water . You , who have no money , come , buy and eat ! Come , buy wine and milk without money and without cost .
Why spend money on what is not bread , and your labor on what does not satisfy ? Listen , listen to me , and eat what is good , and you will delight in the richest of fare .
Give ear and come to me ; listen to me , that you may live . I will make an everlasting covenant with you , my faithful love promised to David .
Behold , I made him a witness to the peoples , a leader and commander of the nations .
You will summon nations you do not know . Nations that do not know you will run to you , because of Jehovah your God , the Holy One of Israel , for he has endowed you with splendor .
Seek Jehovah while he may be found . Call on him while he is near .
Let the wicked forsake his way and the evil man his thoughts . Let him turn to Jehovah , and he will have mercy on him , and to our God , for he will freely pardon .
» My thoughts are not your thoughts , neither are your ways my ways , « declares Jehovah .
» As the heavens are higher than the earth , so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts .
» As the rain and the snow come down from the sky , and do not return to it without watering the earth and making it bud and flourish , so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater ,
so is my word that goes out from my mouth : It will not return to me empty , but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it .
» You will go out in joy and be led forth in peace . The mountains and hills will burst into song before you , and all the trees of the field will clap their hands .
» Instead of the thornbush the pine tree will grow . Instead of briers the myrtle will grow . This will be for Jehovah’s fame . It will be for an everlasting sign , which will not be destroyed . «
Jehovah says : » Maintain justice and do what is right , for my salvation is close at hand and my righteousness will soon be revealed .
» Blessed is the man who does this , the man who holds it fast , who keeps the Sabbath without desecrating it , and keeps his hand from doing any evil .
» ‘ No foreigner bound to Jehovah should say : ‘ Jehovah will surely exclude separate me from his people . No eunuch should complain : I am only a dry tree . ’ «
For Jehovah says : » To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths , who choose what pleases me . They hold fast to my covenant .
» I will give to those within my Temple and its walls a memorial and a name that is better than sons and daughters . I will give them an everlasting name that will not be cut off .
» Foreigners have become allied with Jehovah , to serve Jehovah , to love the name of Jehovah , and to worship him . They keep the Sabbath without desecrating it and hold fast to my covenant .
» I will bring them to my holy mountain and give them joy in my house of prayer . Their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be accepted on my altar . My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations . «
The Sovereign Lord Jehovah declares : » He who gathers the exiles of Israel , I will gather still others to them besides those already gathered . «
Come , all you beasts of the field , come and devour , all you beasts of the forest !
Israel’s watchmen are blind . They all lack knowledge they are all mute dogs . They cannot bark . They just lie around and dream , they love to sleep .
They are dogs with mighty appetites . They never have enough ! They are shepherds who lack understanding . They all turn to their own way and each one seeks dishonest unjust gain .
» Come , each one cries , let me get wine ! Let us drink our fill of beer ! And tomorrow will be like today , or even far better . «
The righteous perishes and no man takes it to heart . Merciful men are taken away , while no one considers that the righteous is taken away from evil .
He will enter into peace . The honorable and honest will rest in his bed .
» But come here , you sons of the witch , you offspring of the adulterer and the prostitute !
With whom are you effeminate self-indulgent ? With whom do you open wide your mouth and offer your tongue ? Are you not children of transgression , offspring of falsehood and deceit ?
Are you inflaming yourselves with gods under every green tree , slaying the children in the valleys , under the clefts of the rocks ?
» Is your portion among the smooth stones of the stream ? They indeed are your lot ! Even to them you have poured a drink offering . You have offered a grain offering . Should this give me comfort ?
» You placed your bed on a lofty and high mountain . Even there you went up to offer sacrifice .
» You ordained your memorial behind the doors and their posts . You revealed uncovered yourself to those other than me . You went to them . You enlarged your bed and made a covenant with them . You have loved their bed , where you saw their naked manhood .
» You went to the king with ointment and much perfume . You sent your messengers far off , and descended even to the grave .
» You are wearied because of the length of your trip . Yet you did not say : I give up . There is no hope . You have found the renewal of your strength . Therefore you were not grieved .
» Who frightened you ? Who made you afraid , that you have lied and not remembered me ? You did not take it to your heart . Is it not because I have held my peace from of old that you do not reverence respect me ?
» I will declare your righteousness and your works , yet they will not profit you .
» When you cry out , let your collection of idols deliver you . But the wind will carry them all away . A breath will take them . But he who puts his trust in me shall possess the land , and shall inherit my holy mountain .
» ‘ One will say : ‘ Heap it up ! Heap it up ! Prepare the way ; Take the stumbling block out of the way of my people . ’ «
The High and Lofty One who inhabits eternity , whose name is holy , says : ‘ I dwell in the high and holy and also with him who has a contrite and humble spirit . I revive the spirit of the humble , and the heart of the contrite ones . ’
For I will not contend rebuke forever ! Nor will I always be angry ! The spirit would fail before me , and those whom I have made .
Because of the iniquity of his covetousness gain I was angry and struck him . I hid and was angry . He went on backsliding in the way of his heart his heart directed course of life .
I have seen his ways , and will heal him . I will also lead him , and restore comforts to him and to his mourners .
I create the fruit praise of the lips : Peace , peace to the near and the far off , says Jehovah , and I will heal him .
But the wicked are like the troubled and restless sea , whose waters cast up mire and dirt .
My God has said : » There is no peace for the wicked . «
» Cry aloud ! Do not hold back ! Raise your voice like a ram's horn . Tell my people about their rebellion and the descendants of Jacob about their sins .
» They seek me day by day . They delight to know my ways like a nation that has done righteousness and has not forsaken the ordinance of their God . They ask me for justice and delight . They are pleased that God is near .
» ‘ Why have we fasted and you do not see ? Why have we humbled ourselves and you do not notice ? Behold , on the day of your fast you find desire , and mistreat all your workers . ’
» You fast for contention and strife and to strike with a wicked fist . You do not fast today to make your voice heard on high .
» Is it a fast like this which I choose , a day for a man to humble himself ? Is it for bowing one's head like a reed rush and for spreading out sackcloth and ashes as a bed ? Will you call this a fast , even an acceptable day to Jehovah ?
» Is this not the fast I choose to loosen the bonds of wickedness , to undo the bands of the yoke , and to let the oppressed go free and break every yoke ?
» Is it not to divide your bread with the hungry and bring the homeless poor into the house ? When you see the naked , should you cover him and not hide yourself from your own flesh ?
» Your light will break out like the dawn . Your recovery will speedily spring forth . Your righteousness will go before you and the glory of Jehovah will be your rear guard .
» ‘ Then you will call , and Jehovah will answer ! You will cry and he will say : ‘ Here I am . ’ ’ If you remove the yoke from your midst , the pointing of the finger and speaking wickedness ,
and if you give yourself to the hungry and satisfy the desire of the afflicted , then your light will rise in darkness and your gloom will be like midday .
Jehovah will continually guide you . He will satisfy your desire in scorched places and give strength to your bones . You will be like a watered garden and like a spring of water whose waters do not fail .
Those among you will rebuild the ancient ruins . You will raise up the age-old foundations . You will be called the repairer of the breach , the restorer of the streets in which to dwell .
» If because of the Sabbath , you turn your foot from doing your pleasure on my holy day , and you call the Sabbath a delight and the holy of Jehovah honorable , and honor it , desisting from your ways , from seeking your own pleasure and speaking your own word ,
» you will take delight in Jehovah ! I will make you ride on the heights of the earth . I will feed you the heritage of Jacob your father . The mouth of Jehovah has spoken ! «
The hand of Jehovah is not too weak to save or his ear too deaf to hear .
But your wrongs have separated you from your God . Your sins have made him hide his face so that he does not even hear you .
Your hands are defiled with blood , and your fingers are desecrated with sin . You speak lies , and you mutter wicked things .
No one calls for justice and no one pleads his case truthfully . People trust pointless arguments and speak lies . They conceive trouble and give birth to evil .
They hatch viper eggs and weave spider webs . Those who eat their eggs will die . When an egg is crushed , a poisonous snake is hatched .
Their webs cannot be used for clothes . They cannot cover themselves with their works for their works are evil . Their hands have committed acts of violence .
Their feet run to do evil . They hurry to shed innocent blood . Their thoughts are evil . Ruin and destruction are on their highways .
They do not know the way of peace . There is no justice on their highways . They made their paths crooked . Those who walk on them will never know peace .
That is why justice is far from us , and righteousness does not reach us . We hope for light and we walk in darkness . We hope for brightness but we walk in gloom .
We grope like blind men along a wall . We grope like people without eyes . We stumble at noon as if it were evening . We are like dead people among the living .
We all growl like bears . We coo like doves . We hope for justice , but there is none . We hope for salvation , but it is far from us .
You are aware of our many rebellious acts . Our sins testify against us . Our rebellious acts are with us . We know our iniquities .
We rebelled and denied Jehovah . We turned away from our God . We spoke about oppression and revolt . We conceived and uttered lies in our hearts .
Justice is turned back , and righteousness stands far away . Truth has fallen in the street , and honesty cannot come in .
Truth is missing . Those who turn away from evil become victims . Jehovah sees it , and what he saw displeased him because there is no justice .
He sees that there is no one to help . He is astounded that there is no one to intercede . So he saves him with his own power . His righteousness supports him .
He puts on righteousness like a coat of armor and a helmet of salvation on his head . He wears clothes of vengeance . He wraps himself with zeal as a coat .
He will pay them back according to their deeds . He will pay back his opponents with wrath and punish his enemies . He will pay back the people who live on the coastlands .
The people from the sunset the west will respect the name of Jehovah . Those from the rising of the sun the east will reverence his glory . He will come like a rushing stream that the Spirit wind breath of Jehovah drives .
» A Savior will come to Zion , to those in Jacob who turn from sin , declares Jehovah .
» This is my promise to them , « says Jehovah . » My Spirit is on you and my words that I put in your mouth will not leave you . They will be with your children and your grandchildren permanently , « says Jehovah
» Arise O woman and shine ! Your light has come , and the glory of Jehovah beams on you .
» Darkness now covers the earth ! Thick darkness overwhelms the nations . But Jehovah shines for you . His glory appears to you .
» Nations will come to your light . Kings will come to the brightness of your illumination .
» Look up , look around , and watch . All of your people assemble and come to you . Your sons come from far away . Your daughters are carried in their arms .
» Then you will see this and rejoice . Your heart will shake with joy . The riches of the sea will be brought to you . The wealth of the nations will come to you .
» Many camels will cover your land , young camels from Midian and Ephah . Everyone from Sheba will come . They will bring gold and incense . They will sing the praises of Jehovah .
» All of the flocks from Kedar will gather and come to you . The rams of Nebaioth will serve you . They will be sacrificed as acceptable offerings on my altar . So I will honor my beautiful Temple .
» Who are these people that fly by like clouds and like doves to their nests ?
» Surely the coastlands wait with hope for me . The ships from Tarshish are the first to bring your children from far away . They bring their silver and their gold with them to honor the name of Jehovah your God , the Holy One of Israel , because he has honored you .
» Foreigners will rebuild your walls , and their kings will serve you . I struck you because of my anger , but in my favor I have compassion on you .
» Your gates will always be open . They will never be closed day or night so that people may bring you the wealth of the nations . Even their kings are led as prisoners .
» Nations and kingdoms that do not serve you will be destroyed . The nations will definitely be ruined .
» Lebanon's glory will come to you : Cedar , fir , and cypress trees will come to beautify my holy place . I will honor the place where my feet rest .
» The sons of those who oppress you will bow in front of you . All who loathe you will bow at your feet . They will call you the city of Jehovah , Zion , the city of the Holy One of Israel .
» You have been abandoned and hated . No one has passed through you . But now I will make you a foundation of everlasting pride , a joy for all generations .
» You will drink milk from other nations and nurse at royal breasts . Then you will know that I am Jehovah , your Savior , the Mighty One of Jacob , and your Defender Protector .
» I will bring gold instead of copper . I will bring silver instead of iron , copper instead of wood , and iron instead of stone . I will appoint peace as your governor and righteousness as your ruler .
» You will no longer hear about violence in your land or desolation and destruction within your borders . You will call your walls Salvation and your gates Praise .
» The sun will no longer be your light during the day . The brightness of the moon will not give you light , for Jehovah will be your everlasting light . Your God will be your glory .
» Your sun will no longer go down , nor will your moon disappear . Jehovah will be your everlasting light , and your days of sadness will be over .
» Then all your people will be righteous and they will possess the land everlastingly . They will be the seedlings I have planted , the honored work of my hands .
» The smallest of them will become a thousand . The weakest of them will become a mighty nation . At the right time I , Jehovah , will make it happen quickly . «
The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah is upon me , because Jehovah has anointed me to announce good news to the lowly and meek . He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted , to proclaim liberty to captives and freedom to prisoners .
To proclaim the favorable Year of Jehovah and the day of vengeance of our God . To comfort all who mourn ,
to present a garland , instead of ashes , to those who mourn in Zion , the oil of gladness instead of mourning , and the mantle of praise instead of a spirit of fainting . They will be called oaks of righteousness . They are the planting of Jehovah , that he may be glorified .
They will rebuild the ancient ruins . They will raise up the former devastations . And they will repair the ruined cities , the desolations of many generations .
» Strangers will stand and shepherd your flocks . Foreigners will be your farmers and your vinedressers .
» You will be called the priests of Jehovah . You will be spoken of as ministers of our God . You will eat the wealth of nations , you will boast in their riches .
» Instead of your shame there will be a double portion . Instead of humiliation they will shout for joy over their portion . Therefore they will possess a double portion in their land . Everlasting joy will be theirs .
» For I , Jehovah , love justice . I hate robbery in the burnt offering . Therefore I will faithfully give them their recompense and make an everlasting covenant with them .
» Then their offspring will be known among the nations , and their descendants in the midst of the peoples . All who see them will recognize them because they are the blessed offspring of Jehovah . «
I will rejoice greatly in Jehovah . I will exult in my God for he has clothed me with garments of salvation . He has wrapped me with a robe of righteousness , as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland , and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels .
For as the earth brings forth its sprouts , and as a garden causes the things sown in it to spring up , the Lord Jehovah will cause righteousness and praise to spring up before all the nations .
For Zion's sake I will not remain silent . For Jerusalem's sake I will not rest until its righteousness shines like the sunrise and its salvation burns brightly like a torch .
» The nations will see your righteousness . All kings will see your glory . You will be given a new name that Jehovah will designate .
» You will be a beautiful crown in the hand of Jehovah , a royal crown in the hand of your God .
» You will no longer be called » Deserted , « and your land will no longer be called » Destroyed . « You will be named » My Delight . « Your land will be named » Married « owned as a wife . Jehovah is delighted with you , and your land will be married .
» Your sons will marry you like a young man marries a woman . Your God will rejoice over the same way a bridegroom rejoices over his bride .
» I have posted watchmen on your walls , O Jerusalem . They will never be silent day or night . Whoever calls on Jehovah , do not allow yourselves any rest ,
and do not give him any rest until he establishes Jerusalem and makes it an object of praise throughout the earth . «
Jehovah has sworn with his right hand and with his mighty arm of power : » I will never again let your enemies eat your grain , nor will foreigners drink the new wine that you produced .
» Those who harvest grain will eat it and praise Jehovah . Those who gather grapes will drink wine in my holy courtyards . «
Pass through ! Pass through the gates ! Prepare a way for the people ! Build up ! Build up the highway ! Clear away the stones ! Raise a flag standard for the people !
Jehovah has announced to the ends of the earth : » Tell my people , Zion , your salvation is coming . His reward for us and recompense are with him . ’ «
They will be called the holy people reclaimed repurchased by Jehovah ! You will be called » searched for , « a » City Not Deserted . «
Who is this coming from Bozrah in Edom with his clothes stained bright red ? Who is this dressed in splendor , going forward with great strength ? It is I , Jehovah ! I am coming to announce my victory . I am powerful enough to save you !
Why are your clothes red and your garments like those who trample grapes in a winepress ?
» I have trampled alone in the winepress . No one was with me . In my anger I trampled on people . In my wrath I stomped on them . Their blood splattered my clothes so all my clothing has been stained .
» The day of vengeance was in my heart . The year for my reclaiming you has come .
» I looked , but there was no help . I was astounded that there was no outside support . So my own arm power brought me salvation . My anger supported me .
» In my wrath I trampled on people . In my rage I made them drunk and poured their blood on the ground . «
I will acknowledge Jehovah’s acts of loving-kindness , and sing the praises of Jehovah , because of everything that Jehovah has done for us . He has done many good things for the nation of Israel because of his compassion and the abundance of his loving-kindness .
He said : They are my people , sons who will not lie to me . So he became their Savior .
In all their difficulty he was concerned , and he was the messenger who saved them . In his love and compassion he reclaimed redeemed them . He always held them and carried them in the past .
But they rebelled and grieved offended and hurt his Holy Spirit . So he turned against them as their enemy . He fought against them .
His people finally remembered Moses and the days of old . Where is the one who brought them out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock ? Where is the one who put his Holy Spirit in the midst of them ?
Where is the one who sent his powerful arm to support the right hand of Moses ? Where is the one who divided the water in front of them to make an everlasting name for himself ?
Where is the one who led them through the deep water ? Like horses in the wilderness , they did not stumble .
Just like animals going down into a valley , they were given rest by Jehovah’s Spirit . In this way you guided your people to make an honored name for yourself .
Look down and see from heaven , from your holy and beautiful dwelling . Where is your determination zeal and might ? Where is the longing of your heart and your compassion ? Do not hold back .
You are our Father . Even though Abraham does not know us and Israel does not pay attention to us , O Jehovah , you are our Father . Your name is our Defender From Everlasting .
O Jehovah , why do you let us wander from your ways and become so stubborn that we are unable to respect you ? Return for the sake of your servants . They are the tribes that belong to you .
Your holy people possessed the land for a little while . Our enemies have trampled on your holy place .
We have become like those whom you never ruled , like those who are not called by your name .
O that you would split open the heavens and come down ! The mountains would quake at your presence .
Be like the fire that kindles brushwood and makes water boil . Come down to make your name known to your enemies . The nations may tremble in your presence .
When you did awe-inspiring things that we did not expect , you came down and the mountains quaked at your presence .
No one has ever heard and no one has paid attention . No one has perceived any god except you . You help those who wait for you .
You greeted the one who gladly does right and remembers your ways . You were angry because we sinned . We continued to sin for a long time . Can we still be saved ?
All of us have become unclean , and all our righteous acts are like permanently stained rags . All of us wither like leaves , and our sins carry us away like the wind .
No one calls on your name or tries to hold on to you . You have hidden your face from us . You allowed us be ruined by our sins .
But now , Jehovah , you are our Father . We are the clay , and you are our potter . We are the work of your hands .
Do not be too angry , Jehovah . Do not remember our sin forever . Now look , we are all your people .
Your holy cities have become a wilderness . Zion has become a desert . Jerusalem is a wasteland .
Our holy and beautiful Temple where our ancestors praised you has been burned to the ground . All that we valued has been ruined .
Despite these things , Jehovah , will you restrain yourself ? Will you be silent and make us suffer beyond measure ?
» I permitted myself to be sought by those who did not ask for me . Those who did not seek me found me . To a nation that did not call on my name , I said : ‘ Here I am , here I am . ’
» All day long I held out my hands to an obstinate people , who walk in ways not good , pursuing their own imaginations thoughts ,
» a people who continually provoke me to my very face , offering sacrifices in gardens and burning incense on altars of brick .
» They sit among the graves and spend their nights keeping secret vigil . They eat the flesh of pigs . Their pots are full of unclean meat .
» ‘ They say : ‘ Keep away ! Do not come near me , for I am too sacred for you ! Such people are smoke in my nostrils , a fire that keeps burning all day . ’
» See , it stands written before me . I will not keep silent but will pay back in full ; I will pay it back into their laps
both your sins and the sins of your fathers , says Jehovah . This is because they burned sacrifices on the mountains and defied me on the hills . I will measure into their laps the full payment for their former deeds . «
Jehovah says : » As when juice is still found in a cluster of grapes and men say , ‘ Do not destroy it , there is yet some good in it , ’ ’ so will I do in behalf of my servants ; I will not destroy them all .
I will bring forth offspring from Jacob , and from Judah those who will possess my mountains . My chosen people will inherit them and my servants will live there .
Sharon will be pasture for flocks , and the Valley of Achor a resting place for herds , for my people who seek me .
» But as for you who forsake Jehovah and forget my holy mountain , which spread a table for the God of Fortune Babylonian diety and fill bowls of mixed wine for Destiny ,
» I will destine you for the sword , and you will all bend down for the slaughter ! I called but you did not answer . I spoke but you did not listen . You did evil in my sight and chose what displeases me . «
Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says : My servants will eat , but you will go hungry . My servants will drink , but you will go thirsty . My servants will rejoice , but you will be put to shame !
My servants will sing out of the joy of their hearts , but you will cry out from anguish of heart and wail in brokenness of spirit .
You will leave your name to my chosen ones as a curse . The Sovereign Lord Jehovah will put you to death , but to his servants he will give another name .
Whoever invokes a blessing in the land will do so by the God of amen , so be it truth ; he who takes an oath in the land will swear by the God of truth . For the past troubles will be forgotten and hidden from my eyes .
» Behold ! I WILL CREATE A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW EARTH . The former things will not be remembered , nor will they come to mind .
» Be glad and rejoice forever in what I will create , for I will create Jerusalem to be a delight and its people a joy .
» I will rejoice over Jerusalem and take delight in my people . The sound of weeping and of crying will be heard in it no more . «
» Never again will there be in it an infant who lives but a few days , or an old man who does not live out his years . He who dies at a hundred will be thought a mere youth . The sinner who reaches a hundred will be considered accursed .
» They will build houses and dwell in them . They will plant vineyards and eat their fruit .
» No longer will they build houses and others live in them , or plant and others eat . For as the days of a tree , so will be the days of my people . My chosen ones will long enjoy the works of their hands .
» They will not toil in vain or bear children doomed to misfortune . For they will be a people blessed by Jehovah , they and their descendants with them .
» Before they call I will answer ! While they are still speaking I will hear .
» The wolf and the lamb will feed together , and the lion will eat straw like the bull , but dust will be the serpent’s food . They will neither harm nor destroy on my entire holy mountain , « Jehovah proclaims .
This is what Jehovah says : » Heaven is my throne . Earth is my footstool . Where can you people build a house or resting place for me ?
» I have made all these things . That is why all these things have come into being , « declares Jehovah . » I will pay attention to those who are humble and sorry for their sins and who tremble at my word .
» Whoever kills a bull is like someone who kills a person . Whoever sacrifices a lamb is like someone who breaks a dog's neck . Whoever offers a grain sacrifice is like someone who offers pig's blood . Whoever burns incense is like someone who worships an idol . People have certainly chosen their own ways , and they delight in detestable things .
» Therefore I will choose harsh treatment for them and bring on them what they fear . I called , but no one answered . I spoke , but they did not listen . They did what I consider evil . They chose what I do not like . «
» Listen to the word of Jehovah , all who tremble at his word . Your brothers , who hate you , exclude you because of my name . They say : Let Jehovah show his glory and then we will see your joy . But they will be put to shame .
» Listen to the uproar from the city . Listen to the sound from the temple . It is the sound of Jehovah paying back his enemies as they deserve .
» Before a woman goes into labor , she gives birth . Before she has labor pains , she delivers a male child .
» Who has heard of such a thing ? Who has seen such things ? Can a country be born in one day ? Can a nation be born in a moment ? When Zion went into labor , she also gave birth to her sons .
» Do I bring a mother to the moment of birth and not let her deliver ? « Asks Jehovah . » Do I cause a mother to deliver and then make her unable to have children ? « Asks your God .
» All who love Jerusalem , be happy and rejoice with her . All who mourn for her be glad with her .
» You will nurse and be satisfied from her comforting breasts . You will nurse and be satisfied at her full breasts . «
This is what Jehovah says : » I will offer you peace like a river and the wealth of the nations like an overflowing stream . You will nurse and be carried in Jerusalem's arms and cuddled on her knees .
» As a mother comforts her child , so I will comfort you . You will be comforted in Jerusalem . «
When you see it , your heart will rejoice and you will flourish like new grass . The power of Jehovah will be made known to his servants , but he will condemn his enemies .
Jehovah will come with fire and with his chariots like a thunderstorm . He will pay them back with his burning anger and punish them with flames of fire .
Jehovah will judge with fire , and he will judge all people with his sword . Jehovah will strike many people dead .
» People make themselves holy and prepare themselves for their garden rituals . They go into the garden and devour pork , disgusting things , and mice . They will come to an end at the same time , declares Jehovah .
» Because of their actions and their thoughts , I am coming to gather the nations of every language . They will come and see my glory .
» I will set up a sign among them and send some of their survivors to the nations : to Tarshish , Put and Lud , Meshech , Rosh , Tubal , Javan , and to the distant coastlands who have not heard of my fame or seen my glory . They will tell about my glory among the nations .
They will bring all your brothers from every nation like a grain offering to Jehovah . They will come on horses , in chariots , in wagons , on mules and camels to my holy mountain , Jerusalem , declares Jehovah . They will come like the people of Israel who bring their grain offerings in clean dishes to Jehovah’s temple .
» I will make some of them priests and Levites , declares Jehovah .
» The new heaven and earth that I am about to make will continue in my presence , « declares Jehovah . » So your descendants and your name will also continue in my presence .
» From one month to the next and from one week to the next all people will come to worship me , « declares Jehovah .
» Then they will go out and look at the corpses of those who have rebelled sinned against me . The worms that eat them will not die . The fire that burns them will not go out and they will disgust all humanity . «
The words of Jeremiah , son of Hilkiah . He was one of the priests at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin .
Jehovah spoke his word to Jeremiah . This happened when King Josiah , son of Amon , was in his thirteenth year as king of Judah .
Jehovah also spoke when Jehoiakim , son of Josiah , was king of Judah . It was during the eleven years that Zedekiah , another son of Josiah , was king of Judah . Jehovah continued to speak to Jeremiah until the people of Jerusalem were taken away into captivity in the fifth month of the year .
Jehovah spoke his word to me , Jeremiah , He said :
» Before I formed you in the womb , I knew you . Before you were born , I set you apart for my holy purpose . I appointed you to be a prophet to the nations . «
I , Jeremiah , said : » Lord Jehovah , I do not know how to speak . I am only a child ! «
Jehovah said to me : » ‘ Do not say , ‘ I am only a child . ’ ’ You must go wherever I send you . You must say whatever I command you to say .
» Do not be afraid of people . I am with you . I will rescue you , « says Jehovah .
Then Jehovah stretched out his hand and touched my mouth . Jehovah said to me : » I have put my words in your mouth .
» Today I have appointed you in charge of nations and kingdoms . You will uproot and tear down . You will destroy and overthrow . You will build and plant . «
Jehovah spoke his word to me again . He asked : » What do you see Jeremiah ? « I answered : » I see a branch of an almond tree . «
Jehovah said : » You are right . For I watch to make sure that my words come true . «
Again Jehovah asked : » What do you see ? « I answered : » I see a boiling pot , and its top is tilted away from the north . «
Jehovah said to me : » Disaster will be poured out from the north on all those who live in the land .
» I am going to call every family and kingdom from the north , says Jehovah . They will come , and they will set up their thrones at the entrance of Jerusalem's gates . They will attack all the walls around the city and all the cities of Judah .
» I will pronounce judgment against my people because of all their wickedness . They abandoned me . They burned incense to other gods . They worshiped what their hands have made .
» Strengthen yourself , Jeremiah ! Stand up , and say to them whatever I tell you to say . Do not be terrified in their presence , or I will make you even more terrified in their presence .
» Today I have made you like a fortified city , an iron pillar , and a copper wall . You will be able to stand up to the whole land . You will be able to stand up to Judah's kings , its officials , its priests , and all the common people .
» They will fight you but they will not defeat you . I am with you , and I will rescue you , « declares Jehovah .
Jehovah spoke his word to me :
» Go and announce to Jerusalem , ‘ This is what Jehovah says : » I remember the unfailing loyalty of your youth , the love you had for me as a bride . I remember how you followed me into the desert , into a land that was not sown farmed .
» ‘ » Israel was dedicated consecrated to Jehovah . It was the best part of the harvest . All who consumed it became guilty , and disaster struck them , « ’ « says Jehovah .
Listen to the word of Jehovah , offspring of Jacob , all the families in the house of Israel .
Jehovah says : » What bad thing injustice did your fathers find in me that they went so far away from me ? They followed worthless idols and became worthless lead astray themselves .
» They did not ask : ‘ Where is Jehovah who brought us from Egypt ? He led us through the desert , through a wasteland and its pits , a land of drought and the shadow of death . No one lives there or travels there . ’
» I brought you into a fertile land to eat its fruit and its produce . You came and made my land unclean . You made my heritage disgusting .
» ‘ The priests did not ask : ‘ Where is Jehovah ? Those who deal with my Law did not know me . The rulers rebelled against me . The prophets prophesied in the name of Baal and followed things that could not help profit them . ’ «
» That is why I will bring charges against you , proclaims Jehovah , and I will bring charges against your grandchildren .
» Go over to the coasts of Cyprus Kittim , and see . Send someone to Kedar and observe closely . See if there has ever been such a thing as this .
» Has any nation ever exchanged gods ? Their gods are not really gods . Yet my people have exchanged their glory for something that does not help them .
» Be horrified over this , heaven . Be terribly afraid , « declares Jehovah .
» My people have done two things wrong : l They have abandoned me , the fountain source of living waters . They have dug their own cisterns , broken cisterns that cannot hold water .
» Are the people of Israel slaves ? Were they born into slavery ? Why , then , have they become someone's property ?
» Young lions have roared at them . Young lions have turned the land into waste . The cities have been destroyed , without inhabitant .
» Men from Noph Memphis , capital city of Egypt and Tahpanhes have shaved the crown of your head , Israel .
» You have done this to yourself by abandoning Jehovah your God when he led you on his way .
» Why are you going to Egypt to drink water from the Nile Shihor River ? You will not gain anything by going to Assyria to drink water from the Euphrates River .
» Your own wickedness will correct you . Your apostasies unfaithful ways will punish you ! You should know and see how evil and bitter it is for you when you abandon Jehovah your God ! You do not respect reverence me , « says the Sovereign Lord Jehovah of Hosts .
» Long ago you broke off your yoke , tore off your bonds , and said that you would not be a slave . You lay down and acted like a prostitute on every high hill and under every large tree .
» I planted you like a choice grapevine from the very best seed . Now you have turned against me and have become a wild vine .
» If you wash with detergent and use a lot of soap , I would still see the stains from your wickedness , « says the Lord Jehovah .
» How can you say , ‘ I have not been dishonored and have not gone after the Baal gods ? ’ ’ » Look how you have behaved in the valley . Acknowledge what you have done . You are like a young camel that swiftly runs here and there .
» You are like a wild donkey accustomed to the desert . You sniff at the wind while in heat . All who seek you will not get tired . They will find you during your monthly period .
» Do not run until your feet are bare and your throats are dry . But you say that it is useless . You love foreign gods and follow them .
» As a thief feels ashamed when he is caught , so the nation of Israel will feel ashamed . Their kings , princes , priests , and prophets will also feel ashamed .
» You call wood your father . You call stone your mother . You turned your backs , not your faces , to me . But when you are in trouble , you ask me to come and rescue you .
» Where are the gods that you made for yourselves ? Let them come and rescue you when you have trouble . You have as many gods as you have cities , Judah !
» Why do you complain about me ? You have rebelled against me , « proclaims Jehovah .
» I have punished your children without results . They did not respond to correction . You killed my prophets like a raging lion .
» O you people of this generation consider the word of Jehovah ! Have I been a wilderness , a land of thick darkness , for Israel ? Why do my people say that they are free to wander around and no longer come to me ?
» A young woman cannot forget her jewelry or a bride her breastband sash girdle . Yet , my people have forgotten me for countless days .
» You carefully planned ways to look for love . You taught your ways to wicked women .
» You have bloodstains from innocent poor people on your clothes . You did not kill them for breaking in to your home .
» ‘ After all this you say : ‘ I am innocent . God will turn his anger from me . For I have not sinned . ’ «
» You change your mind so easily . You will be shamed by Egypt as you were shamed by Assyria .
» You will also leave this place with your hands over your head , because Jehovah has rejected those you trust . They will not help you . «
It is said : » If a man divorces his wife and she leaves him and marries another man , her first husband should not go back to her again . « The land would become completely polluted . » You have behaved like a prostitute who has many lovers . Now you want to come back to me ! « Says Jehovah .
» Lift up your eyes to the bare hills and see . You have had sex with men in every place . You sat by the roadside waiting for them like a nomad in the desert . You have defiled corrupted profaned the land with your prostitution and wickedness .
» Accordingly the rain has been withheld , and there have been no spring showers . Yet , you have the unashamed conspicuous impudent look of a prostitute , and you refuse to be ashamed .
» ‘ Now you call to me . You say , ‘ Father ! ’ ’ » You have been my friend ever since I was young .
» Will you hold a grudge forever ? Will you always be angry ? You have said and done all the evil things that you could . «
During the reign of King Josiah , Jehovah asked me : » Did you see what unfaithful Israel did ? She went up every high mountain and under every large tree , and she acted like a prostitute there .
» I thought that after she had done all this she would come back to me . But she did not come back , and her treacherous unstable unreliable false sister Judah saw her .
» Judah saw that I sent unfaithful Israel away because of her adultery and that I gave Israel her divorce papers . But treacherous Judah , her sister , was not afraid . She also acted like a prostitute .
» Because she was not concerned about her prostitution . She polluted the land and committed adultery with stone and wood .
» Even after all this , Israel's treacherous sister Judah did not return to me with all her heart . She was deceitful , « says Jehovah .
Jehovah said to me : » Treacherous Judah was more reprehensible than unfaithful Israel .
» ‘ Go and proclaim this message to the north : ‘ Come back , unfaithful Israel . It is Jehovah speaking . I will no longer frown on you because I am merciful , ’ ’ declares Jehovah . ‘ I will no longer be angry with you .
‘ Admit that you have done wrong ! You have rebelled against Jehovah your God . You have given yourself to foreign gods under every large tree . You have not obeyed me , ’ ’ says Jehovah .
‘ Return , you disobedient people , proclaims Jehovah . I am your husband . I will take you , one from every city and two from every family , and bring you to Zion . ’
» I will give you shepherds after my own heart . They will be shepherds who feed shepherd lead tend you with knowledge and understanding learning reasoning insight .
» In those days you will be fertile , and your population will increase in the land , says Jehovah . Men will no longer talk about the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah . It will no longer come to mind . They will not remember it , miss it , or make another one .
» At that time , they will call Jerusalem the throne of Jehovah . All nations will gather in Jerusalem because the name of Jehovah will be found there . They will no longer follow their own stubborn , evil ways .
» Then the nation of Judah will live with the nation of Israel . They will come together from the land of the north to the land that I gave their ancestors as their own inheritance .
» I wanted to treat you like children and give you a pleasant land , the most beautiful property among the nations . I thought you would call me Father and not turn away from me .
» But like a wife who is unfaithful to her husband , so you , O house of Israel , were unfaithful me , « says Jehovah .
A voice is heard on the bare hills . It is the crying and the pleading of the people of Israel . They are perverted and have forgotten Jehovah their God .
» Return you backsliding children , and I will forgive you for being unfaithful . See , we have come to you because you are Jehovah our God .
» Truly the sound from the hills and mountains is the noise of false worship . Truly Jehovah our God will be our salvation .
» Ever since we were young , the shameful worship of Baal has taken everything our ancestors worked for , their flocks and herds , their sons and daughters .
» We must lie down in our shame and let our humiliation cover us . Ever since we were young , we and our fathers have sinned against Jehovah our God . We have not obeyed Jehovah our God . «
Jehovah says : » If you come back , Israel , if you come back to me , if you take your disgusting idols out of my sight and you do not stray from me ,
if you take the oath , as Jehovah lives in an honest , fair , and right way , then the nations will be blessed , and in him they will glory . «
Jehovah says to the people of Judah and to Jerusalem : » Break up your unplowed fields , and do not plant among thorns .
» Be circumcised by Jehovah , and get rid of the foreskins of your hearts cleanse your hearts , people of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem . If you do not , my fury will blaze like a fire . It will burn , and no one will be able to put it out . This is because of the evil you do . «
Report this message in Judah . Make it heard in Jerusalem . Say : » Blow the ram's horn throughout the land . Shout loudly and say : ‘ Assemble together ! Let us go into the fortified cities . ’
» Raise the flag to signal people to go to Zion . Take cover ! Do not just stand there ! I am bringing disaster and widespread destruction from the north .
» A lion has come out of its lair . A destroyer of nations has set out . He has left his place and is on his way to destroy your land . Your cities will be ruined . No one will live in them .
» Dress in sackcloth , beat your breasts mourn , and cry because Jehovah’s burning anger has not turned back from us .
» In that day , « declares Jehovah , » the king and the officials will lose their courage . The priests will be stunned . The prophets will be amazed and astonished . «
I said , » Lord Jehovah , you have greatly deceived these people and Jerusalem . You said that everything would go well for them , but a sword is held at their throats threatens their lives . «
Then it will be said to these people and to Jerusalem : » A hot wind from the heights will blow in the desert toward my people . It will not be a wind that winnows or cleanses .
» It will be a stronger wind than that . It will come from me . Now , I will pass sentence on them .
» The enemy comes up like clouds . His chariots are like a raging wind . His horses are swifter than eagles . How horable it will be for us ! We will be destroyed ! «
» O Jerusalem , wash the evil from your heart so that you may be saved . How long will your wicked thoughts lodge within you ?
» A message is heard from Dan . A report of disaster comes from the mountains of Ephraim .
» Warn the nations about this . Tell it to Jerusalem . Hostile troops are coming from a distant country . They shout battle cries against the cities of Judah . «
» They surround Judah like men guarding a field , because Judah has rebelled against me , « declares Jehovah .
» You brought this on yourself . This is your punishment . It is bitter . It breaks your heart . «
O my anguish , my anguish ! I writhe in pain . My heart pounds in side of me . My heart is pounding ! I cannot keep quiet because I hear a ram's horn sounding the alarm for war .
Destruction upon destruction is proclaimed . The whole land is ruined . My tents are suddenly destroyed . Their curtains are torn in an instant .
How long must I see the battle flag and hear the sound of rams' horns ?
» My people are fools . They do not know me . They are stupid people . They do not understand . They are experts in doing wrong , and they do not know how to do good . «
I see the earth . It is without form and empty . I see the sky . Its lights are gone .
I see the mountains . They tremble and the hills sway .
I see that there are no people , and every bird has flown away .
I see that the fertile land has become a desert . Its cities are torn down because of Jehovah and his burning anger .
Jehovah says : » The whole earth will be ruined , although I will not entirely destroy it .
» The earth will mourn , and the sky will grow black . I have spoken , and I have determined it . I will not change my plans , and I will not turn back ! «
All the people in the city will flee at the sound of riders and archers . They will go off into the thickets and climb among the rocks . The entire city will be abandoned . No one will live in it .
You are going to be destroyed ! What are you going to do ? Why do you dress in scarlet crimson and put on gold jewelry ? Why do you wear eye shadow ? You are making yourself beautiful for nothing . Your lovers despise you . They want to kill you .
I hear a woman in labor . I hear the woman cry with anguish as she gives birth to her first child . My people Zion gasp for breath . They stretch out their hands and say : » How horrible it is for us ! My life is exhausted by the presence of murderers ! «
People of Jerusalem , run through your streets ! Look around and see for yourselves ! Search the marketplaces ! Can you find one person who does what is right and tries to be faithful to God ? If you can , Jehovah will forgive Jerusalem .
Even though you claim to worship Jehovah , you do not mean what you say .
Jehovah looks for faithfulness . He struck you , but you paid no attention . He crushed you , but you refused to learn . You were stubborn and would not turn from your sins .
I thought : » These are only the poor and ignorant . They a foolish . They do not know what their God requires , what Jehovah wants them to do .
» I will go to the great men leaders and talk with them . Surely they know what their God requires , what Jehovah wants them to do . But all of them have rejected Jehovah’s authority and refuse to obey him . «
That is why lions from the forest will kill them . Wolves from the desert will tear them to pieces , and leopards will prowl through their towns . If those people go out , they will be torn apart because their sins are numerous and time after time they have turned from God .
Jehovah asked : Why should I forgive the sins of my people ? They have abandoned me and have worshiped gods that are not real . I fed my people until they were full , but they committed adultery and spent their time with prostitutes .
They were like well-fed stallions wild with desire , each lusting for his neighbor's wife .
» Why should I not punish the people of Judah ? « Says Jehovah , » Should I take retribution vengeance ? «
» Go up through her vineyards and destroy them . But do not execute a complete destruction . Strip away her branches , for they are not Jehovah’s .
» The house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously with me , « says Jehovah .
They lied about Jehovah . They said : » It is not he , bad things will not happen to us . We will not see sword or famine . «
» The prophets are as wind ! The word is not in them . Thus it will be done to them ! «
Jehovah , the God of hosts says : » Because you have spoken this word and I am making my words fire in your mouth . This people are wood and will be consumed .
» I am bringing a nation against you from afar , O house of Israel , declares Jehovah . It is an enduring nation . It is an ancient nation , a nation whose language you do not know . You cannot understand comprehend make sense of what they say .
» Their quiver is like an open grave . All of them are mighty men .
» They will devour your harvest and your food . They will devour your sons and your daughters . They will devour your flocks and your herds . They will devour your vines and your fig trees . They will demolish with the sword your fortified cities in which you trust .
» Yet even in those days , says Jehovah , I will not make you a complete destruction .
» ‘ They will ask : ‘ Why has Jehovah our God done all this to us ? ’ ’ Answer them : » You have abandoned me and served foreign gods in your land . So you will serve foreigners in a land that is not yours . « ’ «
» Declare this to the house of Jacob , and make this heard in Judah :
» ‘ Hear this , you stupid and senseless people ! You have eyes , but you cannot see . You have ears , but you cannot hear . ’ «
» Do you not reverence respect me ? « Asks Jehovah . » Do you not tremble with awe in my presence ? I made the sand a boundary for the sea , a permanent barrier it cannot cross . Although the waves toss continuously , they cannot break through . Although they roar , they cannot cross it .
» These people are stubborn and rebellious . They have turned aside and departed from me .
» They do not say in their hearts , to themselves : ‘ We should respect Jehovah our God . He sends rain at the right time , the autumn rain and the spring rain . He makes sure that we have harvest seasons . ’ «
» Your wickedness has turned these things away . Your sins have kept good things away from you .
» Wicked men are found among my people . They lie in ambush like bird catchers . They set traps and catch men .
» Like cages filled with birds , their houses are filled with deceit . That is why they become powerful and rich .
» They grow big and fat . Their evil deeds have no limits . They have no respect for the rights of others . They have no respect for the rights of orphans . But they still prosper . They do not defend the rights of the poor .
» I will punish them for these things , « declares Jehovah . » I will punish these people !
» Something horrible and disgusting is happening in the land .
‘ Prophets prophesy falsehoods . Priests rule under the prophets' directions , and my people love this . But what will you do when the end comes ? ’ «
Flee for safety people of Benjamin . Run from the midst of Jerusalem ! Blow a ram’s horn in Tekoa and raise a signal over Beth-haccerem . Evil looks down from the north . There is great destruction .
I will destroy the beautiful and luxurious one , the daughter of Zion .
Shepherds and their flocks will come to her . They will pitch their tents around her . They will pasture each in his place .
Prepare for war against her . » Arise , and let us attack at noon . « » Woe to us , for the day declines is nearly over , for the shadows of the evening lengthen ! «
» Arise , and let us attack at night and destroy her palaces ! «
Jehovah of Hosts says : » Cut down trees and build up a siege against Jerusalem . This city should be punished , for there is only oppression in her .
» As a well pours out its water , so Jerusalem pours out her wickedness . Violence and destruction are heard in her . Sickness and wounds are ever before me .
» Be warned , O Jerusalem , I will be alienated from you . I will make you desolation , a land not inhabited . «
Jehovah of Hosts says : » They will thoroughly glean as the vine the remnant of Israel . Pass your hand again like a grape gatherer over the baskets . «
» To whom can I speak and give warning that they may hear ? Their ears are closed and they cannot listen . Behold , the word of Jehovah has become a reproach to them . They have no delight in it .
I am full of the wrath of Jehovah . I am weary with holding it in . Pour it out on the children in the street and on the gathering of young men together . For both husband and wife will be taken , the aged and the very old .
» Their houses , their fields and their wives will be turned over to others . I will stretch out my hand extend my power against the inhabitants of the land , « declares Jehovah .
» From the least of them even to the greatest of them , everyone is greedy for gain ! From the prophet even to the priest everyone deals falsely !
» ‘ Superficially they have healed the brokenness of my people . They declare : ‘ Peace ! Peace ! ’ ’ » But there is no peace . ’ «
» Are they ashamed because of the abomination they have done ? They are not even ashamed ! Not at all ! They do not even know how to blush . Therefore they will fall among those who fall . When I punish them , they will be cast down , « says Jehovah .
Jehovah says : » Stand by the way of life and see and ask for the ancient paths . Walk in the good way and you will find rest . « But you said : » We will not walk in it ! «
» ‘ I set watchmen over you . I said : ‘ Listen to the sound of the trumpet ! But they said : ‘ We will not listen ! ’ «
» Therefore hear , O nations , and know , O congregation , what is among them .
» Hear , O earth : behold , I am bringing disaster on this people as the fruit of their plans . This is because they have not listened to my words , and have rejected my law .
» What purpose does frankincense come to me from Sheba and the sweet cane from a distant land ? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable and your sacrifices are not pleasing to me . «
Therefore , Jehovah says : » I am laying stumbling blocks before this people . They will stumble against them , Fathers and sons together ; Neighbors and friends will perish . «
Jehovah says : » Behold , a people is coming from the northland ! A great nation will be aroused from the remote parts of the earth .
» They seize bow and spear . They are cruel and have no mercy . Their voice roars like the sea , and they ride on horses . They are arrayed as a man for the battle against you , O daughter of Zion ! «
We have heard the report ! Our hands are limp . Anguish has seized us ! We have pain like a woman in childbirth .
Do not go out into the field . Do not walk on the road . The enemy has a sword and terror is on every side .
O my people put on sackcloth and roll in ashes . Mourn as for an only son , a lamentation most bitter . For suddenly the destroyer will come upon us .
» I have made you an assayer and a tester among my people . You will know and assay their course of life . «
All of them are stubborn rebels . They go about telling false stories . They are copper and iron . They are all corrupt , all of them !
The bellows blow fiercely and the fire consumes the lead . The refining goes on in vain , but the wicked are not separated .
They call them rejected silver , for Jehovah has rejected them .
This is the word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah :
» Stand at the gate of Jehovah’s house and proclaim there this word : ‘ Hear the word of Jehovah , all you of Judah who enter by these gates to worship Jehovah !
» ‘ Thus says Jehovah of Hosts , the God of Israel : » Amend make right your ways and your deeds , and I will let you dwell in this place .
» ‘ » Do not trust in deceptive words . They say : ‘ This is the Temple of Jehovah , the Temple of Jehovah , and the Temple of Jehovah .
» ‘ » For if you truly amend your ways and your deeds , if you truly practice justice between a man and his neighbor ,
if you do not oppress the alien , the orphan , or the widow , and do not shed innocent blood in this place , nor walk after other gods to your own ruin ,
then I will let you dwell in this place , in the land I gave to your fathers from generation to generation and for a very long time . « ’ «
» You are trusting in deceptive words that are of no value to you .
» Will you steal , murder , commit adultery , swear falsely , offer sacrifices to Baal and walk after other gods that you have not known ?
» Then come and stand before me in this house . It is called by my name . You say , ‘ We are safe to do all these abominations . ’
» Has this house , called by my name , become a den of robbers in your sight ? Behold , I , even I , have seen it , « declares Jehovah .
» But go to my place in Shiloh , where I made my name dwell from the beginning , and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of my people Israel .
» For the reason that you did all these things , « says Jehovah , » I spoke to you . I rose up early and spoke . But you did not hear , and I called you but you did not answer .
» Consider what I will do to the house that is called by my name . It is the house in which you trust . It is the place I gave you and your fathers , as I did to Shiloh .
» I will cast you out of my sight , as I have cast out all your brothers , all the offspring of Ephraim .
» As for you , do not pray for this people . Do not lift up cry or prayer for them , and do not intercede with me for I do not hear you .
» Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ?
» The children gather wood , and the fathers kindle the fire . The women knead dough to make cakes for the queen of heaven . They pour out drink offerings to other gods in order to spite me .
» Do they spite me ? « Asks Jehovah . » Is it not themselves they spite , to their own shame ? «
Therefore the Lord Jehovah says : » My anger and my wrath will be poured out on this place , on man and on beast , on the trees of the field and on the fruit of the ground . It will burn and not be quenched . «
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts , the God of Israel : » Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices and eat flesh .
» For I did not speak to your fathers , or command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt , concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices .
» ‘ I gave them this command : ‘ Obey my voice , and I will be your God , and you will be my people . You will walk in all the way that I command you that it may be well with you . ’ «
» Yet they did not obey or incline their ear . They walked in their own counsels and in the stubbornness of their evil heart . They went backward and not forward .
» Since the day your fathers came out of the land of Egypt until this day , I have sent you all my servants the prophets , daily rising early and sending them .
» Yet they did not listen to me or incline their ear . Instead they stiffened their neck became stubborn . They did more evil than their fathers .
» You will speak all these words to them . But they will not listen to you . You will call them but they will not answer you .
» You will say to them : ‘ This is the nation that did not obey the voice of Jehovah their God or accept correction . Truth has perished and truth has been removed from their mouth .
‘ Cut off your hair and cast it away . Take up a cry of sorrow and grief on the bare heights . Jehovah has rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath . ’
» The sons of Judah have done what is evil in my sight , « declares Jehovah . » They placed their detestable things in the house called by my name , to defile it .
» They have built the high places of Topheth , which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom , to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire . I did not command this . I would never think of such a thing . It would not come from my heart .
» Days are coming , says Jehovah , when it will no longer be called Topheth , or the valley of the son of Hinnom Ben-hinnom , but the valley of the Slaughter . They will bury in Topheth because there is no other place .
» The dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the sky and for the beasts of the earth . No one will frighten them away .
» I will cause the voice of joy and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem . The land will become a ruin . «
Jehovah says : » At that time the bones of the kings and the leaders of Judah , the bones of the priests and the prophets , and the bones of the others who lived in Jerusalem will be taken out of their graves .
» They will be spread out and exposed to the sun , the moon , and all the stars in the sky . These are the things that they had loved , served , gone after , sought , and worshiped . Their bones will not be gathered or buried , but they will become manure on the ground .
» Then the few who remain from these wicked people will want to die rather than live where I will scatter them , declares Jehovah of Hosts .
» Say to them : ‘ This is what Jehovah says : » When someone falls , he gets back up . When someone turns away from me , he returns . « ’ «
» The people of Jerusalem turned away from me without ever returning . They still cling to deceit . They refuse to return .
» I paid attention and listened , but they were not honest . They do not turn away from their wickedness . They do not ask : ‘ What have we done ? ’ ’ They go their own ways like horses charging into battle . ’ «
» Even storks know when it is time to return . Mourning doves , swallows swifts , and cranes know when it is time to migrate . But my people do not know that I , Jehovah , am urging them to return .
» How can you say you are wise and that you have Jehovah’s Laws ? The scribes have used their pens to spread falsehoods .
» Wise people are put to shame , confused , and trapped . They have rejected the word of Jehovah . They do not really have any wisdom .
» So I will give their wives to other men . I will give their fields to new owners . From the least even to the greatest everyone is greedy for gain . From the prophet even to the priest everyone is deceitful .
» They heal the brokenness of the daughter of my people superficially . They say : ‘ Peace ! Peace ! ’ ’ But there is no peace .
» Were they ashamed because of the abomination they had done ? They certainly were not ashamed ! And they did not know how to blush . For that reason they will fall among those who fall . At the time of their punishment they will be brought down , « Says Jehovah .
» ‘ I will surely snatch them away , « declares Jehovah . » There will be no grapes on the vine and no figs on the fig tree . The leaf will wither and what I have given them will pass away . ’ «
» Why are we sitting still ? Assemble yourselves , and let us go into the fortified mother cities . Let us perish there , because Jehovah our God has doomed us . He has given us poisoned water to drink , for we have sinned against Jehovah .
We waited for peace , but no good came . We waited for a time of healing , but all we got was terror !
From Dan is heard the snorting of his horses . At the sound of the neighing of his stallions the whole land quakes . For they come and devour the land and its fullness , the city and its inhabitants .
» I am sending serpents against you , adders , for which there is no charm . They will bite you , « says Jehovah .
My sorrow is beyond healing , my heart is faint within me !
Behold , listen ! The cry of the daughter of my people from a distant land : » Is Jehovah not in Zion ? Is her King not within her ? « » Why have they provoked me with their graven images , with foreign idols ? «
» Harvest is past , summer is ended , and we are not saved . «
For the brokenness of the daughter of my people I am broken . I mourn and dismay has taken hold of me .
Is there no balm in Gilead ? Is there no physician healer there ? Why then has the health of the daughter of my people not been restored ?
Oh that my head were waters and my eyes a fountain of tears . Then I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people !
I wish I had a dwelling in the desert . I would abandon my people and go away from them . They are all adulterers , an assembly of treacherous men .
They bend their tongue like their bow . Lies and not truth prevail in the land . They move from evil to evil . » They do not know me , « says Jehovah .
» Let everyone be on guard against his neighbor . Do not trust any brother because every brother deals craftily cunningly , and every neighbor goes about as a slanderer .
» Everyone deceives his neighbor and does not speak the truth . They have taught their tongue to speak lies . They wear themselves out committing sin .
» You live in the middle of deceit . Through deceit they refuse to know me , « says Jehovah .
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts : » Behold , I will refine them and assay them . What else can I do , because of the daughter of my people ?
» Their tongue is a deadly arrow . It speaks deceit ! With the mouth one speaks peace to his neighbor , but inwardly he sets an ambush for him . «
» I will punish them for these things , « declares Jehovah . » I will punish this nation and I will not be satisfied . «
I will cry and weep for the mountains . I will sing a funeral song for the pastures in the wilderness . They are destroyed so that no one can travel through them . No one can hear the sound of cattle . Birds and cattle have fled . They are gone .
I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins . It will be a gathering place of jackals . I will make the cities of Judah desolation , without inhabitant .
» Who is the wise man that may understand this ? Who is he to whom the mouth of Jehovah has spoken ? Let him declare it ? Why is the land ruined , laid waste like a desert , so that no one passes through ? «
Jehovah said : » They have forsaken the Law I set before them . They have not obeyed my voice nor walked according to it .
» They have walked after the stubbornness of their heart and after the Baals as their fathers taught them .
» ‘ Therefore Jehovah of Hosts , the God of Israel says : ‘ Behold ! I will feed this people with wormwood and give them poisoned water to drink . ’
‘ I will scatter them among the nations , whom neither they nor their fathers have known . I will send the sword violence and warfare after them until I have annihilated them . ’
» Jehovah of Hosts says : ‘ Consider the mourning women that they may come . Send for the wailing women that they may come !
Let them hurry and take up a wailing for us . Let our eyes shed tears and our eyelids flow with water .
A voice of wailing is heard from Zion : » How we are ruined ! We are put to great shame for we have left the land , because they have cast down our dwellings . «
Listen to the word of Jehovah , you women , and open your ears to hear his words . Teach your daughters how to cry . Teach your neighbors funeral songs .
Death has come through our windows and entered our palaces . Death has cut down the children in the streets and the young men in the market places .
» ‘ This is what Jehovah says : » Dead bodies will fall like manure on the field . They will be like grain that has been cut but not gathered . « ’ «
This is what Jehovah says : » Do not let wise people brag about their wisdom . Do not let strong people brag about their strength . Do not let rich people brag about their riches . «
» If they want to brag , instead let them advocate glory celebrate that they understand and know me . They should advocate that I , Jehovah , act out of love , righteousness , and justice on the earth . This kind of celebration pleases me , « declares Jehovah .
» The days are coming , « proclaims Jehovah , » when I will punish all who are circumcised only in the flesh . Yet they are not circumcised in the heart .
» I will punish Egypt , Judah , Edom , Ammon , and Moab . I will punish all who shave the hair on their foreheads or live in the desert . Even though all these nations are uncircumcised , all Israel has uncircumcised hearts . «
Listen house of Israel , Hear the word Jehovah speaks to you .
This is what Jehovah says : » Do not learn the practices of the nations . Do not be frightened by the signs in the sky because they frighten the nations . «
The people’s customs are erroneous and empty . It is wood cut from the forest . It is the work of the hands of a craftsman with a cutting tool .
» They decorate it with silver and with gold . They fasten it with nails and with hammers so that it will not tip over .
» They are like scarecrows in cucumber fields . They cannot speak . They must be carried , for they cannot walk ! Do not fear them ! For they can do no harm and they can do no good . «
There is none like you , O Jehovah . You are great and your name is powerful .
Who would not respect you , O King of the nations ? It is your right ! There is none like you among all the wise men of the nations .
They are very stupid and foolish . They teach vanity to a tree . Their idol is wood !
Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish , and gold from Uphaz . It is the work of a craftsman and of the hands of a goldsmith . Violet and purple are their clothing . They are all the work of skilled men .
Jehovah is the true faithful right God ! He is the living God and the everlasting king . The earth quakes at his wrath . The nations cannot endure his indignation .
You will say to the idolaters : » The gods that did not make the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth and from under the heavens . «
He who made the earth by his power , and established the world by his wisdom ; also stretched out the heavens by his understanding .
He speaks , and the water in the sky produces a storm . He makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth . He makes lightning flash with the rain . He brings wind out of his storehouses .
Every man is stupid lacking knowledge . Every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols . His molten images are deceitful . There is no breath in them .
They are worthless , a work of mockery . In the time of their punishment they will perish .
Jacob’s share is not like this . For he made everything ! Israel is the tribe of his inheritance . Jehovah of Hosts is his name .
Pick up your bundle from the ground , you who dwell under siege !
Jehovah says : » I am evicting the inhabitants of the land at this time . I will cause them distress that they may be found . «
Oh , I am wounded ! My wound is serious . Then I thought that this is my punishment , and I will bear it .
My tent is destroyed . All the ropes are broken . My children have left me and have disappeared . There is no one to set up my tent again or put up my tent curtains .
The shepherds are foolish . They do not look to Jehovah for help . That is why they will not succeed and all their flocks will be scattered .
The report has arrived . Listen ! An incredible uproar is coming from the land of the north . Its army will destroy Judah's cities and make them homes for jackals .
O Jehovah , I know that humans are not able to govern their own lives . Humans cannot administer their own steps .
Correct me , O Jehovah but please be fair . Do not correct me when you are angry . Otherwise , you will reduce me to nothing .
Pour out your fury on the nations who do not know you and on people who do not worship you . They have devoured the descendants of Jacob . They have devoured them completely . They have destroyed their homes .
Jehovah said to me :
» Listen to the terms of the covenant . Tell the people of Judah and of Jerusalem :
» Jehovah the God of Israel says , ‘ Cursed is everyone who does not obey the terms of this covenant . ’
» It is the covenant I made with their ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt . Egypt was like an iron smelter furnace to them . I told them to obey me and to do everything that I commanded . I told them that if they obeyed , they would be my people and I would be their God .
» Then I would keep the promise I made to their ancestors that I would give them the rich and fertile land which they now have . ’ » ’ « I answered : « Amen Yes Jehovah . «
Jehovah said to me : » Go to the cities of Judah and to the streets of Jerusalem . Proclaim my message there and tell the people : ‘ Listen to the terms of the covenant and obey them . ’
» I solemnly warned your fathers in the day that I brought them up from the land of Egypt . Even to this day I persistently warned them , saying : ‘ Listen to my voice . ’
» Yet they did not obey or incline their ear pay attention . They walked , each one , in the stubbornness of his evil heart ! Therefore I brought on them all the words of the covenant I commanded them to do . But they did not do it . ’ «
Jehovah said to me : » A conspiracy has been found among the men of Judah and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
» They went back to the evil ways of their ancestors and refused to obey my words . They followed other gods and worshiped them . The nations of Israel and Judah have rejected the covenant that I made to their ancestors . «
» ‘ Therefore Jehovah says : ‘ I am going to bring a disaster on them that they cannot escape . Although they will cry out to me , I will not listen to them .
» ‘ Then the cities of Judah and those who live in Jerusalem will cry to the gods to whom they have been sacrificing . But these gods will never rescue them in a time of distress .
» ‘ Judah , you have as many gods as you have cities . You have set up many altars in Jerusalem to sacrifice to Baal . You have as many detestable altars as there are streets in Jerusalem . ’
» Jeremiah , do not pray for these people . Do not cry or pray for them . I will not listen when they call to me for help in times of trouble .
» What right do these people I love have to be in my house when they do so many deceitful things ? Can the meat from their sacrifices turn tragedy away from them ? They exult celebrate when they do evil .
» Jehovah called you a large olive tree that has fine-looking fruit to look at . He will set fire to you with a mighty lightning storm , and your branches will be broken .
» Jehovah of Hosts planted you . He has pronounced disaster on you . This is because of the evil things that Israel and Judah have done . They have made him infuriated by burning incense as an offering to Baal .
Jehovah revealed their plot to me so that I would understand . He showed me what they were doing .
I was like an unquestioning lamb brought to the slaughter . I did not know that they were plotting against me . They were saying : » Let us destroy the tree with its fruit . Let us cut Jeremiah off from this world of the living so that we will not be reminded of him anymore . «
O Jehovah of Hosts , you are a fair judge . You test motives and thoughts . I want to see you take revenge on them . For that reason I presented my case to you .
This is what Jehovah says : » The people of Anathoth want to kill you . They say : Do not prophesy in the name of Jehovah , or we will kill you . «
This is what Jehovah of Hosts says : » I am going to punish them . The young men will die by the sword because of war . Their sons and daughters will die by famine .
» I will bring disaster on the people of Anathoth . It will be a year of punishment . There will be no survivors . «
Jehovah , if I argued my case with you , you would prove to be right . Indeed , I must question you about matters of justice . Why are the wicked so prosperous ? Why do dishonest people succeed with impunity ?
You plant them , and they take root . They grow and bear fruit . You are near their lips , but far from their mind .
But , you know me , Jehovah . You see what I do and how in my heart I love you . Drag them away like sheep to be butchered . Guard them until it is time for them to be slaughtered .
How long will our land be dry and the grass in every field be withered ? Animals and birds are dying because of the wickedness of our people . These people say : » God does not see what we are doing . «
Jehovah says : » Jeremiah , if you get tired racing against people , how can you race against horses ? If you cannot even stand up in open country , how will you manage in the thicket by the Jordan ? «
» Even your relatives , members of your own family , have betrayed you . They join in the attacks against you . Do not trust them , even though they speak friendly words .
Jehovah says : » I have abandoned Israel . I have rejected my chosen nation . I have given the people I love into the power of their enemies .
» My chosen people have turned against me . Like a lion in the forest they have roared at me , and so I hate them .
» My chosen people are like a bird attacked from all sides by hawks . Call the wild animals to come and join in the feast !
» Many foreign rulers have destroyed my vineyard . They trampled down my fields and turned my beautiful land into a desert .
» They made it a wasteland . It lies desolate before me . The whole land has become a desert , and no one cares .
» Across the entire desert highlands people have come to plunder . Jehovah has sent war to destroy the entire land . No one can live in peace .
» My people planted wheat . They gathered weeds ! They worked hard and got nothing for it . Because of my fierce anger their crops have failed . «
Jehovah says : » I have something to say about Israel's neighbors who have ruined the land I gave to my people Israel . I will take those wicked people away from their countries like an uprooted plant , and I will rescue Judah from them .
» But after I have taken them away I will have mercy on them . I will bring each nation back to its own land and to its own country .
» If with all their hearts they will accept the religion of my people and will swear : As Jehovah lives , as they once taught my people to swear by Baal , then they will also be a part of my people and will prosper .
» However if any nation will not obey I will completely uproot it and destroy it . « I , Jehovah , have spoken .
Jehovah told me : » Go and buy a linen belt . Wear it on your hips for a while , but do not put it in any water . «
So I bought a belt and put it on my hips .
Then Jehovah said :
» Take off the linen belt . Go to the Euphrates River and hide the belt in a crack between some large rocks . «
And that is what I did , just as Jehovah commanded .
Some time later Jehovah said : » Go back and get the linen belt . «
I went back and dug the belt out of the hiding place , but the cloth had rotted , and the linen belt was ruined . It was good for nothing .
Then Jehovah said :
» Jeremiah , I will use Babylon to destroy the pride of the people of Judah and Jerusalem .
» The people of Judah are evil and stubborn . They do not listen to me . They do whatever they want and even worship other gods . When I am finished with these people , they will be good for nothing , just like this linen belt .
» This belt is tight around your waist , and that is how tightly I held onto the kingdoms of Israel and Judah . I wanted them to be my people . I wanted to make them famous , so that other nations would praise and honor me , but they refused to obey me .
» Speak this word to them : ‘ Thus says Jehovah , the God of Israel , » Every jug is to be filled with wine . When they say to you , Do we not know that every jug is to be filled with wine ?
» ‘ » Say to them : Jehovah says I am about to fill all the inhabitants of this land , the kings that sit for David on his throne , the priests , the prophets and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with drunkenness !
» ‘ » I will dash them against each other , both the fathers and the sons together , declares Jehovah . ‘ I will not show pity nor be sorry nor have compassion so as not to destroy them . « ’ «
Listen , give heed and do not be haughty arrogant . Jehovah has spoken .
Give glory to Jehovah your God before he brings darkness and before your feet stumble on the dusky mountains . You hope for light . He makes it into deep darkness and turns it into gloom .
If you will not listen , I will cry secretly over your arrogance . I will cry bitterly , and my eyes will flow with tears because Jehovah’s flock will be taken captive .
Say to the king and his mother : » Come down from your thrones , because your crowns have fallen off your heads . «
The cities in the Negev will be locked up . There will be no one to reopen them . All the people of Judah will be taken away into captivity .
» Look up , and see those who are coming from the north . Where is the flock that was given to you ? Where are your beautiful sheep ?
» What will you say when God makes the people you thought were your friends your new masters ? Will pain grip you like a woman in labor ?
» If you ask yourself : ‘ Why do these things happen to me ? ’ ’ It is because you have so many sins . Your clothes have been torn off and your limbs are bare .
» Can Ethiopians change the color of their skin or leopards change their spots ? Can you do good when you are taught to do wrong ?
» I will scatter you like straw that is blown away by a desert wind .
» This is your fate , the destiny I have planned for you , « proclaims Jehovah . » You have forgotten me and trusted in false gods .
» I will also tear off your clothes , and expose your shame .
» I have seen you commit adultery and scream with delight . I have seen you act like a brazen prostitute on the hills and in the fields . How hideous it will be for you , Jerusalem ! Will you ever be clean ? «
Jehovah spoke his word about the drought to Jeremiah :
Judah mourns and its gates collapse . The people of Judah are filled with bereavement as they sit on the ground . Their cry goes up from Jerusalem .
Important people send their assistants out for water . They do not find any water at the cisterns . They return with their containers empty . They cover their heads , because they are ashamed and dishonored .
There is no rain in the land and the ground is cracked . The farmers are disappointed . They cover their heads .
Even deer in the fields give birth and abandon their young because there is no grass .
Wild donkeys stand on the bare hills . They sniff the wind like jackals . Their eyesight fails because they have no green plants .
Do something , Jehovah , for the sake of your name , even though our iniquities testify against us . We have been unfaithful like apostates and have sinned against you .
You are Israel's hope , its savior in times of trouble . Why are you like a stranger in the land , like a traveler who stays only one night ?
Why are you like someone taken by surprise , like a mighty man who cannot help ? You , O Jehovah , are among us . We are called by your name . Do not leave us !
This is what Jehovah says about these people : » They love to wander . They do not keep their feet where they belong . Therefore Jehovah is not happy with them . He will remember their crimes and punish their sins . «
Jehovah said to me : » Do not pray for the good of these people .
» Even if they go without food , I will not listen to their cries for help . Even if they sacrifice burnt offerings and grain offerings , I will not be pleased with them . But I will destroy these people with wars , famines , and plagues . «
I said : » Alas , O Lord Jehovah , prophets are telling them : ‘ You will not see wars or famines , for I will give you lasting peace in this place . «
Jehovah then told me : » These are the lies that the prophets are telling in my name : They claim that I sent them . They claim that I commanded them . They claim that I spoke to them . They even dreamed up visions to tell you . Their predictions are worthless ! They are the products of their own imagination .
» I did not send these prophets . Yet , they prophesy in my name that there will be no wars or famines in this land . So this is what I , Jehovah , say about them : ‘ Wars and famines will bring an end to these prophets .
» ‘ The people to whom they prophesy will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem . They will be victims of famines and wars . No one will bury them , their wives , their sons , or their daughters . I will pour on them the destruction that they deserve . ’
» Say this to them : ‘ My eyes flow with tears day and night without stopping because my dear people will suffer massive destruction . It will be a very serious blow .
» ‘ If I go to the field , I see those killed because of war . If I go to the city , I see those sick because of famine . Prophets and priests wander through a land they have not heard of . ’ «
Have you completely rejected Judah ? Do you despise Zion ? Why have you struck us so hard that we cannot heal ? We hope for peace , but no good comes from it . We hope for a time of healing , but there's only terror .
O Jehovah , we recognize our wickedness and the wrongs done by our ancestors . We have sinned against you .
For the sake of your name , do not despise us . Do not dishonor your glorious throne . Remember your promise to us . Do not break it .
The valueless gods of the nations cannot make it rain . The skies cannot give showers by themselves . But you can , O Jehovah our God . We hope in you because you do all these things .
Jehovah said to me : » I would not feel sorry for these people , even if Moses and Samuel were standing in front of me . Send them away from my presence , and let them go .
» When they ask you where they should go , say to them : This is what Jehovah says : Those who are to die will die . Those who are to die in wars will die in wars . Those who are to die in famines will die in famines . Those who are to die in captivity will die in captivity .
» I will appoint over them four kinds of punishment , declares Jehovah . I will send swords to kill , dogs to drag away , and birds of the air and animals of the earth to devour and destroy .
» I will make these people a horrifying shocking sight to all the kingdoms on the earth . This will happen because of what Judah's King Manasseh , son of Hezekiah , did in Jerusalem .
» Who will take pity on you , Jerusalem ? No one will mourn for you . No one will bother to ask how you are doing .
» You left me , declares Jehovah . You turned your back on me . So I will stretch out my hand against you use my power against you and destroy you . I am tired of showing compassion to you .
» I will separate them with a winnowing shovel at the city gates . I will make them childless . I will destroy my people because they will not change their ways .
» Their widows will be more numerous than the grains of sand on the seashore . At noontime I will send a destroyer against the mothers of young men . I will suddenly bring anguish and terror to them .
» A mother who gives birth to seven sons will grow faint and breathe her last . She will die , ashamed and humiliated , while it is still daylight . I will put survivors from these people to death in the presence of their enemies , says Jehovah .
Sadness is mine ! Why did my mother bring me into the world ? I have to quarrel and argue with everyone in the whole earth . I have not lent any money or borrowed any ; yet everyone curses me .
Jehovah said : » I will certainly rescue you for a good . I will certainly make your enemies plead with you in times of evil and in times of distress .
» Can a man break iron , especially the iron from the north that is mixed with copper ?
» Jehovah said to me : ‘ I will send enemies to carry away the wealth and treasures of my people . This will punish them for the sins they have committed throughout the land .
» I will make them serve their enemies in a land they know nothing about . My anger is like fire , and it will burn forever . «
Then I said : » O Jehovah you understand . Remember me and help me . Let me have revenge on those who persecute me . Do not be so patient with them that they succeed in killing me . Remember that it is for your sake that I have suffered reproach .
» You spoke to me , and I listened to every word . I belong to you , Lord Jehovah . Your words filled my heart with joy and happiness .
» I did not spend my time with other people laughing and having a good time . In obedience to your orders I stayed by myself and was filled with anger .
» Why do I suffer constant pain ? Why is my wound incurable , refusing to be healed ? Will you indeed be to me like a deceptive stream with water that is unreliable ? «
Therefore Jehovah says : » If you return I will restore you . You will stand before me . If you extract the precious from the worthless , you will become my spokesman . They for their part may turn to you . But you must not turn to them . «
» I will make you a fortified wall of copper to these people . Though they fight against you , they will not prevail over you . For I am with you to save you and deliver you , declares Jehovah .
» I will deliver you from the hand of the wicked . I will redeem you from the grasp of the cruel . «
The word of Jehovah also came to me :
» You shall not take a wife for yourself nor have sons or daughters in this place .
Jehovah says this about the sons and daughters born in this place , and about their mothers who bear them , and their fathers who begot them in this land :
» They will die of lethal diseases . They will not be mourned or buried . They will be as dung on the surface of the ground and die by sword and famine war and starvation . Their carcasses will become food for the birds of the sky and for the animals of the earth . «
Jehovah says : » Do not enter a house of mourning , or go to lament or to console them . I have withdrawn my peace from this people , « declares Jehovah , » even my loving kindness and compassion . «
» Both great and small men will die in this land . They will not be buried , they will not be lamented , nor will anyone gash himself or shave his head for them .
» Men will not break bread in mourning for them in order to comfort anyone for the dead . Nor will they give them a cup of consolation to drink for anyone's father or mother .
» Moreover you shall not go into a house of feasting to sit with them to eat and drink . «
» This is what Jehovah of Hosts , the God of Israel , says : ‘ I am going to put a stop to the sounds of joy and happiness and the sounds of brides and grooms in this place . This will happen in your lifetime , even as you watch . ’ «
» When you tell the people all these things , they will ask you : ‘ Why does Jehovah threaten us with all these disasters ? What have we done wrong ? How have we sinned against Jehovah our God ? ’ «
» Tell them : ‘ It is because your ancestors abandoned me , ’ ’ says Jehovah . They followed other gods , served them , worshiped them , and abandoned me . They did not obey my law .
» You have done worse than your ancestors . All of you are following your own stubborn , evil ways that keep you from listening obeying to me .
» Therefore I will throw you out of this land into a land that you and your ancestors have not heard of . There you will serve other gods day and night because I will no longer have pity on you . « ’
» That is why the days are coming , « declares Jehovah , » when people will no longer begin an oath with : ‘ Jehovah brought the people of Israel out of Egypt ’ ’ and ‘ as Jehovah lives . ’
» But they will say : Jehovah brought the people of Israel out of the land of the north and all the lands where he had scattered them . They will say this because I will bring them back to the land that I gave their fathers .
» I am going to send for many fishermen , « says Jehovah , » and they will catch the people of Israel . After that , I will send for many hunters , and they will hunt for them on every mountain and hill and even in the cracks in the rocks .
» I see everything that they do . They cannot hide anything from me . Their wickedness cannot be hidden ; I can see it .
» First , I will have them pay twice as much for their wickedness and their sin , because they have polluted my land . They have filled my property with the lifeless statues of their detestable and disgusting idols .
Jehovah is my strength and my fortress , my refuge in times of trouble . Nations come to you from the most distant parts of the world and say : Our ancestors have inherited lies , worthless and unprofitable gods .
Can people make gods for themselves ? They are not really gods !
» That is what I will teach them . This time I will make my power and my strength known to them . THEN THEY WILL KNOW THAT MY NAME IS JEHOVAH . «
Jehovah says : Judah's sin is written with an iron pen . It is engraved with a diamond point on the tablet of their hearts and on the horns strength authority of their altars .
Even their children remember their altars and their poles images dedicated to the goddess Asherah beside large trees on high hills
and on mountains in the open country . I will turn your wealth and all your treasures into loot . I will do this because of your worship sites and your sin throughout all your territory .
You will lose the inheritance that I gave you . I will make you serve your enemies in a land that you have not heard of . I will do this because you have stirred up the fire of my anger . It will burn for a very long time .
This is what Jehovah says : » Cursed is the person who trusts humans , who makes flesh and blood his strength and whose heart turns away from Jehovah .
» He will be like a bush in the desert and will not see when prosperity comes . He will live in stony wastes in the wilderness , a land of salt without inhabitant .
» Blessed is the man who trusts in Jehovah , whose refuge and security confidence and hope is Jehovah .
» For he will be like a tree planted by the water . It extends its roots by a stream and will not fear when the heat comes . Its leaves will be green . It will not be anxious in a year of drought nor cease to yield fruit .
» The heart is more deceitful than all else and is desperately corrupt . Who can understand it ?
» I , Jehovah , search the heart and examine the mind inner man . I give to each man according to his ways , according to the results of his deeds .
» A person who gets rich dishonestly is like a partridge that hatches eggs it did not lay . During his lifetime , he will lose his wealth . In the end , he will be a wicked fool . «
From the very beginning our sanctuary was a glorious throne on high .
You will put to shame all that forsake you , O Jehovah , the hope of Israel . Those who turn away on earth will be written down , for they have forsaken Jehovah , the fountain of living water .
Heal me , O Jehovah , and I will be healed ! Save me and I will be saved ! For you are my song of praise .
Look , they keep saying to me : Where is the word of Jehovah ? Let it come now !
I have not hurried away from being your shepherd . I have not longed for the day of destruction . You know what I used to say .
Do not cause me fear and anxiety . For you are my refuge in the day of disaster .
Let those who persecute me be put to shame . Do not let me be put to shame . Let them be dismayed , but let me not be dismayed . Bring on them a day of disaster . Crush them with twofold destruction !
Jehovah said to me : » Go and stand in the public gate , through which the kings of Judah come in and go out , as well as in all the gates of Jerusalem .
Say to them : » Listen to the word of Jehovah , kings of Judah , and all Judah and all inhabitants of Jerusalem who come in through these gates :
» Jehovah says : ‘ Take heed for yourselves , and do not carry any load on the Sabbath day or bring anything in through the gates of Jerusalem .
» You shall not bring a load out of your houses on the Sabbath day nor do any work . You should keep the Sabbath day holy , as I commanded your forefathers .
» Yet they did not listen or incline their ears . They stiffened their necks in order not to listen or take correction .
» But it will come about , if you listen attentively to me , declares Jehovah , to bring no load in through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day , but to keep the Sabbath day holy by doing no work on it ,
then there will come in through the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on the throne of David . They will ride in chariots and on horses , they and their princes , the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem . This city will be inhabited for a very long time .
» They will come in from the cities of Judah and from the environs of Jerusalem , from the land of Benjamin , from the lowland , from the hill country and from the Negev . They will bring burnt offerings , sacrifices , grain offerings and incense . They will also bring sacrifices of thanksgiving to the house of Jehovah .
» If you do not listen to me to keep the Sabbath day holy by not carrying a load and coming in through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day , then I will kindle a fire in its gates and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem . And it will not be quenched . « ’ «
Jehovah spoke his word to Jeremiah :
» Go to the potter's house . There I will give you my message . «
I went to the potter's house , and he was working there at his wheel .
When a clay pot he was working on was ruined , he would rework it into a new clay pot the way he wanted to make it .
Jehovah spoke his word to me . Jehovah asked :
» Nation of Israel , can I do with you as this potter does with clay ? « Nation of Israel , » You are in my hands like the clay in the potter's hands .
» At one time I may threaten to tear up , break down , and destroy a nation or a kingdom .
» However if the nation that I threatened turns away from doing wrong . Then I will change my plans about the disaster I planned to do to it .
» At another time I may promise to build and plant a nation or a kingdom .
» If that nation does what I consider evil and does not obey me I will change my mind about the good that I promised to do to it .
» Now say to the people of Judah and to those who live in Jerusalem , This is what Jehovah says : ‘ I am going to prepare a disaster and make a plot against you . Turn from your evil ways , change your lives , and do good . ’
» But they will answer , It is useless ! We will live the way we want to . We will go our own stubborn , evil ways .
» This is what Jehovah says : ‘ Ask among the nations if anyone has ever heard anything like this . The people of Israel have done a very horrible thing .
» ‘ Does the snow of Lebanon forsake the rock of the open country ? Or is the cold flowing water from a foreign land ever snatched away ?
» ‘ My people have forgotten me . They burn incense to worthless gods and they have stumbled from their ways . They stray from the ancient paths to walk in pathways and not on a highway .
» ‘ They make their land desolation . It becomes an object of perpetual hissing . Everyone who passes by it will be astonished and shake his head .
» ‘ Like an east wind I will scatter them before the enemy . I will show them my back and not my face in the day of their calamity . ’ «
Then they said : » Come and let us devise plans against Jeremiah . Surely the law is not going to be lost to the priest , nor counsel to the wise man , nor the divine word to the prophet ! Come on and let us strike him with our tongue , and let us pay no attention to any of his words . «
Do pay close attention to me , O Jehovah ! Listen to what my opponents are saying !
Should good be repaid with evil ? For they have dug a pit for me . Remember how I stood before you to speak good on their behalf . I tried to turn away your wrath from them .
Therefore , give their children over to famine and deliver them up to the power of the sword . Let their wives become childless and widowed . Let their men also be smitten to death and their young men struck down by the sword in battle .
Let an outcry be heard from their houses when you suddenly bring raiders upon them . For they have dug a pit to capture me and hidden snares for my feet .
Yet You , O Jehovah , know all their deadly designs against me . Do not forgive their iniquity or blot out their sin from your sight . But may they be overthrown before you . Deal with them in the time of your anger !
Jehovah says : Go and buy a potter's earthenware jar , and take some of the elders of the people and some of the senior priests .
Then go out to the valley of Ben-hinnom Hinnom Valley , which is by the entrance of the potsherd gate , and proclaim there the words that I tell you .
Say : » Hear the word of Jehovah , O kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem : thus says Jehovah of Hosts , the God of Israel , » ‘ » Behold I am about to bring adversity upon this place . The ears of everyone who hears of it will quiver with fear .
» ‘ » This is because they have forsaken me . They have made this an alien place and have burned sacrifices in it to other gods . These are gods that neither they nor their forefathers nor the kings of Judah had ever known . They have filled this place with the blood of the blameless innocent . « ’ «
» ‘ They have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal . This is not something I commanded or spoke of , nor did it ever enter my mind heart conscience . « ’
» ‘ » Therefore days are coming , declares Jehovah , when this place will no longer be called Topheth or the valley of Ben-hinnom , but rather the valley of Slaughter .
» I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place . I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hand of those who seek their life . I will give their carcasses as food for the birds of the sky and the animals of the earth .
» I will also make this city a desolation and an object of hissing . Everyone who passes by it will be astonished and hiss because of all its disasters .
» I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters , and they will eat one another's flesh in the siege and in the distress with which their enemies and those who seek their life will cause them . « ’
» Then you are to break the jar in the sight of the men who accompany you .
» ‘ Say to them : ‘ Jehovah of Hosts says : » Like this I will break this people and this city . It is just like one breaks a potter's vessel that cannot again be repaired . They will bury in Topheth because there is no other place for burial . « ’
» ‘ This is how I will treat this place and its inhabitants , ’ declares Jehovah , ‘ I will make this city like Topheth .
» ‘ The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will be defiled like Topheth . They burned sacrifices to the heavenly hosts and poured out drink offerings to other gods on the rooftops of all of their houses . ’ «
Then Jeremiah came from Topheth , where Jehovah had sent him to prophesy . He stood in the court of Jehovah’s house and said to all the people :
» Jehovah of Hosts , the God of Israel says : ‘ I am about to bring on this city and all its towns the entire disaster that I have declared against it . This is because they have stiffened their necks vigorously resisted so as not to heed my words . ’ «
Pashhur the priest , son of Immer , who was chief officer in the house of Jehovah , heard Jeremiah prophesying these things .
Pashhur had Jeremiah the prophet beaten and put him in the stocks that were at the upper Benjamin Gate , which was by the house of Jehovah .
The next day Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks . Jeremiah said to him : » Pashhur is not the name Jehovah has called you . He has called you Magor-missabib .
» For Jehovah says : ‘ Behold , I am going to make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends . They will fall by the sword of their enemies while you watch . I will hand over all Judah to the hand control of the king of Babylon . He will carry them away as exiles to Babylon and will slay them with the sword .
» ‘ I will also hand over all the wealth of this city , all its produce and all its costly things . I will even give all the treasures of the kings of Judah to the hand of their enemies . They will plunder them and take them away to Babylon .
» ‘ You , Pashhur , and all who live in your house will go into captivity . You will enter Babylon , and there you will die and be buried , you and all your friends to whom you have falsely prophesied . ’ «
O Jehovah , You have deceived me . I was deceived ! You have overcome me and prevailed . I have become a laughingstock all day long ; everyone mocks me .
Each time I speak , I cry aloud . I proclaim violence and destruction ! For me the word of Jehovah has resulted in reproach and derision all day long .
But if I say : » I will not remember him or speak anymore in his name , « then in my heart it becomes like a burning fire shut up in my bones . I am weary of holding it in . I cannot endure it .
For I have heard the whispering of many : » Terror on every side ! Denounce him ; yes , let us denounce him ! « All my trusted friends are watching for my fall . They say : » Perhaps he will be deceived , so that we may prevail against him and take our revenge on him . «
Jehovah is with me like a powerful champion . Therefore my persecutors will stumble and not prevail . They will be utterly ashamed ! They have failed with an everlasting disgrace that will not be forgotten .
Yet , O Jehovah of Hosts you test the righteous . You see the mind and the heart . Let me see your vengeance on them for to you I have revealed my cause .
Sing to Jehovah , praise Jehovah ! He has delivered the needy one from the hand domination of evildoers .
Cursed is the day when I was born . Let the day not be blessed when my mother bore me !
Cursed is the man who brought the news to my father , saying : » A baby boy has been born to you ! « He made him very happy .
But let that man be like the cities Jehovah overthrew without relenting . Let him hear an outcry in the morning and a shout of alarm at noon .
He did not kill me before birth , so that my mother would have been my grave , and her womb ever pregnant .
Why did I ever come forth from the womb to look on trouble and sorrow ? My days have been spent in shame !
This is the word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah . King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur the son of Malchijah , and Zephaniah the priest , the son of Maaseiah . The king said to Jeremiah :
» Please inquire of Jehovah on our behalf . Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is warring against us . Perhaps Jehovah will deal with us with all his wonderful acts , so that the enemy will withdraw from us . «
Jeremiah responded to them : » Say the following Zedekiah :
‘ Jehovah the God of Israel says : » Behold , I am about to turn back the weapons of war you control . The weapons you use to make war against the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who besiege you outside the wall . I will gather them into the center of this city .
‘ » I will war against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm with my great power . I will extend my anger , wrath and great indignation .
‘ » I will also strike down the inhabitants of this city , both man and beast . They will die of a great pestilence . « ’
» ‘ » Afterwards , « declares Jehovah : » I will hand over Judah's King Zedekiah , his officials , the people , and everyone else in this city who survives the plague , war , and famine . They will be handed over to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and to their enemies who want to kill them . Nebuchadnezzar will kill them with swords . He will not spare them , show them compassion , or care for them . « ’
» Also say to this people , ‘ Jehovah says : » Behold , I set before you the way of life and the way of death .
» ‘ He who dwells in this city will die by the sword and by famine and by pestilence . He who goes out and surrenders to the Chaldeans who are besieging you will live . He will have his own life as booty . « ’
» ‘ » For I have set my face against this city for harm and not for good , declares Jehovah . It will be surrendered to the king of Babylon and he will burn it with fire . «
» ‘ Then say to the household of the king of Judah : ‘ Hear the word of Jehovah ,
» ‘ O house of David , Jehovah says : » Administer justice every morning . Deliver the person who has been robbed from the power of his oppressor . That way I may not have to offer my wrath like fire and burn with none to extinguish it , because of the evil of your deeds . « ’
» ‘ I am against you , O valley dweller , O rocky plain , ’ ’ declares Jehovah . ‘ You men say : » Who will come down against us ? Or who will enter into our habitations ?
» ‘ But I will punish you according to the results of your deeds , ’ ’ declares Jehovah . ‘ I will kindle a fire in its forest that will devour all its environs . ’ «
This is what Jehovah says : » Go to the palace of the king of Judah , and speak this message there :
» ‘ Listen to the word of Jehovah , you officials , you people who come into these gates , and you , king of Judah , the one sitting on David's throne .
This is what Jehovah says : » Judge fairly , and do what is right . Rescue those who have been robbed from those who oppress them . Do not mistreat foreigners , orphans , or widows , and do not oppress them . Do not kill innocent people in this place .
» ‘ If you do what I say , then the kings who sit on David's throne will ride through the gates of this palace in chariots and on horses along with their officials and their people . « ’
» ‘ But if you do not do what I say , I will take an oath on myself , ’ ’ declares Jehovah , ‘ this palace will become a pile of rubble . ’
» Jehovah says concerning the house of the king of Judah : ‘ You are like Gilead to me , like the summit of Lebanon . Most assuredly I will make you like a wilderness , like cities that are not inhabited .
» I will set apart destroyers against you , each with his weapons . They will cut down your choicest cedars and throw them on the fire .
» Many nations will pass by this city . They will say to one another : Why has Jehovah done thus to this great city ?
» They will answer : ‘ Because they abandoned the covenant of Jehovah their God and bowed down to other gods and served them . « ’
» Do not weep for the dead or mourn for him . Weep continually for the one who goes away . For he will never return or see his native land .
» ‘ This is what Jehovah says about King Josiah's son Shallum , who succeeded his father as king of Judah and left this place : ‘ He will never come back here again .
» ‘ He will die in the place where they led him captive . He will not see this land again . ’
» Woe to him who builds his house without righteousness and his upper rooms without justice . Woe to him who uses his neighbor's services without pay and does not give him his wages .
» ‘ Woe to him who says : ‘ I will build myself a roomy house with spacious upper rooms , and cut out its windows . I will panel it with cedar and paint it bright red vermilion . ’
Do you become a king because you are competing in cedar ? Did not your father eat and drink and do justice and righteousness ? Then it was well with him .
He pled the cause of the afflicted and needy . Then it was well . » Is that not what it means to know me ? « Says Jehovah .
» Your eyes and your heart are intent only upon your own dishonest gain . You are shedding innocent blood and on practicing oppression and extortion . «
Therefore Jehovah tells us about Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah : » They will not cry for him : ‘ Alas , my brother ! ’ ’ And , ‘ Alas , sister ! ’ ’ They will not mourn him : ‘ Alas for the master ! ’ ’ And , » Alas for his splendor ! «
He will be buried with a donkey's burial . He will be dragged off and thrown out beyond the gates of Jerusalem .
» Go up to Lebanon and cry out ! Lift up your voice in Bashan . Cry out also from Abarim , for all your lovers have been crushed .
I spoke to you in your prosperity . But you said : ‘ I will not listen ! ’ ’ This has been your practice from your youth , that you have not obeyed my voice .
» The wind will sweep away all your shepherds . Your lovers will go into captivity . Then you will surely be ashamed and humiliated because of all your wickedness .
» You who dwell in Lebanon nested in the cedars . How you will groan when pangs come upon you , Pain like a woman in childbirth ! «
» ‘ As I live , ’ ’ says Jehovah , ‘ even though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were a signet ring on my right hand , yet I would pull you off .
» As I live , « says Jehovah , » I will hand you over to those who want to kill you , those you fear , King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and the Babylonians .
» I will throw you and your mother into another land . You were not born there , but you will die there .
» You will want to return to this land , but you will not be allowed to come home .
» This Jehoiakin is like a rejected and broken pot that no one wants . Is that why he and his descendants will be thrown out and cast into another land they have never heard of ?
» O land , land , land ! Hear the word of Jehovah .
» This is what Jehovah says : ‘ Write this about Jehoiakin : » He will be childless . He will not prosper in his lifetime . None of his descendants will succeed him as king . They will not sit on David's throne and rule Judah again . « ’ «
» Woe to the shepherds who are destroying and scattering the sheep of my pasture ! « Says Jehovah .
This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says concerning the shepherds who are tending my people : » You have scattered my flock and driven them away . You have not attended to them . I am about to attend to you for the evil of your deeds , « says Jehovah .
» Then I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them and bring them back to their pasture . Then they will be fruitful and multiply .
» I will also raise up shepherds over them who will tend them . They will not be afraid any longer , nor be terrified , nor will any be missing , proclaims Jehovah .
» The days are coming , « declares Jehovah , » when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch . He will reign as king and act wisely and do justice and righteousness in the land .
» In His days Judah will be saved . Israel will dwell securely . This is his name by which he will be called , Jehovah Is Our Righteousness .
» Therefore the days are coming , « declares Jehovah , » when they will no longer say , ‘ As Jehovah lives , the one who brought up the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt . ’
» ‘ Instead , ‘ Jehovah lives , the one who brought up and led back the descendants of the household of Israel from the northland and from all the countries where I had driven them . ’ ’ Then they will live on their own soil . ’ «
My heart is broken within me . All my bones tremble ! I have become like a drunken man , even like a man overcome with wine . This is because of Jehovah and because of his holy words .
The land is full of adulterers ! The land mourns because of the curse . The pastures of the wilderness have dried up . Their course also is evil and their might is not right .
» The prophets and priests are godless . Even in my Temple I have found them doing evil , « declares Jehovah .
» That is why their own way will become like a slippery path in the dark . They will be chased away , and they will fall down in the dark . I will bring disaster on them . It is time for them to be punished , « proclaims Jehovah .
» Say this about the prophets of Samaria : ‘ I saw something disgusting . The prophets of Samaria prophesied by Baal and led my people Israel astray . ’
» Say this about the prophets of Jerusalem : ‘ I see something horrible . The prophets of Jerusalem commit adultery and live a lie . They support those who do evil so that no one turns back from his wickedness . They are all like Sodom to me , and those who live in Jerusalem are like Gomorrah . ’ «
This is what Jehovah of Hosts says about the prophets : » I will give them wormwood to eat and poison to drink . The prophets of Jerusalem have spread godlessness throughout the land . «
This is what Jehovah of Hosts says : » Do not listen to what the prophets are saying to you . They fill you with false hope . They speak about visions that they dreamed up . These visions are not from Jehovah .
» They keep saying to those who despise me , Jehovah says : ‘ Everything will go well for you . ’ ’ They tell all who live by their own stubborn ways : ‘ Nothing bad will happen to you . ’ «
Who is in Jehovah’s inner circle and sees and hears his word ? Who pays attention and listens to his word ?
The storm of Jehovah vents his wrath . A whirling tempest will swirl down on the head of the wicked .
The anger of Jehovah will not turn back until he has performed and carried out the purposes intent of his heart . In the last days you will clearly understand it .
» I did not send these prophets , but they ran . I did not speak to them , but they prophesied .
» If they had stood in my council they would have announced my words to my people . They would have turned them back from their evil way and from the evil of their deeds . «
» I am a God who is near , « declares Jehovah . » I am not a God far off ! «
» Can a man hide himself in hiding places so I do not see him ? « asks Jehovah . » Do I not fill the heavens and the earth ? « Declares Jehovah .
» I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy falsely in my name . They say : ‘ I had a dream ! I had a dream ! «
» How long ? Is there anything in the hearts of the prophets , who prophesy falsehood , even these prophets of the deception of their own heart ?
» They think the dreams they tell will make my people forget my name , just as their ancestors forgot my name and turned to Baal worship .
» The prophet who has had a dream should say it is only a dream . The prophet who has heard my message should proclaim that message faithfully . « » What good is chaff compared with wheat ? « Says Jehovah .
» My message is like a fire and like a hammer that breaks rocks in pieces .
» I am against those prophets who take each other's words and proclaim them as my message . «
» I am also against those prophets , « says Jehovah , » They speak their own words and claim they came from me ! «
» Listen to what I , Jehovah , say ! I am against the prophets who tell their dreams that are full of lies . They tell these dreams and lead my people astray with their lies and their boasting . I did not send them or order them to go . They are of no help at all to the people . I Jehovah have spoken ! «
Jehovah said to me : » Jeremiah , when one of my people or a prophet or a priest asks you , what is Jehovah’s message ? You are to say : ‘ You are a burden to Jehovah , and he is going to get rid of you . ’
» If any of my people or a prophet or a priest even uses the words : ‘ Jehovah’s infallable utterance , ’ ’ I will punish them and their families .
» Each one of you should ask your friends and your relatives : What answer has Jehovah given ? What has Jehovah said ?
» So you must no longer use the words : ‘ Jehovah’s infallable utterance , ’ ’ because if any of you do , I will make my message a real utterance to you . The people have perverted the words of their God , the living God , the Lord Jehovah .
» ‘ Jeremiah , ask the prophets : ‘ What answer did Jehovah give you ? What did Jehovah say ? ’ «
» ‘ If you disobey my command and use the words : ‘ Jehovah’s utterance , ’ ’ then hear this .
» ‘ » I will certainly pick you up and throw you far away from me , both you and the city that I gave to you and your ancestors .
» ‘ » I will bring on you everlasting shame and disgrace that will never be forgotten . « ’ «
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon carried away captive Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim , king of Judah , and the officials of Judah . He also captured the craftsmen and smiths from Jerusalem and brought them to Babylon . Then Jehovah showed me two baskets of figs set before the Temple of Jehovah !
One basket had very good figs , like first-ripe figs , and the other basket had very bad figs that could not be eaten because they were rotten .
Then Jehovah said to me : » What do you see , Jeremiah ? « I said : » Figs . The good figs are very good . The bad figs are very bad . They cannot be eaten because they are rotten . «
The word of Jehovah came to me , He said :
» Jehovah the God of Israel says : ‘ Like these good figs , so I will regard the captives of Judah as good . I have sent them out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans .
» ‘ I will watch over them for their good , and I will bring them to this land again . I will build them up and not overthrow them . I will plant them and not uproot them .
» ‘ I will give them a heart will desire to know me . I am Jehovah ! They will be my people , and I will be their God ! They will return to me with their whole heart .
» ‘ Like the bad figs that cannot be eaten because they are rotten , « says Jehovah , » so I will abandon Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials , and the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land and the ones who dwell in the land of Egypt .
» ‘ » I will make them a horrifying sight to all the kingdoms of the earth . They will be a disgrace and an example . They will become something ridiculed and cursed wherever I scatter them .
» ‘ » I will send wars , famines , and plagues until they disappear from the land that I gave to them and their ancestors . « ’ «
Jehovah spoke his word to Jeremiah about all the people of Judah when Jehoiakim , son of Josiah , was in his fourth year as king . This was the first year that Nebuchadnezzar was king of Babylon .
The prophet Jeremiah spoke to all the people of Judah and to everyone who lived in Jerusalem . He said :
» Jehovah continued to speak his word to me for twenty-three years . This covered the time from when Josiah , son of Amon , was in his thirteenth year as king of Judah until today . I have spoken to you again and again , but you have not listened .
» Jehovah has sent all his servants the prophets to you . Yet , you have not listened or paid attention to them . «
The prophets said : » Turn from your evil ways and the evil you have done , and live in the land that Jehovah permanently gave to you and your ancestors .
» Do not follow other gods to serve and worship them . Do not make me furious about the idols your hands have shaped . Then I will not harm you . «
» ‘ You have not listened to me , ’ ’ declares Jehovah . ‘ You have made me furious about the idols your hands have shaped . You have brought harm upon yourselves . ’
» This is what Jehovah of Hosts says : ‘ » You did not listen to my words ,
so I am going to send for all the families from the north . I will also send for my servant King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon , « says Jehovah . » I will bring the families from the north to attack this land , its people , and all these surrounding nations . I am going to destroy them and turn them into something terrible , something ridiculed , and something permanently ruined .
» I will take from them the sounds of joy and happiness , the sounds of brides and grooms , the sound of mills , and the light of lamps .
» This whole land will be ruined and become a wasteland . These nations will serve the king of Babylon for seventy years . « ’
» ‘ When the seventy years are over , I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation for their crimes , ’ ’ declares Jehovah . ‘ I will turn Babylon into a permanent wasteland .
» ‘ I will bring on that land all the disasters I threatened to do to it , everything that Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations , everything written in this book .
» ‘ Many nations and great kings will make slaves of the people of Babylon . I will pay them back for what they have done . ’ «
» This is what Jehovah the God of Israel said to me : ‘ Take from my hand this cup filled with the wine of my fury , and make all the nations to whom I am sending you drink from it .
» ‘ When they drink from it , they will stagger and go insane because of the wars that I am going to send them . ’ «
So I took the cup from Jehovah’s hand . I made all the nations to whom Jehovah sent me drink from it .
Jerusalem and the cities of Judah as well as its kings and officials drank from it . When they drank from it , they became wastelands and ruins , something ridiculed and cursed , until today .
I also made these people drink from it : Pharaoh king of Egypt , his servants , officials , all his people ,
and all the foreign people living among them ; all the kings of the land of Uz ; all the kings of Philistia , those from the cities of Ashkelon , Gaza , and Ekron , and the people left in Ashdod ;
Edom , Moab , and the people of Ammon ;
all the kings of Tyre and Sidon , and the kings on the seacoast ;
Dedan , Tema , Buz , and all who shave the hair on their foreheads ;
all the kings of Arabia , and all the kings of the foreign people living in the desert ;
all the kings of Zimri , all the kings of Elam , and all the kings of Media ;
all the kings of the north , near and far , one after another-all the kingdoms of the earth . Last of all , the king of Sheshach will drink from the cup .
» Jehovah said : ‘ Say to them , This is what Jehovah of Hosts , » the God of Israel , says : ‘ Drink , get drunk , vomit , fall down , and do not get up because of the wars that I am going to send you . « ’
» ‘ If they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink from it , say to them : ‘ This is what Jehovah of Hosts says : » You must drink from it !
» ‘ I am going to bring disaster on the city that is named after me . Do you think you will go unpunished ? You will not go unpunished ! I am declaring war on all those who live on earth , ’ ’ declares Jehovah of Hosts .
» That is why you will prophecy all these things to them and say : Jehovah roars from above . He thunders from his holy dwelling place . He roars against his land . He shouts like those who stomp grapes . He shouts against all those who live on earth .
» ‘ The sound is echoing to the ends of the earth because Jehovah has brought charges against the nations . He will judge all humans . He will kill the wicked , ’ ’ declares Jehovah .
» This is what Jehovah of Hosts says : ‘ Disaster is spreading from nation to nation . A great storm is brewing from the distant corners of the earth .
» ‘ On that day those killed by Jehovah will stretch from one end of the earth to the other . They will not be mourned , taken away , or buried . They will become like manure on the ground . ’
» Mourn , you shepherds , and cry . Roll in the dust , you leaders of the flock . The time has come for you to be slaughtered . The time has come for you to be scattered , and you will break like fine pottery .
» There will be no place for the shepherds to flee , no escape for the leaders of the flock .
» The shepherds are crying and the leaders of the flock are mourning because Jehovah is stripping their pasture .
» The peaceful pastures are destroyed by Jehovah’s burning anger .
» He has left his lair like a lion . Their land has been ruined because of the heat of the oppressor , because of the fury of his anger . «
Shortly after Jehoiakim son of Josiah became king of Judah ,
Jehovah said to me : » Stand in the court of the Temple and proclaim all I have commanded you to say to the people who come from the towns of Judah to worship there . Do not omit anything .
» Perhaps the people will listen and give up their evil ways . If they do I will change my mind about the destruction I plan to bring on them for all their wicked deeds .
» ‘ Jehovah told me to say to the people : ‘ I Jehovah said that you must obey me by following the teaching that I gave you .
» ‘ » You are to pay attention to the words of my servants , the prophets , whom I kept sending to you . You have never obeyed what they said .
If you continue to disobey I will do to this Temple what I did to Shiloh , and all the nations of the world will use the name of this city as a curse . ’ « ’ «
The priests , the prophets , and all the people heard me saying these things in the Temple .
As soon as I had finished saying all that Jehovah commanded me to say , they grabbed me and shouted : » You ought to be killed for this !
» Why have you said in Jehovah’s name that this Temple will become like Shiloh and that this city will be destroyed and no one will live in it ? ’ « Then the people crowded around me .
When the leaders of Judah heard what had happened , they hurried from the royal palace to the Temple and took their places at the New Gate .
The priests and the prophets said to the leaders and to the people : » This man deserves to be sentenced to death because he has spoken against our city . You heard him with your own ears . «
Then I Jeremiah said : » Jehovah sent me to proclaim everything that you heard me say against this Temple and against this city .
» You must change the way you are living and the things you are doing . You must obey Jehovah your God . If you do , he will change his mind about the destruction that he said he would bring on you .
» I am in your hand power ! Do with me whatever you think is fair and right .
» But if you put me to death , you and everyone else in Jerusalem will be guilty of murdering an innocent man . This is because everything I spoke came from Jehovah . «
The judges and the other people told the priests and prophets : » Since Jeremiah only told us what Jehovah our God had said , we do not think he deserves to die . «
Then some of the leaders from other towns stepped forward . They told the crowd :
» Years ago when Hezekiah was king of Judah , a prophet named Micah from the town of Moresheth said : ‘ Jehovah of Hosts says , » Jerusalem will be plowed under and left in ruins . Thorns will cover the mountain where the Temple now stands . « ’
Then the leaders continued : » No one put Micah to death for saying that . Instead , King Hezekiah prayed to Jehovah with reverence and trembling and asked him to have mercy . Then Jehovah decided not to destroy Jerusalem , even though he had already said he would . People of Judah , if Jeremiah is killed we will bring a terrible disaster on ourselves .
» There was another man prophesying in the name of Jehovah . His name was Uriah , son of Shemaiah , from Kiriath Jearim . He prophesied against this city and this land as Jeremiah did .
» When King Jehoiakim and all his personal troops and officials heard what Uriah said the king wanted to put him to death . But Uriah heard about it and fled in fear to Egypt .
» King Jehoiakim sent soldiers to Egypt : Elnathan son of Achbor and other soldiers along with him .
» They brought Uriah from Egypt and took him to King Jehoiakim . The king executed Uriah and threw his body into the burial ground for the common people . «
Ahikam , son of Shaphan , supported Jeremiah . So Jeremiah was not handed over to the people to be put to death .
Jehovah spoke his word to Jeremiah when Zedekiah , son of King Josiah of Judah , began to rule .
This is what Jehovah said to me : » Make leather straps and a wooden yoke , and strap the yoke on your neck .
» Then send messages to the kings of Edom , Moab , Ammon , Tyre , and Sidon , with messengers who have come to King Zedekiah of Judah in Jerusalem .
» Give them an order for their masters : This is what Jehovah of Hosts , the God of Israel , says : Say this to your masters ,
» I used my great strength and my powerful arm to make the earth along with the people and the animals on it . I give it to anyone I please .
» Now I have handed all these countries over to my servant King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon . I have even made wild animals serve him .
» All nations will serve him , his son , and his grandson until Babylon is defeated . Then many nations and great kings will make him their slave .
» Suppose nations or kingdoms will not serve or surrender to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon . I will punish those nations by wars , famines , and plagues , until I have put an end to them by Nebuchadnezzar's power , « says Jehovah .
» Do not listen to prophets , mediums , and interpreters of dreams , fortunetellers , or sorcerers who tell you , ‘ You will never serve the king of Babylon . ’
» They prophesy lies to you . They will cause you to be taken far from your lands . I will scatter you , and you will die .
» If a nation surrender to the king of Babylon and serve him I will let it stay in its own land . People will farm the land and live on it , « says Jehovah . « ’ «
I spoke the same message to King Zedekiah of Judah : » Surrender to the king of Babylon , serve him and his people , and you will stay alive .
» Why should you and your people die in wars , famines , and plagues ? Jehovah has threatened the nations that do not serve the king of Babylon .
» Do not listen to the prophets who tell you , ‘ You will never serve the king of Babylon . ’ ’ They prophesy lies to you .
» I did not send them , « declares Jehovah . » They prophesy lies in my name . So I will scatter you , and you and the prophets will die . ’ «
I also spoke this message to the priests and all the people . This is what Jehovah said to me : » Do not listen to the prophets who tell you that the utensils of Jehovah’s Temple will be brought back from Babylon soon . They prophesy lies to you . «
» Do not listen to them . Instead , serve the king of Babylon , and live . Why should this city be turned into rubble ?
» If they are prophets and Jehovah is speaking to them , they should beg Jehovah of Hosts not to allow the utensils that are left in Jehovah’s Temple , in the royal palace of Judah , and in Jerusalem to be taken away to Babylon .
» Jehovah of Host reports concerning the pillars , concerning the sea , concerning the stands and concerning the rest of the vessels that are left in this city ,
which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take when he carried into exile Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim , king of Judah , from Jerusalem to Babylon , and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem .
‘ » Thus says Jehovah of Hosts , the God of Israel , concerning the vessels that are left in the House of Jehovah and in the house of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem ,
» They will be carried to Babylon and they will be there until the day I visit them , « declares Jehovah . » Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place . « ’ «
That same year , in the fifth month of the fourth year that Zedekiah was king , Hananiah son of Azzur , a prophet from the town of Gibeon , spoke to me in the Temple . In the presence of the priests and of the people he told me
that the Lord Jehovah , the God of Israel , said : » I have broken the power of the king of Babylon .
» Within two years I will bring back to this place all the temple treasures that King Nebuchadnezzar took to Babylon . ’ «
» ‘ I will also bring back the king of Judah , Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim , along with all of the people of Judah who went into exile in Babylon . I will break the power of the king of Babylon . ’ ’ I Jehovah have spoken ! ’ «
In the presence of the priests and of all the people who were standing in the Temple , I said to Hananiah :
» Amen ! I hope Jehovah will do this ! I certainly hope he will make the prophecy come true and will bring back from Babylon all the Temple treasures and all the people who were taken away as prisoners .
» But listen to what I say to you and to the people .
» The prophets who spoke long ago before my time and yours predicted that war , starvation , and disease would come to many nations and powerful kingdoms .
» A prophet who predicts peace can only be recognized as a prophet whom Jehovah has truly sent when that prophet's predictions come true . «
Hananiah took the yoke off my neck and broke it in pieces .
He said in the presence of all the people : » Jehovah said that this is how he will break the yoke that King Nebuchadnezzar has put on the neck of all the nations . He will do this within two years . « Then I left .
Some time after this Jehovah told me :
» Go and tell Hananiah : ‘ Jehovah has said , » You may be able to break a wooden yoke , but he will replace it with an iron yoke . «
» The Lord Jehovah , the God of Israel , said : ‘ He will put an iron yoke on all these nations and that they will serve King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon . Jehovah said that he would make even the wild animals serve Nebuchadnezzar . « ’ «
Then Jeremiah the prophet told the prophet Hananiah : » Listen , Hananiah ! Jehovah did not send you . You are making these people believe a lie .
» Because of this , Jehovah says : ‘ I am going to get rid of you . Before this year is over you will die because you have told the people to rebel against Jehovah . ’ «
Hananiah died in the seventh month of that same year .
The prophet Jeremiah sent a letter from Jerusalem to the rest of the leaders among the captives . He also sent it to the priests , the prophets , and all the people that Nebuchadnezzar took away as captives from Jerusalem to Babylon .
This was after King Jehoiakin and his mother , the court officials , the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem , the craftsmen , and metal workers left Jerusalem .
He sent the letter with Shaphan's son Elasah and Hilkiah's son Gemariah , whom King Zedekiah of Judah had sent to King Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon . The letter said :
» This is what Jehovah of Hosts , the God of Israel , says to all those who were taken captive from Jerusalem to Babylon :
‘ Build houses and live in them . Plant gardens and eat what they produce .
‘ Get married and have sons and daughters . Find wives for your sons and let your daughters get married so they can have sons and daughters . Grow in number there and do not decrease .
‘ Work for the good of the city where I have taken you as captives . Pray to Jehovah for that city . When it prospers , you will also prosper .
» This is what Jehovah of Hosts , the God of Israel , says : ‘ Do not let the prophets or the mediums among you trick you . Do not even listen to your own dreams .
‘ These people prophesy lies to you in my name . I did not send them , ’ ’ declares Jehovah .
» This is what Jehovah says : ‘ When Babylon's seventy years are over I will come to you . I will keep my promise to you and bring you back to this place .
‘ I know the plans that I have for you , says Jehovah . They are plans for peace and not disaster . They are plans to give you a future filled with hope .
‘ Then you will call to me . You will come and pray to me and I will hear you .
‘ When you look for me , you will find me . When you wholeheartedly seek me ,
‘ I will let you find me , declares Jehovah . I will bring you back from captivity . I will gather you from all the nations and places where I have scattered you , ’ ’ declares Jehovah . ‘ I will bring you back from the place where you are being held captive . ’
» You said , ‘ Jehovah gave us prophets in Babylon . ’
» This is what Jehovah says about the king who sits on David's throne . And this is what he says about all the people who live in this city , the people who are your relatives and who were not taken away as captives :
‘ Jehovah of Hosts says : » I am going to send them wars , famines , and plagues . These people are like rotten figs to me , figs that are so bad that they cannot be eaten .
» ‘ I will chase them with wars , famines , and plagues . I will make them a terror to all the kingdoms on the earth . They will become something cursed , ridiculed , and hissed at , and they will be a disgrace among all the nations where I scatter them .
‘ They did not listen to me , ’ ’ says Jehovah . ‘ I sent them my servants the prophets again and again , but they refused to listen , ’ ’ says Jehovah .
» Therefore listen to the word of Jehovah , all you captives who were sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon .
» This is what Jehovah of Hosts , the God of Israel , says about Kolaiah's son Ahab and about Maaseiah's son Zedekiah , who prophesy lies to you in my name : ‘ I am going to hand them over to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon . I will kill them as you watch .
‘ Because of them , all the captives from Judah who are in Babylon will use this curse : » May Jehovah curse you as he cursed Zedekiah and Ahab , whom the king of Babylon burned to death . «
They have done scandalous and disgraceful things in Israel . They committed adultery with their neighbors' wives and spoke lies in my name . I did not command them to do this . » ‘ » I know what they have done . I am a witness , « says Jehovah . ’ «
Jehovah says : » Say to Shemaiah from Nehelam ,
‘ This is what Jehovah of Hosts , the God of Israel , says : » You sent letters in your own name to all the people who are in Jerusalem , to the priest Zephaniah , son of Maaseiah , and to all the priests . These letters said :
‘ Jehovah made you priest instead of Jehoiada so that there would be officials for Jehovah’s temple . You should put every madman who acts like a prophet in prison and in shackles .
‘ Why have you not arrested Jeremiah from Anathoth ? After all , he acts like a prophet among you .
‘ That is why Jeremiah sent this message to us in Babylon : You will be captives a long time . Build houses , and live in them . Plant gardens , and eat what they produce , -- ’ « ’ « »
The priest Zephaniah read this letter to the prophet Jeremiah .
Then Jehovah spoke his word to Jeremiah . He said :
» Send this message to all the captives . This is what Jehovah says about Shemaiah from Nehelam : » Shemaiah prophesied to you , but I did not send him . He has made you believe a lie .
» Jehovah says : ‘ I will punish Shemaiah from Nehelam . I will also punish his descendants . No one from his family will be left alive . He will not see the blessings that I am going to send my people , ’ ’ declares Jehovah , ‘ because he has encouraged rebellion against Jehovah . ’ « ’ «
Jehovah spoke his word to Jeremiah :
This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says : » Write in a book everything that I tell you .
» The days are coming , « says Jehovah , » when I will bring my people Israel and Judah back from captivity . I will bring them back to the land that I gave their ancestors , and they will take possession of it . « ’
These are the words Jehovah spoke about Israel and Judah :
Jehovah said : » We hear cries of fear . We hear cries of panic . But we do not hear cries of peace .
» Ask now and see : Can a man give birth to a child ? Why , then , do I see every strong man holding his stomach in pain like a woman giving birth to a child ? Why has every face turned pale ?
» How terrible that day will be ! There will be no other day like it . It will be a time of calamity for the descendants of Jacob , but they will be rescued from it . «
» On that day , « declares Jehovah of Hosts , » I will break the yokes off your necks and tear off your ropes . Foreigners will no longer make you serve them .
» You will serve Jehovah your God and David your king . I will establish him for you . «
» Do not be afraid , my servant Jacob , « proclaims Jehovah . » Do not be terrified , Israel . I am going to rescue you from a faraway place . I am going to rescue your descendants from where they are captives . The descendants of Jacob will again have peace and security , and no one will frighten them . «
» I am with you . I will rescue you , « declares Jehovah . » I will completely destroy all the nations where I scattered you , but I will not completely destroy you . I will correct you with justice . I will not let you go entirely unpunished . «
This is what Jehovah says : » Your wound is incurable . Your injury is beyond healing .
» No one argues that you should be healed . But no medicine will heal you .
» All your lovers have forgotten you , and they do not want you anymore . I have punished you as an enemy would . I have corrected you as a cruel person would . You are very wicked , and you have many sins .
» Why do you cry about your wound , your injury that cannot be cured ? I have done this to you . You are very wicked , and you have many sins .
» That is why everyone who devours you will be devoured , and all your enemies will be taken away as captives . Those who looted you will be looted . Those who stole from you in war will have things stolen from them . «
» I will restore your health and heal your wounds , « proclaims Jehovah . » People call you an outcast : ‘ Zion , no one cares for you . ’ «
» This is what Jehovah says : » I am going to bring the captives back to Jacob's tents and show compassion on their homes . Cities will be built on the ruins , and fortified palaces will be built in their rightful place .
» The people who live there will sing songs of praise . The sound of laughter will be heard from there . I will make them numerous , and their number will not decrease . I will bring them honor , and they will not be considered unimportant .
» Their children will be like they were long ago . Their community will be established in my presence , and I will punish everyone who oppresses them .
» Their leader will be someone from their own people . Their ruler will come from among them . I will bring him near , and he will come close to me . Who would dare to come near me ? « Declares Jehovah .
» You will be my people , and I will be your God . «
The storm of Jehovah will come with his anger . Like a driving wind , it will swirl down on the heads of the wicked .
Jehovah’s burning rage will not turn back until he has done everything he intends to do . You will understand this clearly in the last days .
Jehovah proclaims : » At that time I will be the God of all the families of Israel , and they will be my people . «
Jehovah says : » The people who survived the sword war found favor in the wilderness . Israel went to find its rest . «
Jehovah appeared to him from afar , saying : » I have loved you with an everlasting love . Therefore I have drawn you with loving-kindness .
» I will build you and you will be rebuilt , O virgin of Israel ! You will take up your tambourines and go to the dances of the merrymakers .
» You will plant vineyards on the hills of Samaria . The planters will plant and will enjoy them .
» There will be a day when watchmen on the hills of Ephraim call out : ‘ Arise , and let us go up to Zion , to Jehovah our God . ’ «
Jehovah says : » Sing aloud with gladness for Jacob , and shout among the chief of the nations . « Proclaim ! Give praise and say , O Jehovah , save your people , the remnant of Israel .
I am bringing them from the North Country . I will gather them from the remote parts of the earth . Among them are the blind and the lame , the woman with child and she who is in labor with child . As a great company they will return here .
With weeping they will come . By supplication I will lead them . I will make them walk by streams of waters on a straight path in which they will not stumble . For I am a father to Israel and Ephraim is my firstborn .
Hear the word of Jehovah , O nations . Declare in the coastlands afar off . Say : » He who scattered Israel will gather him and keep him as a shepherd keeps his flock .
» Jehovah will free the descendants of Jacob and reclaim them from those who are stronger than they are .
» They will come and shout for joy on top of Mount Zion . They will stream to it to enjoy Jehovah’s blessings : fresh grain , new wine , olive oil , lambs and calves . Their lives will be like well-watered gardens , and they will never suffer again . «
» Then young women will rejoice and dance along with young men and old men . I will turn their mourning into joy . I will comfort them . I will replace their sorrow with joy .
» I will satisfy the priests with rich food . My people will be filled with my blessings , « proclaims Jehovah .
» This is what Jehovah says : ‘ A sound is heard in Ramah , the sound of crying in bitter grief . Rachel is crying for her children . She refuses to be comforted , because they are dead . ’ «
This is what Jehovah says : » ‘ Stop your crying , and wipe away your tears . You will be rewarded for your work , ’ ’ declares Jehovah . ‘ You will return from the land of the enemy . ’
» ‘ Your future is filled with hope , ’ ’ says Jehovah . ‘ Your children will return to their own territory . ’
» I hear the people of Israel say in grief , ‘ Jehovah , we were like an untamed animal , but you taught us to obey . Bring us back for we are ready to return to you , Jehovah our God .
» ‘ We turned away from you . But soon we wanted to return . After you had punished us we hung our heads in grief . We were ashamed and disgraced because we sinned when we were young . ’ «
» Ephraim , O Ephraim my dear delightful son ! Indeed , as often as I have spoken against him , I certainly still remember him . My heart yearns for him . I will surely have mercy on him , « declares Jehovah .
» Set up road marks . Place guideposts ! Direct your mind to the highway , the way by which you went . Return , O virgin of Israel . Return to these your cities .
» How long will you go here and there , O faithless daughter ? For Jehovah has created a new thing in the earth . A woman will protect a man . «
Jehovah of Hosts , the God of Israel says : » Once again they will speak this word in the land of Judah and in its cities when I restore their prosperity . They will say : ‘ Jehovah bless you , O abode of righteousness , O holy mountain ! ’
» Judah and all its cities will dwell together in it , the farmer and the shepherds with the flocks .
» For I satisfy the weary ones and refresh everyone filled with sorrow . «
At this , I woke up and looked around . My sleep had been pleasant .
Jehovah says : » The time is coming when I will plant the nations of Israel and Judah with people and animals . «
» I watched over them to uproot them and tear them down , to ruin and hurt them . Now I will watch over them to build them up . I will plant them , « says Jehovah .
» When that time comes people will no longer say : ‘ The fathers have eaten sour grapes , and their children’s teeth are set on edge . ’
» Each person will die for his own sin . Whoever eats sour grapes will have his own teeth set on edge . «
» The time is coming , « proclaims Jehovah , » when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah .
» It will not be like the promise that I made to their ancestors when I took them by the hand and brought them out of Egypt . They rejected that promise , although I was a husband to them , « says Jehovah .
» This is the covenant agreement that I will make with Israel after those days , « declares Jehovah . » I will put my teachings Law inside them . I will write those teachings Law on their hearts innerman mind will conscience understanding . I will be their God , and they will be my people . «
» No longer will each person teach his neighbors or his relatives by saying : ‘ Know Jehovah . ’ ’ » All of them , from the least important to the most important , will know me , « declares Jehovah . » I will forgive their wickedness and I will no longer hold remember their sins against them . «
Jehovah provides the sun to be a light during the day . He orders the moon and stars to be lights during the night . He stirs up the sea so that its waves roar . His name is Jehovah of Hosts . This is what Jehovah says :
» Only if this covenant is removed , « declares Jehovah , » will Israel's descendants stop being a nation in my presence . «
This is what Jehovah says : » ‘ If the heavens could be measured or the foundations of the earth could be searched , I would reject all of Israel's descendants because of everything that they have done , ’ ’ declares Jehovah . «
» The time is coming , « declares Jehovah , » when the city will be rebuilt for me from the Tower of Hananel to Corner Gate .
» A measuring line will stretch from there straight to the Hill of Gareb , and then it will turn to Goah .
» The whole valley is filled with its dead bodies and ashes . The entire area to the Kidron Valley , as far as the corner of Horse Gate in the east , will be holy to Jehovah . It will never be uprooted or torn down again . «
Jehovah spoke his word to Jeremiah during Zedekiah's tenth year as king of Judah . This was Nebuchadnezzar's eighteenth year as king .
At that time the army of the king of Babylon was blockading Jerusalem . The prophet Jeremiah was locked up in the courtyard of the prison . This prison was in the palace of the king of Judah .
When King Zedekiah of Judah locked up Jeremiah , Zedekiah asked him : » Why are you prophesying ? You are saying , ‘ this is what Jehovah says : » I am going to hand this city over to the king of Babylon , and he will capture it .
» King Zedekiah of Judah will not escape from the Babylonians . He will certainly be handed over to the king of Babylon . He will talk to Nebuchadnezzar in person and look him in the eye .
» Nebuchadnezzar will take Zedekiah to Babylon , and Zedekiah will stay there until I deal with him , « declares Jehovah . » When you fight the Babylonians , you will not win . « ’ «
Jeremiah said : » The word of Jehovah came to me . He said :
‘ Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle is coming to you . He says : » Buy for yourself my field at Anathoth , for you have the right of redemption to buy it . ’ «
» Then Hanamel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of Jehovah and said to me : ‘ Buy my field , please , that is at Anathoth , which is in the land of Benjamin . You have the right of possession and the redemption is yours ; . Buy it for yourself . ’ ’ » Then I knew that this was the word of Jehovah .
» I bought the field at Anathoth from Hanamel my uncle's son . I weighed out the silver for him , seventeen shekels of silver .
» I signed and sealed the deed , and called in witnesses , and weighed out the silver on the scales .
» I took the deeds of purchase , both the sealed copy containing the terms and conditions and the open copy .
» I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah , the son of Mahseiah , in the sight of Hanamel my uncle's son and in the sight of the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase , before all the Jews who were sitting in the court of the guard .
» I commanded Baruch in their presence , saying :
‘ Jehovah of Hosts , the God of Israel says : » Take these deeds , this sealed deed of purchase and this open deed , and put them in an earthenware jar , that they may be preserved a long time . «
‘ Jehovah of Host , the God of Israel says : » Houses and fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land . ’ «
» After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah I prayed to Jehovah :
‘ Ah Lord Jehovah ! You have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm ! Nothing is too difficult for you .
» You show loving kindness to thousands , but repay the iniquity of fathers into the bosom of their children after them . O great and mighty God . Jehovah of Hosts is his name .
» You are great in counsel and mighty in deed . Your eyes are open to all the ways of the sons of men . You give to everyone according to his ways and according to the fruit of his deeds .
» You set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt . Even to this day both in Israel and among mankind you have made a name for yourself .
» You brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt using signs and wonders . You did this with a strong hand , with an outstretched arm and with great terror .
» You gave them this land . You swore to their forefathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honey .
» They came in and took possession of it . But they did not obey your voice or walk in your Law . They have done nothing of all that you commanded them to do . Therefore you made this calamity come upon them .
» The siege ramps have reached the city to take it . The city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it , because of the sword , the famine and the pestilence . You brought all this disaster on them .
» Yet you , Lord Jehovah , told me to buy a field with money and get witnesses to confirm it , although the city was handed over to the Babylonians . «
Jehovah continued to speak his word to Jeremiah :
» Behold ! I am Jehovah the God of all humanity . Nothing is too hard for me .
» This is what Jehovah says : ‘ I am going to hand this city over to the Babylonians and King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon . They will capture it .
‘ The Babylonians who are attacking this city will break in , set this city on fire , and burn it down . They will burn down the houses of people who made me furious by going up to the roofs to burn incense to Baal and to pour out wine offerings to other gods . ’
» ‘ Ever since they were young , the people of Israel and Judah have done what I consider evil . The people of Israel have made me furious by what they have done , ’ ’ says Jehovah .
‘ The people in this city have made me so angry and furious from the day they built it to this day . So now I must remove this city from my presence .
The people of Israel and Judah have made me furious because they are evil . The people , their kings and officials , their priests and prophets , and the Judeans and those who live in Jerusalem
have turned their backs , not their faces to me . I taught them again and again , but they refused to listen and learn .
They set up their detestable idols in the Temple that is called by my name , and they dishonored it .
In the valley of Ben Hinnom they built worship sites for Baal to sacrifice their sons and daughters to Molech . I did not ask them to do this . It never entered my heart mind . I did not make Judah sin . ’
» You have said this about the city : Because of wars , famines , and plagues it will be handed over to the king of Babylon . Jehovah the God of Israel says :
‘ I am going to gather the people from all the lands where I scattered them in my anger , fury , and terrifying wrath . I will bring them back to this place and make them live here securely .
» They will be my people , and I will be their God .
» I will give them the same attitude and the same purpose so that they will respect and reverence me as long as they live . This will be for their good and for the good of their children .
» I will make an eternal promise to them that I will never stop blessing them . I will make them respect me so that they will never turn away from me .
» I will enjoy blessing them . With all my heart and all my being I will faithfully plant them in this land . ’ «
» This is what Jehovah says : ‘ As I brought all these disasters on these people , so I will bring on them all these blessings that I have promised them .
» Fields will be bought in this land of which you say : It is desolation , without man or beast ; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans . « ’
» ‘ Men will buy fields for money , sign and seal deeds , and call in witnesses in the land of Benjamin , in the environs of Jerusalem , in the cities of Judah , in the cities of the hill country , in the cities of the lowland and in the cities of the Negev . I will restore their prosperity , « declares Jehovah .
The word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah the second time , while he was still confined in the court of the guard :
» Jehovah is the maker of the earth . Jehovah is the one who formed and established it . Jehovah is His name .
‘ Call to me and I will answer you . I will tell you grand and impressive things , things you do not know . ’ «
» The houses in this city and the palaces of the kings of Judah have been torn down . They are used against the dirt ramps and weapons of the Babylonians . This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says about this :
» The people of Israel fought the Babylonians . Now their houses are filled with the bodies of their own people I killed in my anger and my fury . I will hide my face from this city because of its wickedness .
» However I will heal this city and restore it to health . I will heal its people , and I will give them peace and security .
» I will restore Judah and Israel and rebuild them as they were before .
» I will cleanse them from all the sins that they have committed against me . I will forgive them for all the sins that they have committed against me and for rebelling against me .
» Jerusalem will be my source of joy , praise , and honor . All the nations on earth will hear about all the blessings that I will give to Jerusalem . They will be afraid and tremble because of all the prosperity that I will provide for it . ’ «
» This is what Jehovah says : ‘ You have said that this place is ruined and that no people or animals live in it . It is true ! The cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem are deserted . No people or animals live there . But once again you will hear ,
» Yes , you will hear the sounds of joy and happiness and the sounds of brides and grooms . You will hear those who bring thank offerings to Jehovah’s Temple . « ’ » ‘ They will say : Give thanks to Jehovah of Hosts because Jehovah is good , because his mercy endures forever . I will restore the prosperity of the land to what they were before , « ’ says Jehovah .
» Jehovah of Hosts said : ‘ In this land that is like a desert and where no people or animals live , there will once again be pastures where shepherds can take their sheep . ’
» ‘ In mountain towns , in the foothills , and in southern Judah , in the territory of Benjamin , in the villages around Jerusalem , and in the towns of Judah , shepherds will once again count their sheep . ’ ’ I Jehovah have spoken . «
» ‘ Jehovah said : ‘ The time is coming when I will fulfill the promise that I made to the people of Israel and Judah .
» At that time I will choose as king a righteous descendant of David . That king will do what is right and just throughout the land .
» The people of Judah and of Jerusalem will be rescued and will live in safety . The city will be called Jehovah is Our Righteousness . ’ «
» I Jehovah promise that there will always be a descendant of David to be king of Israel
and that there will always be priests from the tribe of Levi to serve me and to offer burnt offerings , grain offerings , and sacrifices . ’ «
Jehovah continued to speak to me :
» If you break my covenant of the day and my covenant of the night , so that day and night will not be at their appointed time ,
then my covenant may also be broken with David my servant so that he will not have a son to reign on his throne , with the Levitical priests as my ministers .
» ‘ I will increase the descendants of my servant David and the Levites who serve me in the same way as the stars of heaven that cannot be counted and the sand on the seashore that cannot be measured . ’ «
The word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah :
» Have you not observed what this people have said . They say , ‘ The two families Jehovah chose , he has rejected ? ’ ’ Thus they despise my people , no longer are they as a nation in their sight .
» Jehovah says : ‘ If My covenant for day and night do not stand and I have not established the fixed patterns of heaven and earth ,
then I would reject the descendants of Jacob and David my servant . And I would not take from his descendants rulers over the descendants of Abraham , Isaac and Jacob . But I will restore their prosperity and will show them love and compassion . ’ «
Jehovah spoke his word to Jeremiah when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon , his entire army , and all the kingdoms and people that he ruled were attacking Jerusalem and all its cities . This is what he said :
» This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says : ‘ Go to King Zedekiah of Judah , and tell him , Jehovah says : » I am going to hand this city over to the king of Babylon . He will burn it down .
» You will not escape from him . You will certainly be captured and handed over to him . You will see the king of Babylon with your own eyes , and he will talk to you face to face . Then you will go to Babylon .
» Listen to the word of Jehovah , King Zedekiah of Judah . This is what Jehovah says about you : ‘ You will not die in war .
‘ You will die peacefully . People will burn funeral fires for you as they did for your ancestors , the kings who lived before you . ’ ’ They will say : » Oh , master , as they mourn for you . I have spoken my word , declares Jehovah . « ’ « ’ «
The prophet Jeremiah told all these things to King Zedekiah of Judah in Jerusalem .
He did this when the army of the king of Babylon was attacking Jerusalem and the cities of Lachish and Azekah . These were the only fortified cities of Judah that were left .
Jehovah spoke his word to Jeremiah after King Zedekiah and all the people in Jerusalem promised to free their slaves .
Everyone was supposed to free his Hebrew slaves , both male and female . No one was supposed to keep another Jew as a slave .
All the officials and all the people agreed and promised to free their male and female slaves and not to keep them as slaves anymore . So they set them free .
Later they changed their minds and took back the men and women they had freed and made them their slaves again .
Jehovah continued to speak his word to Jeremiah :
» This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says : ‘ I put a condition on the covenant I made to your ancestors when I brought them from Egypt , where they were slaves . I said :
» Every seven years each of you must free any Hebrews who sold themselves to you . When they have served you for six years , you must set them free . But your ancestors refused to obey me or listen to me .
» You changed and did what I consider right . You agreed to free your neighbors , and you made a covenant in my presence , in the Temple that is called by my name .
» Now you have changed again and dishonored me . You brought back the male and females slaves that you had set free to live their own lives . You have forced them to be your male and female slaves again . ’
» This is what Jehovah says : ‘ You did not obey me . You have not freed your relatives and neighbors . Now I am going to free you , ’ ’ declares Jehovah . ‘ I will free you to die in wars , plagues , and famines . I will make all the kingdoms of the world horrified at the thought of you .
I will hand over the people who have rejected my covenant . They have not kept the terms of the covenant they made in my presence when they cut a calf in two and passed between its pieces .
I will hand over the officials of Judah and Jerusalem , the palace officials , the priests , and all the common people who passed between the pieces of the calf .
I will hand them over to their enemies who want to kill them . Their corpses will be food for birds and wild animals .
I will hand King Zedekiah of Judah and his officials over to their enemies who want to kill them and to the army of the king of Babylon , the army that has withdrawn from you . ’
» ‘ I am going to give a command , ’ ’ declares Jehovah . ‘ I will bring that army back to this city to attack it , capture it , and burn it down . I will destroy the cities of Judah so that no one will live there . ’ «
This is the word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah , in the days of Jehoiakim , the son of Josiah , king of Judah :
» Go into the house of the Rechabites and talk to them . Take them into the House of Jehovah , into one of the rooms , and give them wine . «
I took Jaazaniah , the son of Jeremiah , the son of Habazziniah , and his brothers and all his sons and all the Rechabites .
I took them into the House of Jehovah , into the room of the sons of Hanan , the son of Igdaliah , the man of God . This was near the rulers' room , over the room of Maaseiah , the son of Shallum , the keeper of the door .
I set out some large bowls full of wine together with some cups . Then I said to the Rechabites : » Have some wine ! «
But they answered : » No ! The ancestor of our clan , Jonadab son of Rechab , made a rule that we must obey . He said : ‘ Do not ever drink wine
or build houses or plant crops and vineyards . Instead , you must always live in tents and move from place to place . If you obey this command , you will live a long time . ’
» We have obeyed all the instructions that Jonadab gave us . We never drink wine , and neither do our wives , our sons , or our daughters .
» We do not build houses for homes for we live in tents . We own no vineyards , fields , or grain . We have fully obeyed everything that our ancestor Jonadab commanded us .
» We live in tents , and we have obeyed everything our ancestor Jonadab ordered us to do .
» But when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon invaded this land , we said : ‘ Let's go to Jerusalem to escape the Babylonian and Aramean armies . That is why we are living in Jerusalem . ’ «
Then Jehovah spoke his word to Jeremiah . He said :
» This is what Jehovah of Hosts , the God of Israel , says : ‘ Tell the people of Judah and those who live in Jerusalem , Will you ever learn your lesson and obey my words ? « Declares Jehovah .
» Jonadab , Rechab's son , ordered his descendants not to drink wine . This order has been carried out . His descendants have not drunk any wine to this day , because they have obeyed their ancestor's order . I have spoken to you again and again , but you have refused to listen to me .
» I have sent all my servants the prophets to you again and again . They said : Turn from your evil ways , do what is right , and do not follow other gods in order to serve them . Then you will live in the land that I gave you and your ancestors . However , you refused to listen to me or obey me .
» The descendants of Jonadab , Rechab's son , have carried out the orders of their ancestor , but you refuse to listen to me . « ’ «
» This is what Jehovah of Hosts , the God of Israel , says : ‘ I am going to bring on Judah and on all those who live in Jerusalem all the disasters that I threatened . I have spoken to them , but they did not listen . I called to them , but they did not answer . ’ «
Then Jeremiah said to the family of Rechab : » This is what Jehovah of Hosts , the God of Israel , says : ‘ You obeyed the order of your ancestor Jonadab , followed all his instructions , and did exactly what he told you to do .
So this is what Jehovah of Hosts , the God of Israel , says : » A descendant of Jonadab , Rechab's son , will always serve me . « ’ «
In the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim , son of King Josiah of Judah , Jehovah spoke his word to Jeremiah :
» Take a scroll , and write on it everything that I have dictated to you about Israel , Judah , and all the other nations from the time I spoke to you during the reign of Josiah until today .
» Maybe the nation of Judah will hear about all the disasters that I devise to bring on them , and they will turn from their wicked ways . Then I will forgive their wickedness and their sins . «
Then Jeremiah called Baruch , son of Neriah . Jeremiah dictated everything that Jehovah told him . Baruch wrote it all down on a scroll .
Jeremiah told Baruch : » I am no longer allowed to go to Jehovah’s Temple .
» On a day of fasting , you must read from the scroll Jehovah’s message that you wrote as I dictated . You must read it to the people in Jehovah’s Temple . You must also read it to all the people of Judah when they come from their cities .
» Maybe their prayers will come into Jehovah’s presence , and they will turn from their evil ways . Jehovah has threatened these people with his terrifying anger and fury . «
Baruch , son of Neriah , did as the prophet Jeremiah commanded him . In Jehovah’s Temple he read from the scroll everything that Jehovah had said .
In the ninth month of the fifth year of the reign of Jehoiakim , son of King Josiah of Judah , a time for fasting was called . It was a time for all the people in Jerusalem and for everyone who was coming from any city in Judah to Jerusalem to fast in Jehovah’s presence .
Then Baruch read the scroll containing the words of Jeremiah . Baruch read it to all the people in Jehovah’s temple in the room of the scribe Gemariah , son of Shaphan , in the upper courtyard at the entrance of New Gate of Jehovah’s Temple .
Micaiah , who was the son of Gemariah and the grandson of Shaphan , heard Baruch read from the scroll everything Jehovah had said .
Then he went down to the scribe's room in the king's palace where all the scribes were sitting . The scribe Elishama , Delaiah son of Shemaiah , Elnathan son of Achbor , Gemariah son of Shaphan , Zedekiah son of Hananiah , and all the other officials were there .
Micaiah told them everything he heard Baruch read from the scroll publicly .
Then all the officials sent Jehudi , who was the son of Nethaniah , the grandson of Shelemiah , and the great-grandson of Cushi , to Baruch . Jehudi said to Baruch : » Bring the scroll that you read publicly , and come with me . « Baruch , son of Neriah , took the scroll and went with him to see the officers .
They said to Baruch : » Please sit down , and read it to us . « So Baruch read it to them .
When they heard everything , they turned to each other in terror . They said to Baruch : » We must tell the king everything . «
They asked Baruch : » Please tell us how you wrote all this . Did Jeremiah dictate it to you ? «
Baruch answered : » He dictated everything to me , and I wrote it on the scroll in ink . «
The officials said to Baruch : » You and Jeremiah must hide . Do not let anyone know where you are . «
After they put the scroll in the side room of the scribe Elishama , they went to the king in the courtyard and told him everything .
Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll . He took the scroll from the side room of the scribe Elishama . Jehudi read it to the king and all the officials standing by the king .
It was the ninth month , and the king was in his winter house sitting in front of the fire in the fireplace .
As Jehudi read three or four columns , the king would cut them off with a scribe's knife and throw them into the fire in the fireplace . He did this until the whole scroll was burned up .
The king and all his attendants did not show any fear or tear their clothes in fear when they heard everything being read .
Even when Elnathan , Delaiah , and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll , he refused to listen to them .
The king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son , Seraiah son of Azriel , and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest the scribe Baruch and the prophet Jeremiah . But Jehovah had hidden Baruch and Jeremiah .
After the king burned up the scroll that Baruch had written and that Jeremiah had dictated , Jehovah spoke his word to Jeremiah :
» Take another scroll , and write on it everything that was written on the scroll that King Jehoiakim of Judah burned .
» Say about King Jehoiakim of Judah : ‘ This is what Jehovah says : You burned this scroll , and you asked Jeremiah : » Why did you write that the king of Babylon would certainly come to destroy this land and take away people and animals ? « ’ «
» ‘ This is what Jehovah says about King Jehoiakim of Judah : ‘ He will have no one to sit on David's throne , and his own corpse will be thrown out and exposed to the heat of day and the cold of night .
‘ » ‘ » I will punish him , his descendants , and his attendants for their wickedness . They refused to listen . So I will bring on them , on those who live in Jerusalem , and on the people of Judah all the disasters that I have threatened . ’ « ’ «
Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch , son of Neriah . As Jeremiah dictated , Baruch wrote on it everything that was on the scroll that King Jehoiakim of Judah had burned . They added many similar messages .
King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon appointed Zedekiah , son of Josiah , to be king of Judah . Zedekiah succeeded Jehoiakin , son of Jehoiakim .
Zedekiah , his administrators , and the common people did not listen to what Jehovah spoke through the prophet Jeremiah .
King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to the prophet Jeremiah . They asked him : » Please pray to Jehovah our God for us . «
Jeremiah was still free to come and go among the people . The people of Jerusalem had not put him in prison yet .
Pharaoh's army came from Egypt . When the Babylonians who were blockading Jerusalem heard this news , they retreated from Jerusalem .
Jehovah spoke his word to the prophet Jeremiah :
» This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says : ‘ Say this to the king of Judah , who sent you to get advice from me : » Pharaoh's army has come out to help you . But it will go back to Egypt , its own land .
» Then the Babylonians will return . They will attack the city , capture it , and burn it down . «
» Jehovah says : ‘ Do not deceive yourselves by thinking that the Babylonians will leave you . They will not leave you .
» Even if you would defeat the entire Babylonian army so that they had only a few badly wounded men left in their tents , they would get up and burn down this city ! « ’ «
The Babylonian army retreated from Jerusalem because Pharaoh's army was coming .
Jeremiah wanted to leave Jerusalem and go to the territory of Benjamin to take possession of his property there among the people .
When he came to Benjamin Gate , the captain of the guard there , whose name was Irijah , son of Shelemiah and grandson of Hananiah , arrested the prophet Jeremiah . He said : » You are deserting to the Babylonians ! «
Jeremiah answered : » That is not true ! I am not deserting to the Babylonians . « But Irijah would not listen to him . Irijah arrested Jeremiah and took him to the officials .
The officials were so angry with Jeremiah that they beat him and put him in prison in the scribe Jonathan's house , which had been turned into a prison .
Jeremiah went into a prison cell , and he stayed there a long time .
Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah , and the king asked him privately in the palace : » Is there any message from Jehovah ? Jeremiah answered : Yes ! There is a message from Jehovah . You will be handed over to the king of Babylon . «
Then Jeremiah asked King Zedekiah : » What crime have I committed against you , your administrators , or these people ? Why have you put me in prison ?
» Where are the prophets who told you that the king of Babylon would not attack you and this land ?
» Your Majesty , please listen , and accept my plea for mercy . Do not return me to the scribe Jonathan's house , or I will die there . «
King Zedekiah gave the command to have Jeremiah put in the courtyard of the prison . He gave him a loaf of bread every day from the bakers' street until all the bread in the city was gone . So Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the prison .
Shephatiah son of Mattan , Gedaliah son of Pashhur , Jehucal son of Shelemiah , and Pashhur son of Malchiah heard what I was telling the people .
» Jehovah says : ‘ Whoever stays on in the city will die in war or of starvation or disease . But those who go out and surrender to the Babylonians will not be killed . They will at least escape with their life . ’
» I also told them that Jehovah said : ‘ I am going to give the city to the Babylonian army , and they will capture it . ’ «
The officials went to the king and said : » This man must be put to death . By talking like this he is making the soldiers in the city lose their courage . He is doing the same thing to everyone else left in the city . He is not trying to help the people . He only wants to hurt them . «
King Zedekiah answered : » Very well , then , do what you want to with him . I cannot stop you . «
So they took me and let me down by ropes into Prince Malchiah's well , which was in the palace courtyard . There was no water in the well , only mud , and I sank down in it .
Ebedmelech the Ethiopian , a eunuch officer who worked in the royal palace , heard that they had put me in the well . At that time the king was holding court at the Benjamin Gate .
So Ebedmelech went there and said to the king :
» Your Majesty , what these men have done is wrong . They have put Jeremiah in the well , where he is sure to die of starvation , since there is no more food in the city . «
Then the king ordered Ebedmelech the Ethiopian , » Take with you three men and to pull him out of the well before he dies . «
So Ebedmelech went with the men to the palace storeroom and got some worn-out clothing which he let down to me by ropes .
He told me to put the rags under my arms , so that the ropes would not hurt me . I did this .
So they pulled me up out of the well . After that I was kept in the courtyard .
On another occasion King Zedekiah had me brought to him at the third entrance to the temple . He said : » I am going to ask you a question , and I want you to tell me the whole truth . «
I answered : » If I tell you the truth , you will put me to death , and if I give you advice , you will not pay any attention . «
So King Zedekiah promised me in secret : » I swear by the living God , the God who gave us life , that I will not put you to death or hand you over to the men who want to kill you . «
Then I told Zedekiah that Jehovah , the God of Israel said : » If you surrender to the king of Babylon’s officers , your life will be spared , and this city will not be burned down . Both you and your family will be spared .
» But if you do not surrender , then this city will be handed over to the Babylonians . They will burn it down , and you will not escape from them . «
The king answered : » I am afraid of our own people who have deserted to the Babylonians . I may be handed over to them and tortured . «
I said : » You will not be handed over to them . I beg you to obey Jehovah’s message . Then all will go well with you , and your life will be spared .
» Jehovah has shown me in a vision what will happen if you refuse to surrender .
» In it I saw all the women left in Judah's royal palace being led out to the king of Babylonia's officers . Listen to what they were saying as they went . The king's best friends misled him , they overruled him . And now that his feet have sunk in the mud , his friends have left him . «
Then I added : » All your women and children will be taken out to the Babylonians . You will not escape from them . You will be taken prisoner by the king of Babylonia . And this city will be burned to the ground . «
Zedekiah replied : » Do not let anyone know about this conversation , and your life will not be in danger .
» If the officials hear that I have talked with you , they will come and ask you what we said . They will promise not to put you to death if you tell them everything .
» Just tell them you were begging me not to send you back to prison to die there . «
Then all the officials came and questioned me . I told them exactly what the king had told me to say . There was nothing else they could do , because no one had overheard the conversation .
I was kept in the palace courtyard until the day Jerusalem was captured .
In the tenth month of the ninth year that Zedekiah was king of Judah , King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia came with his whole army and attacked Jerusalem .
On the ninth day of the fourth month of Zedekiah's eleventh year as king , the city walls were broken through .
When Jerusalem was captured , all the high officials of the king of Babylon came and took their places at the Middle Gate , including Nergal Sharezer , Samgar Nebo , Sarsechim , and another Nergal Sharezer .
When King Zedekiah and all his soldiers saw what was happening , they tried to escape from the city during the night . They left by way of the royal garden , went through the gateway connecting the two walls , and escaped in the direction of the Jordan Valley .
But the Babylonian army pursued them and captured Zedekiah in the plains near Jericho . Then they took him to King Nebuchadnezzar , who was in the city of Riblah in the territory of Hamath , and there Nebuchadnezzar passed sentence on him .
At Riblah he put Zedekiah's sons to death while Zedekiah was looking on , and he also had the officials of Judah executed .
After that , he had Zedekiah's eyes put out and had him placed in chains to be taken to Babylon .
The Babylonians burned down the royal palace and the houses of the people and tore down the walls of Jerusalem .
Finally Nebuzaradan , the commanding officer , took away as prisoners to Babylon the people who were left in the city , together with those who had deserted to him .
He left in the land of Judah some of the poorest people , who owned no property , and he gave them vineyards and fields .
But King Nebuchadnezzar commanded Nebuzaradan , the commanding officer , to give the following order :
Go and find Jeremiah and take good care of him . Do not harm him , but do for him whatever he wants .
So Nebuzaradan , together with the high officials Nebushazban and Nergal Sharezer and all the other officers of the king of Babylon ,
had me brought from the palace courtyard . They put me under the care of Gedaliah , the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan , who was to see that I got home safely . Thus I stayed there among the people .
While I was still imprisoned in the palace courtyard , Jehovah told me :
» Tell Ebedmelech the Ethiopian that Jehovah , the God of Israel , said : ‘ Just as I said I would , I am going to bring upon this city destruction and not prosperity . When this happens , you will be there to see it .
» ‘ I Jehovah will protect you , and you will not be handed over to the people you are afraid of .
» ‘ I will keep you safe , and you will not be put to death . You will escape with your life because you have put your trust in me . I Jehovah have spoken ! ’ «
Jehovah spoke his word to Jeremiah after Nebuzaradan , the captain of the guard , let him go at Ramah . Nebuzaradan found Jeremiah in chains along with the captives of Jerusalem and Judah who were being taken to Babylon .
The captain of the guard took Jeremiah aside and said to him : » Jehovah your God threatened to bring this disaster on this place .
» He has carried out his threat . Jehovah did as he promised because you Israelites have sinned against him and refused to obey him . That is why this has happened to you .
» Today , I am removing the chains from your hands . If you would like to come with me to Babylon , come , and I will look after you . But if you do not want to come with me to Babylon , do not come . The whole land is yours . Go wherever you want . «
If you wish to remain , then go back to Gedaliah , son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan , whom the king of Babylon appointed to govern the cities of Judah . Live among the people with him , or go anywhere you want . The captain of the guard gave Jeremiah some food and a present and let him go .
Jeremiah went to Gedaliah , son of Ahikam , at Mizpah and lived with him among the people who were left in the land .
All the army commanders and their men who were in the field heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah , son of Ahikam , to govern the country and some of the country's poorest men , women , and children who had not been taken away to Babylon .
These are the commanders who went with their men to Gedaliah at Mizpah : Ishmael son of Nethaniah , Johanan and Jonathan sons of Kareah , Seraiah son of Tanhumeth , the sons of Ephai from Netophah , and Jezaniah , who was the son of a man from Maacah .
Gedaliah , son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan , swore an oath to them and their men . He said : » Do not be afraid to serve the Babylonians . Live in this country , serve the king of Babylon , and you will prosper .
» I am going to live in Mizpah and represent you when the Babylonians come to us . Gather grapes , summer fruit , and olive oil , and put them in storage jars . Live in the cities you have taken over . «
All the Jews who were in Moab , Ammon , Edom , and in all the other countries heard that the king of Babylon had left a few survivors in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah , son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan , to govern them .
So all the Jews returned from all the places where they had been scattered . They came to Judah and to Gedaliah at Mizpah . They gathered a large harvest of grapes and summer fruit .
Kareah's son Johanan and all the army commanders who were still in the country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah .
They asked him : » Do you know that King Baalis of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael , Nethaniah's son , to kill you ? « However , Gedaliah , son of Ahikam , did not believe them .
Then Johanan , Kareah's son , secretly asked Gedaliah at Mizpah : » Let me kill Ishmael , Nethaniah's son . No one will know about it . Why should he kill you ? All the Jews who have gathered around you would scatter . What is left of Judah would disappear . «
Gedaliah , son of Ahikam , told Johanan , Kareah's son : » Do not do that ! What you are saying about Ishmael is a lie . «
In the seventh month Ishmael son of Nethaniah and grandson of Elishama , a descendant of the royal family and of the king's officers went with ten men to Gedaliah , son of Ahikam , at Mizpah . As they ate together at Mizpah ,
Ishmael , son of Nethaniah , and the ten men who were with him got up , drew their swords , and killed Gedaliah , son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan . So they assassinated the man whom the king of Babylon had appointed to govern the land .
Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah as well as the Babylonian soldiers that he found there .
The day after the murder of Gedaliah , before anyone knew about it ,
Eighty men arrived from Shechem , Shiloh , and Samaria . Their beards were shaved off , their clothes were torn , and cuts were on their bodies . They brought grain offerings and incense to Jehovah’s Temple .
Ishmael , son of Nethaniah , left Mizpah to meet them . He was crying as he went . When he met them , he said to them : » Come to Gedaliah , son of Ahikam . «
When they came into the city , Ishmael , son of Nethaniah , and his men slaughtered them and threw them into a cistern .
Ten men from the group pleaded with Ishmael : » Do not kill us ! We have wheat , barley , olive oil , and honey hidden in the country . « So he left them alone and did not kill them along with the others .
The cistern where Ishmael threw all the bodies of the men he had killed was the same one that King Asa made as a part of his defense against King Baasha of Israel . Ishmael , son of Nethaniah , filled it with the bodies .
Then Ishmael took captive the rest of the people who were at Mizpah . He captured the king's daughters and all the other people who had been left at Mizpah . They were the people whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had put under the control of Gedaliah son of Ahikam . Ishmael son of Nethaniah took them captive and left for Ammon .
When Kareah's son Johanan and all the army commanders who were with him heard about all the crimes Ishmael son of Nethaniah did ,
they took all their men and went to fight Ishmael . They caught up with him at the large pool in Gibeon .
When all the people who were with Ishmael saw Kareah's son Johanan and all the army commanders who were with him , they were glad .
Then all the people Ishmael had taken captive at Mizpah turned and ran to Kareah's son Johanan .
Ishmael and eight of his men escaped from Johanan and fled to Ammon .
Then Kareah's son Johanan and all the army commanders who were with him brought back the rest of the people of Mizpah whom he had rescued from Ishmael , son of Nethaniah , after Ishmael had killed Gedaliah , son of Ahikam . Johanan brought back men , women , children , soldiers , and commanders from Gibeon .
When they left Gibeon , they stayed near Bethlehem at Geruth Kimham on their way to Egypt .
They were afraid of the Babylonians because Ishmael had killed Gedaliah whom the king of Babylon had appointed to govern the land .
All the army leaders , including Johanan son of Kareah and Azariah son of Hoshaiah , came with people of every class .
They said to me : » Please do what we ask you ! Pray to Jehovah our God for us . Pray for all of us who have survived . Once there were many of us . Now there are only a few of us left , as you can see .
» Pray that Jehovah our God will show us the way we should go and what we should do . «
I answered : » Very well , then . I will pray to Jehovah our God , just as you have asked . I will tell you what he says . I will not keep back anything from you . «
Then they said to me : » May Jehovah be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not obey all the commandments that Jehovah our God gives you for us .
» Whether it pleases us or not , we will obey Jehovah our God , to whom we are asking you to pray . All will go well with us if we obey him . «
Ten days later Jehovah spoke to me .
I called together Johanan , all the army leaders who were with him , and all the other people .
I said to them , » Jehovah , the God of Israel , to whom you sent me with your request said :
‘ If you are willing to go on living in this land I will build you up and not tear you down . I will plant you and not uproot you . The destruction I brought on you has caused me great sorrow .
‘ Stop being afraid of the king of Babylon . I am with you . I will rescue you from his power . ’
For the reason that I am merciful , I will make him have mercy on you and let you go back home . I Jehovah have spoken .
» ‘ If you say : » We will not stay in this land , and you disobey Jehovah your God . «
Then you say : » We will go to Egypt , where we will not have to see war , hear the sound of a ram's horn , or be hungry . We will stay there . «
Listen to the word of Jehovah , you people who are left in Judah . This is what Jehovah of Hosts , the God of Israel , says : » Suppose you are determined to go to Egypt , and you go and live there .
» Then the war that you fear will overtake you , and the hunger you dread will follow you , and you will die there in Egypt .
» All the people who are determined to go and live in Egypt will die either in war or of starvation or disease . Not one of them will survive , not one will escape the disaster that I am going to bring on them . « ’
» Jehovah , the God of Israel , says : ‘ Just as my anger and fury were poured out on the people of Jerusalem , so my fury will be poured out on you if you go to Egypt . You will be a horrifying sight . People will make fun of you and use your name as a curse . You will never see this place again . ’
» Then I continued : Jehovah has told you people who are left in Judah not to go to Egypt . And so I warn you now .
» You are making a fatal mistake . You asked me to pray to Jehovah our God for you , and you promised that you would do everything that he commands .
» Now I have told you , but you are disobeying everything that Jehovah our God sent me to tell you .
» So then , remember this : you will die in war or of starvation or disease in the land where you want to go and live . «
As soon as Jeremiah , whom Jehovah their God had sent , had finished telling all the people all the words of Jehovah their God , that is , all these words ,
Azariah the son of Hoshaiah , and Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the arrogant egotistical men said to Jeremiah : » You are telling a lie ! Jehovah our God has not sent you to say : ‘ You are not to enter Egypt to reside there . «
Baruch the son of Neriah is inciting you against us to give us over into the hand of the Chaldeans . They will put us to death or exile us to Babylon .
So Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces , and all the people , did not obey the voice of Jehovah and stay in the land of Judah .
But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces took the entire remnant of Judah who had returned from all the nations to which they had been driven away , in order to reside in the land of Judah .
They took men , women , children , and the king's daughters . They took every person whom Nebuzaradan , the captain of the guard , had left with Gedaliah , son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan , including the prophet Jeremiah and Baruch , son of Neriah .
They did not listen to Jehovah . They went to Egypt . They went as far as Tahpanhes .
Then Jehovah spoke his word to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes . He said :
» Take some large stones , and bury them under the brick pavement at the entrance to the Pharaoh's palace in Tahpanhes . Do this while the people of Judah watch you .
» Say to them : ‘ This is what Jehovah of Hosts , the God of Israel , says : I am going to send for my servant King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon . I will set his throne over these stones that I buried , and I will spread his royal canopy above them .
» He will defeat Egypt . He will bring death to those who are supposed to die . He will capture those who are supposed to be captured . He will kill in battle those who are supposed to be killed in battle .
» He will set fire to the temples of Egypt's gods . He will burn down the temples and take their gods captive . Nebuchadnezzar will put on Egypt as his coat as a shepherd puts on his coat . He will leave Egypt peacefully .
» At Beth Shemesh he will break the monuments in Egypt and burn down the temples of Egypt's gods . « ’ «
Jehovah spoke to me concerning all the Israelites living in Egypt , in the cities of Migdol , Tahpanhes , and Memphis , and in the southern part of the country «
» Jehovah , the God of Israel , said : ‘ You have seen the destruction I brought on Jerusalem and all the other cities of Judah . Even now they are still in ruins , and no one lives in them .
» ‘ This is because their people had done evil and had made me angry . They offered sacrifices to other gods and served gods that neither they nor you nor your ancestors ever worshiped .
» ‘ I kept sending you my servants the prophets , who told you not to do this terrible thing that I hate .
» ‘ But you would not listen or pay any attention . You would not give up your evil practice of sacrificing to other gods .
» ‘ I poured out my anger and fury on the towns of Judah and on the streets of Jerusalem . I set them on fire . They were left in ruins and became a horrifying sight , as they are today . ’ «
» I Jehovah , the God of Israel , says : ‘ Now ask why you are doing such an evil thing to yourselves . Do you want to bring destruction on men and women , children and babies , so that none of your people will be left ?
» ‘ Why do you make me angry by worshiping idols and by sacrificing to other gods here in Egypt , where you have come to live ? Are you doing this just to destroy yourselves , so that every nation on earth will make fun of you and use your name as a curse ?
» ‘ Have you forgotten all the wicked things that have been done in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem by your ancestors , by the kings of Judah and their wives , and by you and your wives ?
» ‘ You have not humbled yourselves to this very day . You have not honored me or lived according to all the laws that I gave you and your ancestors . ’ «
» I Jehovah , the God of Israel , will turn against you and destroy all Judah .
» As for the people of Judah who are left and are determined to go and live in Egypt , I will see to it that all of them are destroyed . All of them , great and small will die in Egypt , either in war or of starvation . They will be a horrifying sight . People will make fun of them and use their name as a curse .
» I will punish those who live in Egypt , just as I punished Jerusalem with the sword war , starvation , and disease .
» None of the people of Judah who are left and have come to Egypt to live will escape or survive . Not one of them will return to Judah , where they long to live once again . No one will return except a few refugees . ’ «
Then all the men who knew that their wives offered sacrifices to other gods , and all the women who were standing there , including the Israelites who lived in southern Egypt , a large crowd in all said to me :
» We refuse to listen to what you have told us in the name of Jehovah .
» We will do everything that we said we would . We will offer sacrifices to our goddess , the Queen of Heaven , and we will pour out wine offerings to her , just as our ancestors , our king and our leaders , and we used to do in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem . Then we had plenty of food , we were prosperous , and had no troubles .
» Ever since we stopped sacrificing to the Queen of Heaven and stopped pouring out wine offerings to her , we have had nothing , and our people have died in war and of starvation .
» The women added : ‘ When we baked cakes shaped like the Queen of Heaven , offered sacrifices to her , and poured out wine offerings to her , our husbands approved of what we were doing . ’ «
Then I said to all the men and the women who had answered me in this way :
» About the sacrifices you and your ancestors , your kings and your leaders , and the people of the land offered in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem : do you think that Jehovah did not know about them or that he forgot them ?
» This very day your land lies in ruins and no one lives in it . It has become a horrifying sight . People use its name as a curse because Jehovah could no longer endure your wicked and evil practices .
» This present disaster has come on you because you offered sacrifices to other gods and sinned against Jehovah by not obeying all his commandments . «
» I told all the people , especially the women , what Jehovah , the God of Israel , was saying to the people of Judah living in Egypt .
» Both you and your wives have made solemn promises to the Queen of Heaven . You promised that you would offer sacrifices to her and pour out wine offerings to her , and you have kept your promises . Very well , then ! Keep your promises ! Carry out your vows !
» But now listen to the vow that I , Jehovah , have made in my mighty name to all you in Judah and in Egypt : ‘ Never again will I let any of you use my name to make a vow by saying : » I swear by the living God , Jehovah ! ’ «
» I will see to it that you will not prosper , but will be destroyed . All of you will die ! You will die in war or of disease , until not one of you is left .
» But a few of you will escape death and return from Egypt to Judah . Then the survivors will know whose words have come true , mine or theirs .
» ‘ I Jehovah will give you proof that I will punish you in this place and that my promise to bring destruction on you will come true .
» Jehovah says , ‘ I will hand over King Hophra of Egypt to his enemies who want to kill him , just as I handed over King Zedekiah of Judah to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon , who was his enemy and wanted to kill him . « ’ «
This is the message that the prophet Jeremiah spoke to Baruch , son of Neriah . Baruch wrote these things on a scroll book as Jeremiah dictated them during the fourth year that Jehoiakim , son of Josiah , was king of Judah . Jeremiah said :
» This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says to you , Baruch :
You said : » I am so miserable ! Jehovah has added grief to my pain . I am worn out from groaning . I cannot find any rest . «
» Say this to Baruch : ‘ This is what Jehovah says : » I will tear down what I have built . I will uproot what I have planted throughout the earth .
» Are you looking for great things for yourself ? Do not look for them . « » I am going to bring disaster on all people ! « Declares Jehovah , » But wherever you go I will let you escape with your life . «
Jehovah spoke this message to the prophet Jeremiah about the nations .
This is the message about EGYPT , about the army of Pharaoh Neco , king of Egypt . King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon defeated his army at Carchemish along the Euphrates River during the fourth year that Jehoiakim , son of Josiah , was king of Judah .
» Get your large and small shields ready and advance into battle .
» Harness your horses . Mount up , you horsemen . Take your positions , and put on your helmets . Polish your spears . Put on your armor .
» What do I see in them ? They are terrified . They are retreating . Their warriors are defeated . They flee without looking back . Terror is all around them ! « declares Jehovah .
The infantry cannot flee . The warriors cannot escape . They stumble and fall in the north by the Euphrates River .
Who is this , rising like the Nile River , like streams that flow swiftly ?
Egypt is like the rising Nile River , like a river quickly overflowing its banks . Egypt says : » I will rise . I will cover the earth . I will destroy cities and the people in them . «
Go into battle , you horsemen . Drive wildly , you chariot drivers . March into battle , you warriors , you warriors from Sudan and Put who carry shields , you warriors from Lydia who use bows and arrows .
That day belongs to Jehovah of Hosts . It is a day of vengeance when he will take revenge on his enemies . His sword will devour until it has had enough , and it will drink their blood until it is full . The Almighty Jehovah of Hosts will offer them as sacrifices in the north by the Euphrates River .
Go to Gilead , and get medicine , dear people of Egypt . You have used many medicines without results and cannot be cured .
The nations have heard of your shame . Your cry fills the earth . One warrior will stumble over another , and both will fall together .
Jehovah spoke this message to the prophet Jeremiah about the coming of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon , who will defeat Egypt .
» Tell this in Egypt . Announce this in Migdol . Make it known in Memphis and in Tahpanhes . Say : ‘ Take your positions , and get ready . Swords will kill those around you .
» Why should your soldiers be cut down ? They cannot stand because Jehovah will push them down .
« They have repeatedly stumbled and now they have fallen . They say to each other : ‘ Get up ! Let us go back to our people , to the land where we were born and escape our enemy's sword . ’ «
» There they will cry : ‘ Pharaoh , king of Egypt , is a big windbag . He has missed his chance . ’
» ‘ As I live , ’ ’ declares the king , whose name is Jehovah of Hosts ; ‘ someone who is like Mount Tabor among the mountains will come . Someone who is like Mount Carmel by the sea will come .
» ‘ Pack your bags inhabitants of Egypt , because you will be taken away as captives . Memphis will become a dreary wasteland , a pile of rubble where no one lives .
» ‘ Egypt is like a beautiful cow , but a horsefly distruction from the north will attack it .
» ‘ Egypt's hired soldiers are like fattened calves . They will turn and run away together . They will not stand their ground . The day of destruction is coming . At that time they will be punished . ’
» ‘ Egypt will hiss like a snake as it slithers away . Its enemies will come with full force . They will attack it with axes like those who chop wood .
» ‘ They will cut down the forest , ’ ’ declares Jehovah , ‘ since Egypt cannot be found . They are more numerous than locusts . They cannot be counted .
» ‘ The people of Egypt will be put to shame . They will be handed over to the people from the north . ’
» Jehovah of Hosts , the God of Israel , says : ‘ I am going to punish Amon , who is the god of Thebes . I will also punish Pharaoh , Egypt , its gods , its kings , and whoever trusts Pharaoh . ’
» ‘ I will hand them over to those who want to kill them , to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and his officers . Afterward , they will live in peace as they did long ago , ’ declares Jehovah .
» ‘ Do not be afraid , my servant Jacob . Do not be terrified , Israel . I am going to rescue you and your descendants from a faraway land , from the land where you are captives . Then Jacob's descendants will again have undisturbed peace , and no one will make them afraid .
» ‘ Do not be afraid , my servant Jacob , « declares Jehovah . » I am with you . I will completely destroy all the nations where I scattered you , but I will not completely destroy you . I will correct you with justice . I will not let you go entirely unpunished . ’ «
That which came as the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the PHILISTINES , before Pharaoh conquered Gaza .
Jehovah says : » Behold ! Waters are going to rise from the north and become an overflowing torrent . They will overflow flood the land and all its fullness , the city and those who live in it and the men will cry out . Every inhabitant of the land will wail .
» They will hear the sound of galloping warhorses , the rattling of enemy chariots , and the rumbling of their wheels . Fathers who lack courage abandon their children .
The time has come to destroy all the Philistines , to cut off from Tyre and Sidon any Philistine who might have escaped to get help . Jehovah will destroy the Philistines and anyone who is left from the island of Crete .
» Gaza will shave its head in mourning . Ashkelon will be destroyed . How long will you cut yourselves , you people left on the plains ?
» You cry out : Sword of Jehovah , how long will you keep on fighting ? Go back into your sheath . Stay there and rest !
» How can the sword of Jehovah rest ? Jehovah has ordered it to attack Ashkelon and the coast . He has assigned it to be there . «
This is what the Lord Jehovah said about MOAB : » Pity the people of Nebo . Their town is destroyed ! Kiriathaim is captured , its mighty fortress torn down , and its people put to shame .
» The splendor of Moab is gone . The enemy has captured Heshbon and plot to destroy the nation of Moab . The town of Madmen will be silenced . Armies will march against it .
» The people of Horonaim cry out : » Violence ! Destruction ! «
Moab has been destroyed ! Listen to the children crying .
Hear the sound of their sobs along the road up to Luhith , the cries of distress on the way down to Horonaim .
» Quick , run for your lives ! « They say . » Run like a wild desert donkey ! «
Moab , you trusted in your strength and your wealth , but now even you will be conquered . Your god Chemosh will go into exile , along with his princes and priests .
Not a town will escape the destruction . Both valley and plain will be ruined . I Jehovah have spoken .
» Set up a tombstone for Moab . It will soon be destroyed . Its towns will be left in ruins , and no one will live there again .
» Curse those who do not do Jehovah’s work with all their heart ! Curse those who do not slash and kill !
Jehovah said : » Moab has always lived secure and has never been taken into exile . Moab is like wine left to settle undisturbed and never poured from jar to jar . Its flavor has never been ruined , and it tastes as good as ever .
» ‘ So now , the time is coming when I will send people to pour Moab out like wine . They will empty its wine jars and break them in pieces .
» Then the Moabites will be disillusioned with their god Chemosh . The same as the Israelites were disillusioned with Bethel , their trusted god .
» ‘ Men of Moab , why do you claim to be heroes , brave soldiers tested in war ? ’ «
» ‘ Moab and its cities are destroyed . Its finest young men have been slaughtered . ‘ I am the king , the Lord Jehovah , and I have spoken !
» Moab's doom approaches . Its ruin is coming soon .
» Mourn for that nation , you that live nearby , all of you that know its fame . Say : ‘ Its powerful rule has been broken . Its glory and might are no more . ’
» You that live in Dibon come down from your place of honor and sit on the ground in the dust . Moab's destroyer is here and has left its forts in ruins .
» You that live in Aroer stand by the road and wait . Ask those who are running away , say , ‘ What has happened ? ’
» Moab has fallen , they will answer ; weep for it because it is disgraced . Announce along the Arnon River that Moab is destroyed !
» Judgment has come on the cities of the plateau : on Holon , Jahzah , Mephaath ,
» Dibon , Nebo , Beth Diblathaim ,
» Kiriathaim , Bethgamul , Bethmeon ,
» Kerioth , and Bozrah . Judgment has come on all the cities of Moab , far and near .
» ‘ Moab's might has been crushed . Its power has been destroyed . I Jehovah have spoken .
» ‘ Jehovah said : ‘ Make Moab drunk , because it has rebelled against me . Moab will roll in its own vomit and people will laugh .
» ‘ Moab , remember how you made fun of the people of Israel ? You treated them as though they had been caught with a gang of robbers .
» ‘ You people who live in Moab , leave your towns ! Go and live on the cliffs ! Be like the dove that makes its nest in the sides of a ravine . ’ «
» Moab is very proud ! I have heard how proud , arrogant , and conceited the people are , how much they think of themselves . «
» ‘ Jehovah says : ‘ I know Moab’s great pride , but it is of no use . Moab’s bragging gains nothing .
» ‘ I cry with sadness for Moab , yes for everyone in Moab . I moan for the people from the town of Kir-Hareseth .
» ‘ I weep with the people of the town of Jazer . And what of the grapevines of the town of Sibmah ? In the past your vines spread all the way to the sea , as far as the sea of Jazer . But the destroyer has taken over your fruit and grapes .
« ‘ Joy and gladness are taken from the fruitful orchards and fields and from the land of Moab . I have stopped the flow of wine from the wine presses . No one walks on the grapes with shouts of joy . There are shouts , but they are not shouts of joy .
» ‘ Their crying can be heard from Moabite towns . It can be heard from Heshbon to Elealeh and Jahaz , from Zoar as far away as Horonaim and Eglath Shelishiyah three year old heifer . Even the waters of Nimrim are dried up .
» ‘ I will stop Moab from making burnt offerings at the places of worship . I will stop Moab from burning incense to their gods , says Jehovah .
» ‘ My heart cries sadly for Moab like a flute playing a funeral song . It cries like a flute for the people from Kir Hareseth . The money they made has all been taken away .
» ‘ They have all shaved their heads and cut off their beards . They have all made gashes on their hands , and everyone is wearing sackcloth . ’ «
» ‘ People are weeping on every roof in Moab and in every public square . There is only sadness , because I have broken Moab like a jar no one wants , ’ ’ say Jehovah .
‘ Moab has been shattered ! Cry out ! Moab has been disgraced . It is in ruins and all the surrounding nations make fun of it . ’ ’ I Jehovah have spoken .
» This is what Jehovah says : ‘ Look ! Someone is coming like an eagle diving down from the sky and spreading its wings over Moab .
» The towns of Moab will be captured . The strong walled cities will be defeated . Then Moab’s warriors will be frightened like a woman who is giving birth . ’ «
» ‘ The nation of Moab will be destroyed . This is because they thought they were greater than Jehovah .
» ‘ Fear , deep pits , and traps wait for you people of Moab , ’ ’ says Jehovah .
» ‘ People will run out of fear , but they will fall into the pits . Those who climb out of the pits will be caught in the traps . ’ ’ » I will bring the year of punishment to Moab , « says Jehovah .
‘ Helpless people have run to find protection in Heshbon , the city that King Sihon once ruled , but it is in flames . It has burned up leaders of Moab and destroyed those proud people . ’
» ‘ Pity the people of Moab ! The people who worshiped Chemosh have been destroyed . Their sons and daughters have been taken away as prisoners .
» ‘ In the future , however , I will make good things happen to Moab . It will be prosperous again , ’ ’ says Jehovah . As of now the judgement of Moab . ’ «
This is what Jehovah says about the people of AMMON : » Does Israel not have any children ? Does it not have any heirs ? Why has the god Milcom taken over the inheritance of Gad's descendants ? Why do Milcom's people live in Gad's cities ? «
» ‘ That is why the days are coming , ’ ’ declares Jehovah , ‘ when I will sound the battle cry against Rabbah , where the people of Ammon live . It will become a pile of rubble . Its villages will be burned down . ’ ’ » ‘ Then Israel will take possession of its inheritance , ’ ’ says Jehovah .
» ‘ Cry loudly , Heshbon , because Ai is destroyed . Cry , people of Rabbah , put on your sackcloth , and mourn . Run back and forth between the walls . Milcom will be taken away into captivity with its priests and officials .
Why do you brag about your valleys , your fertile valleys , you unfaithful people ? You trust your treasures . You think : » Who would attack me ? «
» I will bring terror on you from all around , « proclaims Jehovah of Hosts . » Everyone will be scattered . No one will gather the refugees . ’ «
» ‘ Afterward , I will return the captives of Ammon , ’ ’ declares Jehovah . «
This is what Jehovah of Hosts says about Edom : » Is there no longer any wisdom in Teman ? Has wisdom disappeared from your people ? Has their wisdom vanished ?
» Turn and run , take cover in deep places inhabitants of Dedan . When I punish them , I will bring disaster on the descendants of Esau .
» If people come to pick your grapes , will they not leave a few grapes behind ? If thieves come during the night , will they steal only until they have had enough ?
» Yet , I will strip the descendants of Esau . I will find their hiding places . They will not be able to hide . Their children and relatives will be destroyed . None of their neighbors will say :
» Abandon your orphans , and I will keep them alive . Your widows can trust me . «
This is what Jehovah says : » If those who do not deserve to drink from the cup still drink from it , why should you go unpunished ? You will not go unpunished . You must drink from it . «
» I take an oath on myself , « says Jehovah , » that Bozrah will become a pile of rubble . It will become something horrifying , ridiculed , ruined , and cursed . All its cities will lie in ruins permanently . «
I heard a message from Jehovah . A messenger was sent among the nations to say : » Assemble and attack Edom . Get ready for battle . «
» Edom , I will make you the smallest of nations and despised among humanity .
» You have frightened other people . Your arrogance has deceived you . You live on rocky cliffs and occupy the highest places in the hills . Even though you build your nest as high as an eagle , I will bring you down from there , « proclaims Jehovah .
Jehovah said : » The destruction that will come on Edom will be so terrible that everyone who passes by will be shocked and terrified .
» The same thing will happen to Edom that happened to Sodom and Gomorrah , when they and the nearby towns were destroyed . No one will ever live there again . I Jehovah have spoken .
» Like a lion coming out of the thick woods along the Jordan River up to the green pastureland , I will come and make the Edomites run away suddenly from their country . Then the leader I choose will rule the nation . Who can be compared to me ? Who would dare challenge me ? What ruler could oppose me ? «
Hear that which I have determined against the people of Edom , and to what I intend to do to the people of the city of Teman . Even their children will be dragged off , and everyone will be horrified .
When Edom falls , there will be such a noise that the entire earth will shake . The cries of alarm will be heard as far away as the Gulf of Aqaba .
The enemy will attack Bozrah like an eagle swooping down with outspread wings . On that day Edom's soldiers will be as frightened as a woman in labor .
This is what Jehovah said about Damascus : The people in the cities of Hamath and Arpad are worried and troubled because they have heard bad news . Anxiety rolls over them like a sea , and they cannot rest .
» The people of Damascus are weak and have fled in terror . They are in pain and misery like a woman in labor .
» I once was pleased with your famous city . But now I warn you : Escape while you still can !
» Soon , even your best soldiers will lie dead in your streets . I the all-powerful Jehovah have spoken .
» I will set fire to your city walls and burn down the fortresses King Benhadad built . «
This is what Jehovah says about the Kedar tribe and the desert villages that were conquered by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia : » Listen , you people of Kedar and the other tribes of the eastern desert . I have told Nebuchadnezzar to attack and destroy you .
» His fearsome army will surround you . They will take your tents and possessions , your sheep and camels .
» Run and hide , you people of the desert who live in villages ! Nebuchadnezzar has big plans for you .
» You have no city walls and no neighbors to help . You think you are safe . Therefore I told him to attack .
» Your camels and large herds will be yours no longer . People of the Arabian Desert , disaster will strike you from every side , and you will be scattered everywhere on earth .
» Hazor will be a place where only jackals live . It will become a permanent wasteland . No one will live there . No human will stay there . «
Early in the rule of King Zedekiah of Judah , Jehovah spoke his word to the prophet Jeremiah about Elam .
» This is what Jehovah of Hosts says : ‘ I am going to break the bows of Elam's archers , the most important weapon of their strength .
» ‘ I will bring the four winds from the four corners of heaven against Elam and scatter its people in every direction . There will not be a nation where Elam's refugees will not go .
» ‘ I will defeat the people of Elam in the presence of their enemies , in the presence of those who want to kill them . I will bring disaster with my burning anger , ’ ’ declares Jehovah . ‘ I will send armies after them until I put an end to them .
» ‘ I will set my throne in Elam and destroy its king and officials , ’ declares Jehovah .
» ‘ Afterward , I will return the captives of Elam , ’ « declares Jehovah .
The word Jehovah spoke concerning BABYLON , the land of the Chaldeans , through Jeremiah the prophet :
» Declare and proclaim among the nations . Proclaim it and lift up a standard . Do not conceal it but say : ‘ Babylon has been captured . Bel has been put to shame . Marduk has been shattered ! Her images have been put to shame and her idols have been shattered . ’
» A nation has come up against her out of the north . It will make her land an object of horror . There will be no inhabitant in it . Both man and beast wander off . They have gone away !
» In those days and at that time , « declares Jehovah , » the sons of Israel will come . Both they and the sons of Judah will go along weeping as they go . They will seek Jehovah their God .
» They will ask for the way to Zion turning their faces in its direction . They will come to join themselves to Jehovah in an everlasting covenant that will not be forgotten .
» My people have become lost sheep . Their shepherds have led them astray . They have made them turn aside on the mountains . They have gone along from mountain to hill and have forgotten their resting place .
» All who came upon them have devoured them . Their adversaries said : ‘ We are not guilty . They have sinned against Jehovah who is the habitation of righteousness , Even Jehovah , the hope of their fathers . ’
» Wander away from the midst of Babylon . Go forth from the land of the Chaldeans . Be also like male goats at the head of the flock .
» I am going to stir up an alliance of strong nations from the north and bring it against Babylon . Those nations will take up positions against Babylon . Babylon will be captured from the north . Its enemy's arrows will be like skilled soldiers who don't come back empty-handed .
» The Babylonians will become the prize . All who loot them will get everything they want , « declares Jehovah .
» You are happy and excited . You have looted the people who belong to me . You dance around like calves on the grass and neigh like stallions .
» But your mother will be greatly ashamed . The woman who gave birth to you will be disgraced . Babylon , you will be the least important nation . You will become a parched desert .
» No one will live in Babylon because of Jehovah’s anger . It will be completely abandoned . Everyone who passes by Babylon will be horrified and hiss at all its wounds .
» Take up your positions around Babylon , all you archers with bows . Shoot at it and do not save any arrows . For the people of Babylon have sinned against Jehovah .
» Shout a war cry against them on every side . They will surrender . Their towers will fall and their walls will be torn down . Since this is Jehovah’s vengeance , take revenge against them . Do to them what they did to others .
» Do not allow anyone in Babylon to plant or harvest . Everyone will turn to his own people and flee to his own homeland because of the enemies' swords .
» The people of Israel are like scattered sheep that lions have chased . The first to devour them was the king of Assyria . The last to gnaw at their bones was King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon .
» This is what Jehovah of Hosts , the God of Israel , says : ‘ I am going to punish the king of Babylon and his land as I punished the king of Assyria .
» ‘ I will bring the people of Israel back to their pastures . They will eat on Mount Carmel and Mount Bashan . They will eat until they are full on the mountains of Ephraim and Gilead .
» ‘ In those days and at that time , « says Jehovah , » people will look for Israel's crimes , but they will find none . They will look for Judah's sins , but none will be found . I will forgive the faithful few whom I have spared .
» Attack the land of Merathaim and the people who live in Pekod . Claim them for me by killing them with a sword , says Jehovah . Do everything I commanded you .
» The noise of battle and great destruction fills the land .
» The hammer of the whole earth is broken and shattered . See how desolate Babylon is of all the nations !
» I will set traps for you , Babylon . You will be caught , but you will not know it . You will be found and captured because you have opposed Jehovah . «
Jehovah will open his armory and bring out the weapons of his fury , because Jehovah of Hosts has a job to do in the land of the Babylonians .
Attack them from a distance , open their storehouses , pile up their corpses like piles of grain , claim them for me by destroying them , and do not leave anyone behind .
Kill all their young bulls . Let them go to be slaughtered . How horrible it will be for them when their time has come , the time for them to be punished .
Fugitives and refugees from Babylon are coming to Zion to tell about the vengeance of Jehovah our God , the vengeance for his temple .
» Call together the archers , the soldiers with bows , against Babylon . Set up blockades around it . Do not let anyone escape . Pay the people of Babylon back for what they have done . Do to them what they did to others . They have disobeyed Jehovah , the Holy One of Israel .
» That is why their young men will die in the streets , and all their soldiers will be silenced that day , declares Jehovah .
» I am against you , you arrogant city , declares the Lord Jehovah of Hosts . » Your day has come , the time when I will punish you .
» Those prideful people will stumble and fall , and there will be no one to help them get up . I will light a fire in their cities that will burn up everything around them . «
Jehovah of Hosts says : » All the people of Israel and Judah are oppressed . All their enemies have captured them . They refuse to let them go .
» Their defender is strong . His name is Jehovah of Hosts . He will certainly take up their cause in order to bring rest to the land of Israel and unrest to the people who live in Babylon .
» A sword will kill the Babylonians and everyone who lives in Babylon , « declares Jehovah . » A sword will kill their officials and their wise men .
» A sword will kill the false prophets . They will become fools . A sword will kill their soldiers and defeat them .
» A sword will kill their horses , their chariots , and all the foreigners within their ranks . They will become women . A sword will destroy their treasures , and they will be looted .
» A drought will diminish their water supply , and it will dry up . Babylon is a land of idols , statues that will go crazy with fear .
» That is why desert animals will live with hyenas . Desert owls will also live there . It will no longer be inhabited or lived in for generations .
» Babylon will be like Sodom and Gomorrah , and their neighboring cities when I , God , destroyed them . No one will live there . No human will stay there , proclaims Jehovah .
» People are going to come from the north . A great nation and many kings will rise from the ends of the earth .
» They will take hold of bows and spears . They will be cruel and have no compassion . They will sound like the sea when it roars . They will ride horses . They are ready for war , ready to attack you , people of Babylon .
» The king of Babylon has heard reports about them , and he loses courage . Anguish will grip him as pain grips a woman in labor .
» I will suddenly chase them from their places like a lion coming out of the jungle along the Jordan River into pastureland . I will appoint over Babylon whomever I choose . Who is like me ? Who can challenge me ? Is there any leader who can stand up to me ? «
Listen to what Jehovah is going to do against Babylon and the things he intends to do to the land of the Babylonians . He will surely drag away the little ones of the flock . He will surely destroy the pasture because of the Babylonians .
The earth will quake at the news , » Babylon has been captured ! « Its cry will be heard among the nations .
Jehovah says : » I am bringing a destructive wind against Babylon and its people .
» I will send foreigners to destroy Babylon like a wind that blows straw away . When that day of destruction comes , they will attack from every side and leave the land bare .
» Do not give its soldiers time to shoot their arrows or to put on their armor . Do not spare the young men ! Destroy the whole army !
» They will be wounded and die in the streets of their cities .
I , the Lord Jehovah , have not abandoned Israel and Judah , even though they have sinned against me , the Holy One of Israel .
» Run away from Babylon ! Run for your lives ! Do not be killed because of Babylon's sin . I am now taking my revenge . I am punishing it as it deserves .
» Babylon was like a gold cup in my hand , making the whole world drunk . The nations drank its wine and went out of their minds .
» Babylon has suddenly fallen and is destroyed ! Mourn over it ! Get medicine for its wounds , and maybe it can be healed . «
» Foreigners living there said : ‘ We tried to help Babylon , but it was too late . Let us leave now and go back home . God has punished Babylon with all his might and has destroyed it completely . ’ «
Jehovah says : » My people shout , Jehovah has shown that we are in the right . Let us go and tell the people in Jerusalem what Jehovah our God has done . «
» Jehovah has stirred up the kings of Media , because he intends to destroy Babylon . That is how he will take revenge for the destruction of his Temple . The attacking officers command : Sharpen your arrows ! Get your shields ready !
» Give the signal to attack Babylon's walls . Strengthen the guard ! Post the sentries ! Place troops in ambush ! Jehovah has done what he said he would do to the people of Babylon . «
» That country has many rivers and rich treasures . Yet its time is up , and its thread of life is cut .
Jehovah has sworn by his own life : » I will bring many men to attack Babylon like a swarm of locusts , and they will shout with victory . «
Jehovah made the earth by his power . By his wisdom he created the world and stretched out the heavens .
When He utters His voice , there is a tumult of waters in the heavens . He causes the clouds to ascend from the end of the earth . He makes lightning for the rain and brings forth the wind from his storehouses .
All mankind is stupid and devoid of knowledge . Every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols . His molten images are deceitful , and there is no breath in them .
They are worthless , a work of mockery . In the time of their punishment they will perish .
The portion of Jacob is not like these . He is the maker of all and of the tribe of his inheritance . Jehovah of Hosts is his name .
He says : » You are my war-club , my weapon of war . I shatter nations with you and with you I destroy kingdoms .
» I will use you to crush horses and their riders . I will use you to crush chariots and their drivers .
» I will use you to crush men and women . I will use you to crush the old and the young . I will use you to crush young men and women .
» I will use you to crush shepherds and their flocks . I will use you to crush farmers and their oxen . I will use you to crush governors and officials .
» In your presence I will pay back Babylon and all the people who live in Babylon for all the evil things that they did in Zion , « proclaims Jehovah .
» I am against you , Babylon , you destructive mountain . You have destroyed the whole earth , « declares Jehovah . » I will use my power against you and roll you off the cliffs , and make you a scorched mountain .
» People will not find any stones in you to use as a cornerstone . They will not find any stones in you to use for a foundation . You will become permanent ruins , « declares Jehovah .
Raise your battle flag throughout the world . Blow the ram's horn among the nations . Prepare nations to attack Babylon . Tell the kingdoms of Ararat , Minni , and Ashkenaz to attack it . Appoint a commander to lead the attack . Bring up horses like a swarm of locusts .
Prepare nations to attack Babylon . Prepare the king of the Medes , their governors , all their deputies , and all the countries that they rule .
The earth trembles and writhes in pain . Jehovah carries out his plans against Babylon to make Babylon a wasteland so that no one will live there .
The warriors of Babylon have stopped fighting . They stay in their fortified cities . Their strength has failed . They have become women . Their buildings are set on fire . The bars across their gates are broken .
Runners run to meet runners . Messengers follow messengers . They inform the king of Babylon that his entire city is captured .
The river crossings have been taken . The enemy has burned its marshes , and its soldiers are terrified .
» I am the All-Powerful Jehovah , the God of Israel , and I make this promise : Soon Babylon will be leveled and packed down like a threshing place at harvest time .
» The people of Jerusalem say : King Nebuchadnezzar made us panic . That monster big snake filled up with our treasures , leaving us empty . He gobbled down what he wanted and spit out the rest .
» The people of Babylon harmed some of us and killed others . Now Jehovah will make them pay .
Therefore Jehovah says : » I am going to plead your case and exact full vengeance for you . I will dry up her sea and make her fountain dry .
» Babylon will become a heap of ruins , a haunt of jackals , an object of horror and hissing , without inhabitants .
» They will roar together like young lions . They will growl like lions' cubs .
» When they become heated up , I will serve them their banquet and make them drunk , that they may become jubilant . Then they may sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake up , declares Jehovah .
» I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter , like rams together with male goats .
» How Sheshak has been captured , and the praise of the whole earth been seized ! How Babylon has become an object of horror among the nations !
» The sea has come up over Babylon . She has been engulfed with its tumultuous waves .
» Her cities have become an object of horror , a parched land and a desert , a land in which no man lives and through which no son of man passes .
» I will punish Bel in Babylon . I will make Bel spit out everything that it has swallowed . Nations will no longer stream to Babylon . Its walls will fall .
» Get out of her , my people ! Run for your lives ! Run from the burning anger of Jehovah .
» Do not lose courage or be afraid when rumors are heard in the land . One rumor comes one year ; another rumor comes the next year . Rumors of violence are in the land . Rumors that one ruler will fight against another are in the land .
That is why the days are coming when I will punish Babylon's idols . The whole country will be put to shame , and all its soldiers will lie dead .
» Then heaven and earth and everything in them will rejoice over Babylon . Destroyers from the north will attack it , « declares Jehovah .
Because the people of Babylon have killed many Israelites and because they have killed many people throughout the earth , Babylon must fall .
You people escaped from the sword . Now leave ! Do not just stand there . Remember Jehovah in a distant land and think about Jerusalem .
We have been put to shame . We have been disgraced . Shame covers our faces , because foreigners have gone into the holy places of Jehovah’s temple .
» That is why the days are coming , « declares Jehovah , » when I will punish their idols , and those who are wounded will moan everywhere in the land .
» The people of Babylon might go up to heaven . They might fortify their strongholds . But destroyers will still come from me against them , « declares Jehovah .
Cries of agony are heard from Babylon . Sounds of terrible destruction are heard from the land of the Babylonians .
Jehovah will destroy Babylon . He will silence the loud noise coming from it . Waves of enemies will come roaring in like raging water . The noise will be heard everywhere .
A destroyer will attack Babylon , its soldiers will be captured , and their bows and arrows will be broken . I Jehovah am a God who punishes evil . I will certainly punish them .
» I will make their officials and wise men drunk , along with their governors , officers , and soldiers . They will fall into a deep sleep and never wake up , « proclaims the king , whose name is Jehovah of Hosts .
This is what Jehovah of Hosts says : The thick walls of Babylon will be leveled , and its high gates will be set on fire . People exhaust themselves for nothing . The nations wear themselves out only to have a fire .
This is the message that the prophet Jeremiah gave to Seraiah , son of Neriah and grandson of Mahseiah , when Seraiah went to Babylon with King Zedekiah of Judah in the fourth year of Zedekiah's rule . Seraiah was the quartermaster .
Jeremiah wrote on a scroll all the disasters that would happen to Babylon . He wrote all these things that have been written about Babylon .
Jeremiah said to Seraiah : » When you come to Babylon , see that you read all this .
Then says : ‘ Jehovah , you have threatened to destroy this place so that no person or animal will live here . It will become a permanent ruin . ’
» When you finish reading this scroll , tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates River .
» Say : ‘ Babylon will sink like this scroll . It will never rise again because of the disasters that I will bring on it . ’ « The words of Jeremiah end here .
Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to rule . He ruled for eleven years in Jerusalem . His mother's name was Hamutal , daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah .
Zedekiah did what Jehovah considered evil , as Jehoiakim had done .
Jehovah became angry at Jerusalem and Judah and threw the people out of his sight . Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
On the tenth day of the tenth month of the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign , King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon attacked Jerusalem with his entire army . They set up camp and built dirt ramps around the city walls .
The blockade of the city lasted until Zedekiah's eleventh year as king .
On the ninth day of the fourth month , the famine in the city became so severe that the common people had no food .
The enemy broke through the city walls , and all Judah's soldiers fled . They left the city at night through the gate between the two walls beside the king's garden . While the Babylonians were attacking the city from all sides , they took the road to the plain of Jericho .
The Babylonian army pursued King Zedekiah and caught up with him in the plain of Jericho . His entire army had deserted him .
The Babylonians captured the king and brought him to the king of Babylon at Riblah in Hamath . The king of Babylon passed sentence on him there .
The king of Babylon slaughtered Zedekiah's sons as Zedekiah watched . He also slaughtered all the officials of Judah at Riblah .
Then he blinded Zedekiah and put him in bronze shackles . The king of Babylon took him to Babylon and put him in a prison , where he stayed until he died .
On the tenth day of the fifth month of Nebuchadnezzar's nineteenth year as king of Babylon , Nebuzaradan , who was the captain of the guard and an officer of the king of Babylon , came to Jerusalem .
He burned down Jehovah’s Temple , the royal palace , and all the houses in Jerusalem . Every important building was burned down .
The entire Babylonian army that was with the captain of the guard tore down the walls around Jerusalem .
Nebuzaradan , the captain of the guard , captured the few people left in the city , those who surrendered to the king of Babylon , and the rest of the population .
Nebuzaradan , the captain of the guard , left some of the poorest people in the land to work in the vineyards and on the farms .
The Babylonians broke apart the copper pillars of Jehovah’s Temple , the stands , and the copper pool in Jehovah’s Temple . They shipped all the copper to Babylon .
they took the pots , shovels , snuffers , bowls , dishes , and all the copper utensils used in the Temple service .
The captain of the guard also took pans , incense burners , bowls , pots , lamp stands , dishes , and the bowls used for wine offerings . The captain of the guard took all of the trays and bowls that were made of gold or silver .
The copper from the two pillars , the pool , and the twelve copper bulls under the stands that King Solomon had made for Jehovah’s Temple could not be weighed .
One pillar was twenty-seven feet high and eighteen feet in circumference . It was three inches thick and hollow .
The crown that was on it was seven and one half feet high with filigree and pomegranates around it . They were all made of copper . The second pillar was the same . It also had pomegranates .
There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides . The total number of pomegranates on the surrounding filigree was one hundred .
The captain of the guard took the chief priest Seraiah , the second priest Zephaniah , and the three doorkeepers .
From the city he also took an army commander , seven men who had access to the king whom he found in the city , the scribe who was in charge of the militia , and sixty common people whom he found in the city .
Nebuzaradan , the captain of the guard , brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah .
The king of Babylon executed them at Riblah in the territory of Hamath . So the people of Judah were captives as they left their land .
These are the people whom Nebuchadnezzar took captive : In his seventh year as king , he took three thousand and twenty-three Jews .
In his eighteenth year , Nebuchadnezzar took eight hundred and thirty-two people from Jerusalem .
In Nebuchadnezzar's twenty-third year as king , Nebuzaradan , the captain of the guard , took away seven hundred and forty-five Jews . In all , four thousand six hundred people were taken away .
On the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month of the thirty-seventh year of the imprisonment of King Jehoiakin of Judah , King Evil Merodach of Babylon , in the first year of his reign , freed King Jehoiakin of Judah and released him from prison .
He treated him well and gave him a special position higher than the other kings who were with him in Babylon .
Jehoiakin no longer wore prison clothes , and he ate his meals in the king's presence as long as he lived .
The king of Babylon gave him a daily food allowance as long as he lived .
She sits alone . She was a town full of people ! Once great among the nations she has become like a widow ! She who was a princess among the countries has come under the yoke of forced labor !
She weeps bitterly in the night . Her cheeks are wet from crying . Her lovers offer no comfort . Her friends have been false to her . They have become her enemies .
Judah has been taken away as a prisoner because of trouble and hard work . She dwells among the nations . There is no rest for her . Her attackers have overtaken her in the midst of her distress .
The roads to Zion are sad . No one comes to the holy meeting . All her doorways are desolate . Her priests are sighing out of sorrow . Her virgins are troubled , and it is bitter for her .
Her enemies are at ease and her foes have become her masters . Jehovah sends her sorrow because of the great number of her sins . Young children have gone away as prisoners before the attacker .
Glory has gone from the daughter of Zion ! Her rulers are like stags with no place to eat . They flee without strength from their attacker .
Jerusalem remembers in her days of sorrow and of her wanderings , all the desired things that were hers in the past . When her people were captive to the power of her adversary she had no helper . Her attackers desired her and made fun of her in her destruction .
Great is the sin of Jerusalem ! For this cause she has become an unclean thing . Those who gave her honor are looking down on her . They see her shame . Now truly , sighing out grief , she turns back .
In her skirts were her unclean ways . She did not think of the future . Her fall has been a wonder . She has no comforter : » See her sorrow , O Jehovah , for the enemy is lifted up . «
The hand of her enemies is stretched out over all her desired things . She sees the nations come into her holy place . Whom you gave orders that they were not to come into the meeting of your people .
Her people are sighing and looking for bread . They have given their desired things for something to eat to give them life . » See , O Jehovah , and take note . She has become a thing of shame . «
» Come to me all you who go by , keep your eyes on me ! See if there is any pain like the pain of my wound . For Jehovah has sent it to me in the day of his burning anger .
» He sends fire into my bones from on high . It overcomes them . His net is stretched out for my feet . He turns me back . He made me waste and feeble all the day .
» He keeps watch on my sins . They are joined together by his hand , they have come on to my neck ; he makes my strength give way . Jehovah gives me into the hands of those against whom I have no power .
» Jehovah makes fun of my men of war . He gathers men against me to send destruction on my young men . The virgin daughter of Judah has been crushed like grapes under the feet of Jehovah .
» For these things I weep . My eye streams with water because the comforter who might give me new life is far from me . My children are desolate because the enemy is strong . «
Zion’s hands are outstretched . She has no comforter . Jehovah gave orders to the attackers of Jacob round about him : Jerusalem is an unclean abhorrent thing among them .
» Jehovah is upright . I have rebelled against him . Listen all you people and see my pain . My virgins and my young men are taken away as prisoners .
» I sent for my lovers , but they were false to me . My priests and my responsible men are dying . They look for food to give them new life .
» See , O Jehovah , I am in trouble . The inmost parts of my body are deeply moved . My heart is turned in me for I have been rebellious . Outside the children are put to the sword , and in the house there is death .
Listen to the voice of my grief . I have no comforter . All my enemies have news of my troubles . They are glad because you did it . Let the day come when they will be like me .
» Let all their badness come before you . Do to them as you have done to me for all my sins : for loud is the sound of my grief , and the strength of my heart is gone . «
In his anger Jehovah covered Zion with clouds of darkness . He changed its heavenly splendor into ruins . On the day of his anger he abandoned even his footstool .
Without mercy Jehovah destroyed every village in Judah . He tore down the forts that defended the land . He brought disgrace on the kingdom and its rulers .
In his burning anger he cut down every horn strength power of Israel . He turned his right hand back from before the enemy . He has put a fire in Jacob devouring and destroying all around .
He bends his bow for the attack . He takes his place with his hand ready . In his hate he puts to death all those pleasing to the eye in the tent of the daughter of Zion . He poured out his rage just like fire .
Jehovah has become like an enemy fighting against her , sending destruction on Israel . He has sent destruction on all her great houses , turning his strong places into waste . He increases the grief and the sorrow of the daughter of Judah .
He violently takes away his tent , as from a garden . And he lays waste his meeting-place . Jehovah has taken away the memory of feast and Sabbath in Zion . In the passion of his wrath he is against king and priest .
Jehovah rejected his altar and disowned his holy place . He gave up into the hands of the attacker the walls of her great houses . Their voices have been loud in the house of Jehovah as in the day of a holy meeting .
It is Jehovah’s purpose to turn the wall of the daughter of Zion into waste . His line has been stretched out . He has not kept back his hand from destruction . He has sent sorrow on tower and wall . They have become feeble together .
Her gates have gone down into the earth . He destroyed her locks and bars . Her king and her princes are among the nations where there is no law . Her prophets have had no vision from Jehovah .
The elders of the daughter of Zion are seated on the earth and keep silent . They throw dust on their heads . They are clothed in sackcloth . The heads of the virgins of Jerusalem are brought down to the earth .
My eyes fail from weeping . I am in torment . My heart is pulled out of me to the ground because my people are destroyed . Because of the young children and babies at the breast who are falling without strength in the open squares of the town .
They say to their mothers : » Where is grain and wine ? « When they are falling like the wounded in the open squares of the town . Their life is drained out while on their mother’s breast .
What example am I to give you ? What comparison am I to make for you , O daughter of Jerusalem ? What am I to make equal to you , so that I may give you comfort , O virgin daughter of Zion ? Your destruction is great like the sea . Who is able to make you well ?
The visions your prophets have seen for you are false and foolish ! They have not made you fully aware of your sin so your fate might be changed . They have seen for you false words , driving you away .
All who go by make a noise with their hands at you . They make hisses , shaking their heads at the daughter of Jerusalem . They say : » Is this the town that was the crown of everything beautiful , the joy of all the earth ? «
All your enemies are opening their mouths wide against you . They hiss and whistle through their teeth and say : » We have made a meal of her . Certainly this is the day we have been looking for . It has come and we see it . «
Jehovah accomplished his purpose . He accomplished what he said he would with the orders he gave in the days that are past . He tore down and shows no compassion . He causes your enemies to rejoice . He lifted up the horn power of your adversaries .
Let your cry go up to Jehovah : » O wall of the daughter of Zion let your weeping be flowing down like a stream day and night . Give yourself no rest . Do not let your eyes hold back the drops of sorrow .
» Rise up ! Cry out in the night at the beginning of the night watches . Let your heart be flowing out like water before the face of Jehovah . Lift up your hands to him for the life of your young children who are falling down starving in every street . «
Look , O Jehovah ! Why are you punishing us like this ? Women are eating the bodies of the children they loved ! Priests and prophets are killed in the Temple !
Both young and old lie dead in the streets . Enemy swords kill young men and women . You slaughtered them without mercy on the day of your anger .
You invited my enemies to hold a festival of terror all around me . No one could escape on that day of your anger . They murdered my children , whom I had raised and loved .
I am the man who has seen trouble by the rod of his fury .
By him I have been made to go in the dark and not in the light .
Truly against me his hand has been turned again and again all day long .
My flesh and my skin have been used up by him and my bones broken .
He built a wall against me , shutting me in with hardship and bitter sorrow .
He kept me in dark places , like those who have been dead a long time .
He built a wall around me so that I am unable to go out . He made a heavy chain for me .
Even when I send up a cry for help , he shuts out my prayer .
He blocked my way with cut stones . He twisted my roadways .
He is like a bear waiting for me , like a lion in secret places .
He has turned me on one side . I have been pulled to bits and lay desolate .
With his bow bent , he made me the target for his arrows .
He has let fly his arrows into the inmost parts of my body .
I have become the laughingstock of all the peoples . I am their mocking song all the day .
He has made my life nothing but pain . He gives me bitterness in full measure .
He broke my teeth with crushed stones . I am bent low in the dust .
Peace has been removed far away from me . I do not remember what good is .
I said : » My strength is cut off , and my hope from Jehovah . «
Remember my trouble and my wandering , the bitterroot and the poison .
Remember and bow bend come down to my level down deep within me .
I remember this and I have hope .
We have not come to destruction because of Jehovah’s loving kindness . His mercies are without end .
They are new every morning . Your faithfulness is abundant .
I said to myself , » Jehovah is my heritage . For this reason I will hope in him . «
Jehovah is good to those who are waiting for him , to the person seeking him .
It is good to go on hoping and quietly waiting for the salvation of Jehovah .
It is good for a man to carry the yoke when he is young .
Let him sit by himself and keep silent because he has laid it on him .
Let him put his mouth in the dust for perhaps there exists hope .
Let his face be turned to him who gives him blows ; let him be full of shame .
Jehovah does not give a man up for a very long time .
For though he sends grief , still he will have pity in the full measure of his love .
He takes no pleasure in troubling and causing grief to the children of men , it is not within his heart .
A man crushes under his feet all the prisoners of the earth .
He turns away the judgment of a man before the face of the Most High .
Jehovah would not seek to deprive a man of justice .
Who is able to say something should occur if Jehovah has not ordered it .
Do not calamities and good things come from the mouth of the Most High ?
What protest may a living man make ? Can a man protest about the punishment for his sin ?
Let us search and put our ways to the test . Let us turn again to Jehovah .
Let us lift up our hearts along with our hands to God in heaven .
For we have done wrong . We have rebelled against your law . We have not received your forgiveness .
You blocked our approach to you with anger . You have slain us without compassion .
You covered yourself with a cloud , so that prayer may not pass through .
You made us like waste and that for which there is no use , among the peoples .
The mouths of all our enemies are open wide against us .
Fear and deep waters have come on us with devastation and destruction .
Rivers of water run down from my eyes because pf the destruction of the daughter of my people .
My eyes stream without stopping . They have no rest .
Jehovah looks down and sees from heaven .
My eyes bring me pain because of all the daughters of my town .
My enemies hunt for me just as if I was a bird .
They sentence my life to prison and keep hurling stones at me .
Waters were flowing over my head ; I said : » I am cut off . «
I called out your name in prayer , O Jehovah , out of the lowest prison .
My voice came to you , » Do not shut your ear to my relief , to my cry ! «
You came near in the day when I offered my prayer to you . You said : » Have no fear . «
O Jehovah , you have taken up my cause . You made my life safe .
O Jehovah , you saw the wrong done to me . Do conduct the judgment for me !
You saw all the evil they did to me and all their designs against me .
Their bitter words have come to your ears , O Jehovah , and all their designs against me .
You saw the lips of those who came up against me , and their thoughts against me all the day .
Take note of them when they are seated and when they get up . I am their mockery of song .
You will give them their reward , O Jehovah . Answer the work of their hands .
You will cover their hearts with your curse on them .
You will go after them in anger and annihilate them from under the heavens of Jehovah .
How dark the gold has become ! How changed is the best gold ! The stones of the holy place are dropping out at the top of every street .
The valued sons of Zion are valued like the best gold . They are looked on as vessels of earth , the work of the hands of the potter !
Even the jackals of the wasteland have full breasts and give milk to their young ones . The daughter of my people has become cruel like the ostriches in the wasteland .
The tongue of the child at the breast is fixed to the roof of his mouth for need of drink . The young children cry out for bread , and no man gives it to them .
Those used to feasting on delicate food are wasted in the streets . Those who as children were dressed in purple are stretched out on the dust .
The punishment of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of Sodom , which was overturned suddenly without a hand lifted to help her .
Her holy ones were cleaner than snow . They were whiter than milk . Their bodies were redder than corals . Their form was like the sapphire .
Their face is blacker than night . In the streets no one has knowledge of them . Their skin is hanging on their bones , and they are dry , they have become like wood .
Those killed by the sword are better off than those who died of starvation . For these die slowly and waste away from lack of food from the field .
The hands of compassionate women have boiled their own children . They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people .
Jehovah has given full vent to his rage . He has poured out his burning anger . He set a fire in Zion causing the destruction of its foundation .
To the kings of the earth and to all the people of the world it did not seem possible that the attackers and the enemy would enter the gates of Jerusalem .
It is because of the sins of her prophets and the evil doing of her priests . They have drained the blood of the upright out from her .
They are wandering like blind men in the streets . They are polluted with blood . Men may not touch their robes .
» Get away ! Unclean ! « They were cried out to them , » Away ! Away ! Let no one touch . « They went away in flight and wandering , men said among the nations , » There is no further resting-place for them . «
Jehovah has sent them in all directions . He will no longer take care of them . They had no respect for the priests and gave no honor to the elders .
Our eyes are still wasting away in looking for our false help . We watch for a nation unable to give salvation .
They go after our steps so that we may not go in our streets . Our end is near . Our days are numbered . Our end has come .
Those who went after us were quicker than the eagles of the heaven . They drive us before them on the mountains . They wait secretly for us in the wasteland .
The breath of our nostrils , Jehovah’s anointed have been captured in their pits . « We said , » Under the shadow we live among the nations . «
Have joy and be glad , O daughter of Edom , living in the land of Uz . The cup will be given to you in your turn , and you will be overcome with wine and your shame will be seen .
The punishment of your evil doing is complete , O daughter of Zion ; never again will he take you away as a prisoner . He has turned his attention to your error , O daughter of Edom . He has uncovered your sin .
Keep in mind , O Jehovah , what has come to us . Take note and see our shame .
Our heritage is turned over to men of strange lands , our houses to those who are not our countrymen .
We are children without fathers . Our mothers are like widows .
We give money for a drink of water . We get our wood for a price .
Our attackers are on our necks . We are overcome with weariness and we have no rest .
We have given our hands to the Egyptians and to the Assyrians so that we might have enough bread .
Our fathers were sinners and are dead . The weight of their evil deeds is on us .
Servants rule over us , and there is no one to free us from their hands .
We risk our lives to get food , because of the sword of the wasteland .
Our skin is heated like an oven because of our burning heat from the need of food .
They took by force the women in Zion , the virgins in the towns of Judah .
They put princes to death by hanging . The elders are not honored .
The young men crushed the grain , and the boys fell under the wood .
The old men are no longer seated in the doorway . The music of the young men has come to an end .
The joy of our hearts has ended ; our dancing is changed into sorrow .
The crown has been taken from our head . Sorrow is ours , for we are sinners .
Because of this our hearts are feeble . For these things our eyes are dark .
The mountain of Zion is a waste . So jackals go there .
You , O Jehovah , are seated as King forever . The seat of your power is eternal .
Why have we gone from your memory forever ? Why have you turned away from us for so long ?
Make us come back to you , O Jehovah , and let us be restored . Make our days new again as in the past .
But you have rejected us . You are full of wrath against us !
I was living among the exiles by the Chebar River . On the fifth day of the fourth month in the thirtieth year the figurative heaven opened and I saw visions from God .
On the fifth day of the month during the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiakin ,
The word of Jehovah spoke to Ezekiel the priest , son of Buzi . It was in Babylon by the Chebar River . The power of Jehovah came upon him .
I saw a storm coming from the north . There was an immense cloud with flashing lightning surrounded by a bright light . The center of the lightning looked like glowing metal .
In the center of the cloud I saw what looked like four living creatures . They were shaped like humans .
Each of them had four faces and four wings .
Their legs were straight . Their feet were like those of calves and they glittered like polished copper .
They had human hands under their wings on each of their four sides . All four of them had faces and wings .
Their wings touched each other . The creatures went straight ahead and they did not turn as they moved .
Their faces looked like this : From the front , each creature had the face of a human . From the right side , each one had the face of a lion . From the left , each one had the face of a bull . And from the back , each one had the face of an eagle .
That is what their faces looked like . Their wings were spread out and pointed upward . Each creature had two wings with which they touched each other . The other two wings covered their bodies .
Each of the creatures went straight ahead . They went wherever the spirit wanted to go , and they did not turn as they moved .
The living creatures looked like burning coals and torches . Fire moved back and forth between the living creatures . The fire was bright and lightning came out of the fire .
The living creatures ran back and forth like lightning .
As I looked at the living creatures , I saw a wheel on the ground beside each of them , with its four faces .
This is how the wheels looked and how they were made : They looked like beryl chrysolite precious stones . All four wheels looked the same . They looked like a wheel within a wheel .
When they moved , they moved in any of the four directions without turning as they moved .
The rims of the wheels were large and frightening . They were covered with eyes .
When the living creatures moved the wheels moved with them . When the living creatures rose from the earth , the wheels also rose .
Wherever the spirit wanted to go the creatures went . The wheels rose with them , because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels .
When the creatures moved , the wheels moved . When the creatures stood still , the wheels stood still . And when the creatures rose from the earth , the wheels rose with them . This is because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels .
Something like a dome was spread over the heads of the living creatures . It looked like dazzling crystal .
Under the dome , each creature had two wings that were stretched out straight , touching one another . Each creature had two wings that covered its body .
When the creatures moved I heard the sound of their wings . The sound was like the noise of rushing water . It was like the thunder voice of the Almighty . It was like the commotion in an army camp . When the creatures stood still , they lowered their wings .
A voice came from above the dome over their heads as they stood still with their wings lowered .
Above the dome over their heads was something that looked like a throne made of sapphire . On the throne was a figure that looked like a human .
Then I saw what he looked like from the waist up . He looked like glowing copper with fire all around it . From the waist down he looked like fire . A bright light surrounded him .
The brightness all around him looked like a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day . It was the likeness of Jehovah’s glory . When I saw it I immediately fell down with my face to the ground . I heard someone speaking .
He said to me : » Son of man , stand up , and I will speak to you . «
The Spirit entered me when he spoke to me . He stood me on my feet , and I heard him speaking to me .
He said : » Son of man , I am sending you to the people of Israel . They are people from a nation that has rebelled against me . They and their ancestors have transgressed against me to this day .
» I am sending you to these defiant and stubborn children . « Tell them : ‘ This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says :
‘ Whether these rebellious people listen or not , they will realize that a prophet has been among them .
» Son of man , do not be afraid of them or the things they say . Do not be afraid , even though thorns and thistles are around you and you live among scorpions . Do not let the things they say frighten you . Do not be terrified in their presence even though they are rebellious people .
» Speak my words to them whether they listen or not , because they are rebellious .
» But you , son of man , listen to what I say . Do not be rebellious like those rebellious people . Open your mouth and eat what I give you . «
As I looked , I saw a hand stretched out toward me . In it was a scroll .
He slowly spread the scroll in front of me . There was writing on the front and back . There were funeral songs dirges , songs of mourning and horrible things written on it .
Jehovah said to me : » Son of man , eat what you find . Eat this scroll . Then speak to the people of Israel . «
I opened my mouth , and he gave me the scroll to eat .
He said : » Son of man , eat this scroll I am giving you , and fill your stomach with it . « So I ate it , and it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth .
He then said to me : » Son of man , go to the people of Israel and speak my words to them .
» I am not sending you to people whose language is hard to understand or difficult to speak . I am sending you to Israel .
» I am not sending you to nations whose language is hard to understand , difficult to speak , or whose words you cannot understand . If I send you to those nations they will certainly listen to you .
» But the people of Israel will refuse to listen to you because they refuse to listen to me . All the people of Israel are very stubborn and hardheaded .
» Yet , I will make you as stubborn and as hardheaded as they are .
» I will make you as hard as a diamond , harder than flint stone . Do not be afraid of them . Do not be terrified in their presence , even though they are rebellious people . «
He also said : » Son of man , take to heart everything I have spoken to you , and listen closely .
» Go to the exiles , to your people . Whether they listen or not , tell them : This is what the Lord Jehovah says . «
Then the Spirit lifted me , and behind me I heard a loud thundering voice say : » Blessed is Jehovah’s glory from this place . «
I also heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures touching one another and the noise of the wheels beside them as well as a loud rumbling .
The Spirit lifted me and took me away . I went away feeling bitter and angry . The strong power of Jehovah came over me .
I went to Tel Abib , to the exiles that lived by the Chebar River . I sat there among them for seven days . I was stunned among them .
After seven days Jehovah spoke his word to me :
» Son of man , I have made you a watchman over the people of Israel . Listen to what I say , and warn them for me .
» When I tell a wicked man that he will surely die , but you do not warn him or speak out so that he can change his wicked way in order to save his life ; that wicked man will die because of his sin . I will hold you responsible for his death .
» When you warn the wicked man , and he does not turn from his wicked way ; he will die because of his sin , but you will save yourself .
» If righteous people turn from living the right way and do wrong , I will make them stumble and they will die . If you do not warn them , they will die because of their sin . The right things they did will not be remembered . I will hold you responsible for their deaths .
» If you warn righteous people not to sin , and they do not sin , they will certainly live because they listened to the warning and you will save yourself . «
The power of Jehovah came over me . He said : » Get up , and go to the plain . I will speak to you there . «
I got up and went to the plain . Jehovah’s glory was standing there like the glory I saw by the Chebar River . So I immediately bowed down .
The Spirit entered me and stood me on my feet . He talked to me . He said : » Go shut yourself in your home .
» People will tie you up with ropes , son of man , so that you cannot go outside .
» I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you cannot talk or criticize them , even though they are rebellious people .
» But when I speak to you , I will open your mouth . You will tell them : ‘ This is what the Lord Jehovah says . ’ ’ Some will listen and some will refuse to listen for they are a rebellious people .
» Son of man , take a clay tablet and put it in front of you . Draw the city of Jerusalem on it .
» Then lay siege to it . Erect siege works against it . Build a ramp up to it . Set up camps against it and put battering rams around it .
» Take an iron pan and place it as an iron wall between you and the city . Then turn your face toward it . It will be under siege , and you shall besiege it . This will be a sign to the house of Israel .
» Then lie on your left side and put the sin of the house of Israel upon yourself . You are to bear their sin for the number of days you lie on your side .
» I have assigned you the same number of days as the years of their sin . So for three hundred and ninety days you will bear the sin of the house of Israel .
» After you have finished this lie down again . This time lie on your right side , and bear the sin of the house of Judah . I have assigned you forty days , a day for each year .
» Turn your face toward the siege of Jerusalem and with bared arm prophesy against her .
» I will tie you up with ropes so that you cannot turn from one side to the other until you have finished the days of your siege .
» Take wheat and barley , beans and lentils , millet and spelt ; put them in a storage jar and use them to make bread for yourself . You are to eat it during the three hundred and ninety days you lie on your side .
» Weigh out eight ounces of food for each day and eat it at set times .
» You will also have a limited amount of water to drink , two cups a day .
» You are to build a fire out of dried human excrement , bake bread on the fire , and eat it where everyone can see you . «
Jehovah said : » This represents the way the Israelites will have to eat food which the Law forbids when I scatter them to foreign countries . «
But I replied : » No , O Lord Jehovah ! I have never defiled myself . From childhood on I have never eaten meat from any animal that died a natural death or was killed by wild animals . I have never eaten any food considered unclean . «
So God said : » Very well . I will let you use cow dung instead . You can bake your bread on that . «
And he added : » Mortal man , I am going to cut off the supply of bread for Jerusalem . The people there will be distressed and anxious as they measure out the food they eat and the water they drink .
» They will run out of bread and water . They will be in despair . They will waste away because of their sins .
» As for you , son of man , take a sharp sword . Take and use it as a barber's razor to shave your head and beard . Then take scales for weighing and divide the hair .
» You should burn one-third of the hair in the fire at the center of the city when the siege is over . Take one third and strike it with the sword all around the city . The remaining one third you shall scatter to the wind . I will unsheathe a sword behind them .
» Take also a few strands of hair from them and bind them in the edges of your robes .
» Take again some of them and throw them into the fire and burn them in the fire . Fire will spread from there to all the house of Israel .
» This is what the Lord Jehovah says : This is Jerusalem . I have set her at the center of the nations with countries all around her .
» She has rebelled against my ordinances more wickedly than the nations and against my statutes more than the lands that surround her . My people have rejected my ordinances and have not walked in my statutes .
» Therefore , Jehovah says : ‘ You have more turmoil than the nations that surround you . You have not walked in my statutes , nor observed my ordinances , nor observed the ordinances of the nations that surround you . ’
» Therefore , the Lord Jehovah says : ‘ Behold , I , even I , am against you ! I will execute judgments against you in the sight of the nations .
‘ » Because of all your abominations , I will do among you what I have not done before , and the like of which I will never do again .
‘ » Fathers will eat their sons among you and sons will eat their fathers . I will execute judgments against you and scatter your entire remnant to every wind . ’ «
‘ » As I live , declares the Lord Jehovah , ’ ’ ‘ because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable idols and with all your abominations I will withdraw , and my eye will have no pity and I will not spare you .
‘ » One third of your people will die by plague or be consumed by famine ! One third will fall by the sword ! One third I will scatter to every wind ! I will unsheathe a sword behind them war will follow them .
‘ » I will unleash my anger . I will use my fury against you , and I will get revenge . When my fury is unleashed against you , you will know that I , Jehovah , spoke to you with all my zeal .
‘ » I will turn you into a wasteland and an object of ridicule among the nations around you and in the presence of everyone who passes by you .
‘ » The nations that are around you will ridicule you and laugh at you . When I punish you because of my anger , fury , and fierce revenge , you will become something ridiculed and something horrible . I , Jehovah , have spoken .
‘ » When I shoot my destructive arrows of famine at you , I will shoot to kill you . I will bring more and more famine into your land . I will cut off your food supply .
‘ » I will send famine and wild animals against you . They will rob you of your children . I will send plagues , violence , and wars to kill you . I , Jehovah , have spoken ! ’ «
Jehovah continued to speak his word to me :
» Son of man , look toward the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them .
» Say this : ‘ You mountains of Israel listen to the word of the Lord Jehovah ! This is what the Lord Jehovah says to the mountains and hills and to the ravines and valleys : » I am going to attack you with a sword and destroy your worship sites .
‘ » Your altars will be destroyed ! Your incense burners will be smashed . I will kill your people in front of your idols .
‘ » I will lay the dead bodies of the people of Israel in front of your idols . I will even scatter their bones around your altars .
‘ » Your dwelling places in the cities will be ruined , and the worship sites will be wrecked . Your altars will be ruined and demolished . Your idols will be smashed and completely destroyed . Your incense burners will be cut down . Everything you have done will be wiped out .
‘ » Your people will be killed and they will fall among you . Then you will know that I am Jehovah .
‘ » However , I will let some people live . Some people will escape the battle among the nations and be scattered throughout the countries .
» Then those who escape will remember me among the nations where they are taken captive . I was hurt by their adulterous hearts , which turned away from me , and by their eyes , which lusted after idols . They will hate themselves for the evil and disgusting things that they have done .
» Then you will know that I am Jehovah and that the disaster I promised was not an empty threat . « ’
» The Lord Jehovah says : ‘ Clap your hands , stomp your feet , and say , ‘ How sad ! ’ ’ The people of Israel have done evil and disgusting things . So they will die in wars , famines , and plagues .
‘ » Plagues will kill those who are far away . Those who are near will die in wars . Anyone who is left and has escaped will die of famine . This is how I will unleash my rage .
» Then you will know that I am Jehovah . Those who are killed will lie beside the idols around their altars . They will lie on every high hill , on all the mountaintops , and under every large tree and every leafy oak . These are the places where they made offerings to their disgusting idols .
‘ » I will stretch out my hand use my power against them and destroy the land from the desert to Diblah . THEN THEY WILL KNOW THAT I AM JEHOVAH ! ’ «
The word of Jehovah came to me :
» Son of man , the Lord Jehovah says to the land of Israel : ‘ The end ! The end has come upon the four corners of the land .
‘ » The end is now upon you and I will unleash my anger against you . I will judge you according to your conduct and repay you for all your detestable practices .
‘ » I will not look on you with pity or spare you . I will repay you for your conduct and the detestable practices among you . THEN YOU WILL KNOW THAT I AM JEHOVAH . ’
» The Lord Jehovah says : ‘ Disaster ! An unheard-of disaster is coming .
‘ » The end has come ! The end has come ! It has become active against you . It has come !
‘ » Doom has come upon you who dwell in the land . The time has come , the day is near . There is panic , not joy , upon the mountains .
‘ » I am about to pour out my wrath on you and spend my anger against you . I will judge you according to your conduct and repay you for all your detestable practices .
‘ » I will not look on you with pity or spare you my eye will not feel sorry for you . I will repay you in accordance with your conduct and the detestable practices among you . Then you will know that it is I , Jehovah , who strikes the blow .
‘ » The day is here ! It has come ! Doom has burst forth . The rod has budded , and arrogance has blossomed !
‘ » Violence has grown into a weapon for punishing wickedness . None of the people will be left . None of that crowd , none of their wealth , and nothing of value will be left .
‘ » The time is coming . The day is near . Buyers will not rejoice , and sellers will not mourn , because my fury will be against the whole crowd .
‘ » Sellers will not live long enough to buy back what they have sold . The visions against that crowd will not change . Because of their sins , none of the people will live .
‘ » They have blown a ram's horn and everything is ready . But no one will go into battle , because my fury is against their whole crowd .
‘ » Outside are swords and inside are plagues and famines . He who is in a field will die in battle . He who is in the city will be devoured by famines and plagues .
‘ » Some will escape to the mountains like doves frightened from the valleys . All of them will moan over their sins .
‘ » Everyone’s hands will be weak , and their knees will shake and they will drip from sweat .
‘ » They will put on sackcloth and they will tremble all over . Their heads will be shaved , and they will all be disgraced .
‘ » They will throw their gold and silver away in the streets like garbage like an abhorrent thing , because neither silver nor gold can save them when Jehovah pours out his fury . They cannot use it to satisfy their desires or fill their stomachs . Gold and silver led them into sin .
‘ » Once they were proud of their beautiful jewels , but they used them to make disgusting idols . That is why Jehovah has made their wealth repulsive to them .
‘ » I will hand it all over as plunder to foreigners and as loot to the wicked of the earth , and they will defile it .
‘ » I will turn my face away from them . They will desecrate my treasured place . Robbers will enter it and desecrate it .
‘ » Prepare chains for the land is full of bloodshed and the city full of violence .
‘ » I will bring the wicked of the nations to take possession of their houses . I will put an end to the pride of the mighty , and their sanctuaries will be desecrated .
‘ » When terror comes they will seek peace , but there will be none .
‘ » Calamity upon calamity will come , and rumor upon rumor . They will try to get a vision from the prophet . The teaching of the law by the priest will be lost , as will the counsel of the elders .
‘ » The king will mourn . The prince will be clothed with despair and the hands of the people of the land will tremble . I will deal with them according to their conduct . By their own standards I will judge them . Then they will know that I am Jehovah . ’ «
On the fifth day of the sixth month in the sixth year , I was sitting in my home . Judah's older men were sitting in front of me . The power of the Lord Jehovah came over me .
As I looked , I saw something that looked like a human . From the waist down its body looked like fire , and from the waist up its body looked like bright glowing metal .
It stretched out what looked like a hand and grabbed me by the hair on my head . In these visions from God , the Spirit carried me between heaven and earth . He took me in vision to Jerusalem , to the entrance of the north gate of the inner court , where the seat of the idol of jealousy , which provokes to jealousy , was located .
There I saw the glory of Israel's God as I did in the vision that I saw in the valley .
God said to me : » Son of man , look toward the north . « So I looked toward the north . There in the entrance to the north gate beside the altar , I saw the idol that provokes jealousy and stirs up God's anger .
He asked me : » Son of man , do you see what the people of Israel are doing ? The people of Israel are doing very disgusting things here , things that will force me to go far away from my holy place . But you will see even more disgusting things . «
Then he took me to the entrance of the courtyard . As I looked , I saw a hole in the wall .
He said to me : » Son of man , dig through the wall . So I dug through the wall , and I saw a door . «
He said : » Go in and see the wicked abominations abhorrences that they are committing here . «
So I entered and looked , and behold , every form of creeping things and beasts and detestable things . There were all the idols of the house of Israel . They were carved on the wall all around .
Standing in front of them were seventy elders of the house of Israel . Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan stood among them . Each man had his censer in his hand and the fragrance of the cloud of incense was rising .
Then he said : » Son of man , do you see what the elders of the house of Israel are committing in the dark , each man in the room of his carved images ? For they say : ‘ Jehovah does not see us ! Jehovah has forsaken the land ! ’ «
He said : » Yet you will see still greater abominations that they are committing . «
Then he brought me to the entrance of the gate of Jehovah’s house toward the north ; and I saw women sitting there weeping for Tammuz the god .
He said to me : » Do you see this , son of man ? Yet you will see still greater abominations than these . «
So he took me to the inner courtyard of the Temple . There near the entrance of the sanctuary , between the altar and the porch , were about twenty-five men . They turned their backs to the sanctuary and were bowing low toward the east , worshiping the rising sun .
Jehovah said to me : » Mortal man , do you see that ? These people of Judah are not satisfied with merely doing all the disgusting things you have seen here and with spreading violence throughout the country . No , they must come and do them right here in the Temple and make me even angrier . Look how they insult me in the most offensive way possible by thrusting the shoot to my nose ! an obsene reference or jesture to Jehovah
» They will feel all the force of my anger . I will not spare them or show them any mercy my eye will not feel sorry . They will shout prayers to me as loud as they can . But I will not listen to them «
God shouted with a loud voice : » Come here , you men who are going to punish the city . Bring your weapons with you ! «
Six men came from the direction of the upper gate that faces north . Each had his shattering weapon in his hand . Among them was a certain man clothed in linen with a writing case secretary’s inkhorn at his side . They went in and stood beside the copper altar .
Then the dazzling light of the presence of the God of Israel rose up from the winged creatures where it had been . It moved to the entrance of the Temple . Jehovah called to the man dressed in linen :
» Go through the whole city of Jerusalem and put a mark signature on the forehead of everyone who is distressed and troubled because of all the disgusting things being done in the city . «
I heard God say to the other men : » Follow him through the city and kill . Spare no one ! Have mercy on no one .
» Kill the old men , young men , young women , mothers , and children . But do not touch anyone who has the mark on his forehead . Start here at my Temple . « So they began with the elders who were standing there at the Temple .
He said to them : » Dishonor the Temple ! Fill its courtyards with dead people , and then leave . « So they went out and killed the people in the city .
While they were killing people , I was left alone . So I immediately bowed down . I cried : » Help me O Lord Jehovah . Will you destroy everyone who is left in Israel while you pour out your anger on Jerusalem ? «
He answered me : » The wickedness of the nations of Israel and Judah is terrible ! The land is filled with murder , and the city is filled with wrongdoing . They think that Jehovah has abandoned the land and that he does not see .
» But my eye will not feel sorry I will not have compassion or feel sorry . I will do to them what they have done to others . «
Then the person dressed in linen who was carrying the writing case inkhorn reported : » I did everything you commanded . «
I looked at the dome over the heads of the angels . And I saw something that looked like a throne made of sapphire .
Jehovah said to the person dressed in linen : » Go between the wheels under the angels and fill your hands with burning coals . Then scatter them over the city . « So he went between the wheels as I watched .
The angels cherubs were standing on the south side of the Temple as the person went . A cloud filled the inner courtyard .
Jehovah’s glory rose from the angels to the entrance of the Temple . The cloud filled the Temple , and the brightness of Jehovah’s glory filled the courtyard .
The sound of the angels' wings was heard as far as the outer courtyard . It was like the sound of the Almighty God when he speaks .
After Jehovah had commanded the person dressed in linen to take burning coals from between the wheels beside the angels , the person went in and stood beside one of the wheels .
One of the angels reached into the fire that was between the angels and took out some coals . This angel put them in the hands of the person dressed in linen . The person took them and left .
I saw that each creature had what looked like a human hand under each of its wings .
Then I looked , and behold , four wheels beside the angels . There was one wheel beside each angel . The appearance of the wheels was like the gleam of a chrysolite stone .
All four of them had the same likeness in appearance , as if one wheel was within another wheel .
When they moved , they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went . They followed in the direction that they faced , without turning as they went .
Their whole body , their backs , their hands , their wings and the wheels were full of eyes all around . The wheels belonged to all four of them .
The wheels were called in my hearing , the whirling wheels .
Each one had four faces . The first face was the face of a cherub angel , the second face was the face of a man , the third the face of a lion , and the fourth the face of an eagle .
The angels rose . These were the living creatures that I saw at the Chebar River .
When the angels moved , the wheels moved beside them . When the angels lifted their wings to rise from the ground , the wheels did not leave their side .
When the angels stood still , the wheels stood still . When the angels rose , the wheels rose with them . The spirit of the living creatures was in them the wheels .
Then the glory of Jehovah left the Temple's entrance and stood over the angels .
The angels lifted their wings and rose from the ground . I was watching them as they left with the wheels beside them . The angels stood at the door to the east gate of Jehovah’s Temple , and the glory of the God of Israel was above them .
These are the living creatures that I saw under the God of Israel at the Chebar River . I realized that they were angels cherubs .
Each had four faces and four wings , and under their wings were what looked like human hands .
Their faces looked exactly like the faces that I saw by the Chebar River . Each one went straight ahead .
The Spirit lifted me and took me to the east gate of Jehovah’s Temple . It is the gate that faces east . Twenty-five men were at the entrance of the gate . I saw among them Azzur's son Jaazaniah and Benaiah's son Pelatiah . They were leaders of the people .
Jehovah said to me : » Son of man , these are the men who plan evil and give bad advice in this city Jerusalem .
» They say : ‘ It is almost time to rebuild houses . This city is a cooking pot , and we are the meat . ’
» So prophesy against them . Prophesy , son of man . «
Jehovah’s Spirit came to me and told me to say : » This is what Jehovah says : ‘ You are saying these things , nation of Israel . But I know what is going through your mind .
‘ » You have killed many people in this city and have filled its streets with corpses . « ’
» I , the Lord Jehovah , say to you : ‘ This city is a cooking pot all right , but what is the meat ? The corpses of those you have killed ! You will not be here . I will throw you out of the city ! ’ «
‘ » Are you afraid of swords ? I will bring soldiers with swords to attack you , ’ ’ is the utterance of Jehovah .
‘ I will take you out of the city and hand you over to foreigners . I will execute judgments against you .
‘ » You will be killed in battle in your own country . I will judge you on the border of Israel . Then everyone will know that I am Jehovah .
‘ » This city will not protect you the way a cooking pot protects the meat in it . I will punish you wherever you may be in the land of Israel .
‘ » You will know that I am Jehovah ! While you were keeping the laws of the neighboring nations , you were breaking my laws and disobeying my commands . ’ «
» It happened while I prophesied , that Pelatiah son of Benaiah died . Then I fell on my face and cried out with a loud voice and said : Alas , O Lord Jehovah ! Will you bring the remnant of Israel to a complete end ? «
Then the word of Jehovah came to me , He said :
» Son of man , your brothers , your relatives , your fellow exiles and the whole house of Israel , all of them are those to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said : ‘ Go far from Jehovah . This land has been given us as a possession . ’
» Therefore say : ‘ Thus says the Lord Jehovah : » Though I had removed them far away among the nations and though I had scattered them among the countries , yet I was a sanctuary holy place shelter protection for them a little while in the countries where they had gone . « ’
» Therefore say , ‘ The Lord Jehovah says : » I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you out of the countries among which you have been scattered . I will give you the land of Israel .
‘ » When they come there , they will remove all its detestable things and all its abominations from it .
‘ » I will give them one united heart , and put a new spirit within them . I will take the heart of stone unkind attitude out of them and give them a heart of flesh loving disposition .
‘ » In this way they may walk in my statutes and obey my ordinances . Then they will be my people , and I will be their God .
‘ » Concerning those whose hearts go after their detestable things and abominations , I will bring their conduct down on their heads , declares the Lord Jehovah . ’ «
Then the cherubim angels lifted up their wings with the wheels beside them , and the glory of the God of Israel hovered over them .
The glory of Jehovah went up from within the city and stood over the mountain that is east of the city .
The Spirit lifted me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God to the exiles in Chaldea . So the vision that I had seen left me .
Then I told the exiles all the things that Jehovah had shown me .
Jehovah continued to speak his word to me , He said :
» Son of man , you are living among rebellious people . They have eyes , but they cannot see . They have ears , but they cannot hear because they are rebellious people .
» Son of man , pack your bags as if you were going into exile . Let the people see you leave in the daylight . March like a captive from your place to another place as they watch . Maybe they will understand , even though they are a rebellious people house .
» Bring out your bags as if you were going into exile . Let them see this in the daylight . In the evening let them see you leave like a captive going into exile .
» Dig a hole through the wall of your house , as they watch , and leave through it .
» Let them see you put your bags on your shoulders and carry them out in the dark . Cover your face so that you won't see the land . I have made you a sign to warn the nation of Israel . «
I did what I was ordered to do . During the day I brought out bags as if I were going into exile . In the evening I dug a hole through the wall . I brought out my bags in the dark . I let the people see me as I carried my bags on my shoulders .
The next morning Jehovah spoke his word to me , He said :
» Son of man , did the rebellious nation of Israel ask you what you were doing ?
» Tell them : This is what the Lord Jehovah says : ‘ This is the divine revelation about the prince from Jerusalem and about all the people of Israel who live there . ’ «
» Tell them : ‘ I am your warning sign . What I have done will happen to you . You will go into exile and into captivity .
‘ » The prince who is among you will put his bags on his shoulders in the dark and leave . People will dig holes in the wall to go through . The prince will cover his face so that he cannot see the land . ’ «
» I will also spread my net over him , and he will be caught in my snare . And I will bring him to Babylon in the land of the Chaldeans . Yet he will not see it , though he will die there .
» I will scatter to every wind all who are around him , his helpers and all his troops . I will draw out a sword after them .
» So they will know that I am Jehovah when I scatter them among the nations and spread them among the countries .
» I will spare a few of them from the sword , the famine and the pestilence that they may tell all their abominations among the nations where they go , and may know that I am Jehovah . «
Moreover , the word of Jehovah came to me , He said :
» Son of man , eat your bread with trembling and drink your water with quivering and anxiety .
» Then say to the people of the land : ‘ The Lord Jehovah says concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of Israel , They will eat their bread with anxiety and drink their water with horror , because their land will be stripped of its fullness on account of the violence of all who live in it .
‘ » The inhabited cities will be laid waste and the land will be a desolation . So you will know that I am Jehovah . « ’
Then the word of Jehovah came to me :
» Son of man , what is this proverb you people have concerning the land of Israel . You say : ‘ The days are long and every vision fails ? ’
» Therefore say to them : ‘ The Lord Jehovah says : ‘ I will make this proverb cease so that they will no longer use it as a proverb in Israel . Tell them : ‘ The days draw near as well as the fulfillment of every vision . ’
» There will no longer be any false visions or flattering fortune telling to the people .
» I Jehovah will speak . Everything that I say will happen without any more delay . I will say something , and it will happen during your rebellious lifetime , « declares the Almighty God Jehovah .
Jehovah continued to speak his word to me :
» Son of man , the people of Israel are saying , ‘ The vision that Ezekiel sees will not happen for a long time . What he prophecies will happen in the distant future . ’
» Tell them : ‘ This is what the Lord Jehovah says : ’ ’ » Everything that I say will no longer be delayed . Whatever I say will happen , declares the Lord Jehovah . « ’ «
The word of Jehovah continued to come to me :
» Son of man , prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy , and say to those who prophesy from their own heart inspiration : ‘ Listen to the word of Jehovah !
‘ The Lord Jehovah said : » Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing .
‘ » O Israel , your prophets have been like foxes among ruins .
‘ » You have not gone up into the gaps broken places of the wall around the house of Israel . You did not build the wall to stand in the battle on the day of Jehovah . «
» They see falsehood and lying divination . They are saying : ‘ Jehovah declares , ’ ’ when Jehovah has not sent them . Yet they hope for the fulfillment of their word .
‘ » Did you not see a false vision and speak a lying divination when you said ‘ Jehovah declares , ’ ’ but it is not I who has spoken ? « ’
‘ » Therefore , the Lord Jehovah says : ‘ » Because you have spoken falsehood and seen a lie , therefore behold , I am against you , ’ ’ declares the Lord Jehovah . «
‘ » My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and utter lying divinations . They will have no place in the council of my people . They will not be written down in the register of the house of Israel . And they will not enter the land of Israel , that you may know that I am the Lord Jehovah .
‘ » It is definitely because they have misled my people by saying , » Peace ! « When there is no peace . And when anyone builds a wall they plaster it over with whitewash . ’
» So tell those who plaster it over with whitewash , that it will fall . A flooding rain will come , and you , O hailstones , will fall ; and a violent wind will break out .
» When the wall has fallen , will you not be asked : Where is the plaster with which you plastered it ? ’
» This is what the Lord Jehovah says : ‘ In my fury I will cause a storm to break out . In my anger rain will pour down , and hailstones will destroy the wall .
‘ » I will tear down the wall that the prophets covered up with whitewash . I will level it and expose its foundation . When the wall falls , they will be destroyed by it . Then you will know that I am Jehovah . ’
‘ » I will unleash my rage on the wall and on those who covered it up with paint . Then I will say to you : The wall is gone , and so are those who painted it .
‘ » The prophets of Israel who prophesied to Jerusalem are gone . Those who said that everything was all right , when it was not all right , are gone , declares the Lord Jehovah .
» Son of man , look at the women among your people who make up prophesies , and prophesy against them .
» Tell them , ‘ This is what the Lord Jehovah says : » How horrible it will be for women who sew magic charms for people's wrists and make magic veils of every size for people's heads . You want to trap people . You want to control the lives of my people for your own profit .
‘ » You dishonor me in front of my people for a few handfuls of barley and a few pieces of bread . You kill people who should not die . You spare the lives of people who should not live . You lie to my people who are willing to listen . « ’
» This is what the Lord Jehovah says : ‘ I am against the magic charms that you use to trap people like birds . I will tear them from your arms and free the people that you have trapped .
‘ » I will tear off your magic veils and rescue my people from your power so that they will no longer be under your control . Then you will know that I am Jehovah .
‘ » You have discouraged righteous people with your lies , even though I had not brought them any grief . You encouraged wicked people not to turn from their wicked ways to save their lives .
‘ » That is why you will no longer see false visions or make predictions . I will rescue my people from your power . Then you will know that I am Jehovah . ’ «
Some of Israel's elders came to me and sat down in front of me .
Jehovah then spoke his word to me :
» Son of man , these people are devoted to their idols . They allow themselves to sin . Should they be allowed to ask me for anything ?
» Speak to them . Tell them , ‘ This is what Jehovah says : Suppose an Israelite is devoted to idols and allows himself to sin . Suppose he goes to a prophet to ask for my help . I , Jehovah , will give that Israelite an answer , the answer that his many idolaters deserve .
» ‘ I will do this to recapture the hearts of the nation of Israel . They have deserted me because of their disgusting idols . ’ «
» Therefore tell the nation of Israel : This is what the Lord Jehovah says : » Change the way you think and act ! Repent ! Turn away from your idols , and do not return to any of your disgusting things .
‘ » Suppose an Israelite or a foreigner who lives in Israel deserts me by devoting himself to idols and by allowing himself to sin . If he goes to a prophet to ask for my help , I , Jehovah , will give him an answer .
‘ » I will set my face against him reject him , and I will make an example of him . I will exclude him from my people . Then you will know that I am Jehovah . ’ «
» ‘ If a prophet is tricked into giving a prophecy , it is I , Jehovah , who tricked the prophet . I will use my power against you and destroy you from among my people Israel .
‘ » Both of you will suffer for your sins . The prophet will be as guilty as you are when you ask for his help .
‘ » The people of Israel will no longer wander away from me . They will no longer dishonor me with all their sins . Then they will be my people , and I will be their God , declares the Lord Jehovah . «
Jehovah continued to speak his word to me , He said :
» Son of man , suppose a country sins against me by being unfaithful to me . I will stretch out my hand use my power against it , cut off its food supply , send a famine to it , and destroy its people and animals . «
‘ » Even if these three men , Noah , Daniel , and Job , were in that country , they would , by their righteousness , rescue only themselves , ’ ’ declares the Lord Jehovah . «
‘ » If I send wild animals through that country and they make it childless and turn it into such a wasteland that no one travels through it because of the animals .
‘ » As I live , declares the Lord Jehovah , ‘ not even Noah , Daniel , and Job could rescue their own sons or daughters . They could rescue only themselves and the country would become a wasteland . ’ «
‘ » What if I bring a war against that country by saying I will let a war go throughout this country . And then I destroy the people and the animals in it .
‘ » As I am alive , declares the Lord Jehovah , not even Noah , Daniel , and Job could rescue their sons or daughters . They alone would be saved . ’ «
‘ » Let us say I send a plague into that country or pour out my fury on it by killing people and destroying animals .
As I am alive , declares the Lord Jehovah , not even Noah , Daniel , and Job could , by their righteousness , rescue their sons or daughters . They could rescue only themselves . « ’
‘ » This is what the Lord Jehovah says : ‘ I will surely send four terrible punishments against Jerusalem . I will send wars , famines , wild animals , and plagues . They will destroy people and animals .
‘ » And yet some people will survive . Some of your sons and daughters will be brought out . When they come out to you , you will see how they live . Then you will be comforted after the disasters that I will bring on Jerusalem , after every disaster that I will bring against it . ’ «
‘ » You will be comforted when you see how they live . Then you will know that everything I have done was done for a reason , ’ ’ declares the Lord Jehovah . ’ «
Jehovah continued to speak his word to me :
» Son of man , how is the wood of the vine better than any wood of a branch among the trees of the forest ?
» Can wood be taken from it to make anything ? Can men take a peg from it on which to hang any vessel ?
» After it has been put into the fire for fuel , and the fire has consumed both of its ends and its middle part has been charred , is it then useful for anything ?
» While it is intact , it is not made into anything . How much less , when the fire has consumed it and it is charred , can it still be made into anything ? «
» Therefore , the Lord Jehovah says : ‘ Just like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest , which I have given as fuel for the fire , so have I given up the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
I will set my face against them turn against them . Though they have come out of the fire , yet the fire will consume them . Then you will know that I am Jehovah , when I set my face against them . ’ «
‘ » I will make the land desolate , because they have acted unfaithfully , ’ ’ declares the Lord Jehovah . «
The word of Jehovah came to me :
» Son of man , confront Jerusalem with her detestable practices .
» Say this , ‘ The Lord Jehovah says this to Jerusalem : » Your ancestry and birth were in the land of the Canaanites . Your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite .
» ‘ » On the day you were born your cord was not cut , nor were you washed with water to make you clean , nor were you rubbed with salt or wrapped in cloths .
» ‘ » No one looked on you with pity or had compassion enough to do any of these things for you . Instead , you were thrown out into the open field , for on the day you were born you were despised .
» ‘ » When I passed by you and saw you squirming in your blood , I said to you while you were in your blood , ‘ Live ! ’ ’ Yes , I said to you while you were in your blood , ‘ Live ! ’
» ‘ I made you numerous like plants of the field . You grew up , became tall and reached the age for fine ornaments . Your breasts were formed and your hair had grown . Yet you were naked and bare . « ’
» ‘ Then I passed by you and saw that you were at the time for love . So I spread my skirt over you and covered your nakedness . I also swore to you and entered into a covenant with you so that you became mine , declares the Lord Jehovah .
» ‘ Then I bathed you with water , washed off your blood from you and anointed you with oil .
» ‘ I also clothed you with embroidered cloth and put sandals of porpoise skin on your feet . I wrapped you with fine linen and covered you with silk .
» ‘ I adorned you with ornaments , put bracelets on your hands and a necklace around your neck . ’ «
» ‘ I also put a ring in your nostril , earrings in your ears and a beautiful crown on your head .
» ‘ You were adorned with gold and silver . Your dress was of fine linen , silk and embroidered cloth . You ate fine flour , honey and oil ; so you were exceedingly beautiful and advanced to royalty .
» ‘ You became famous in every nation because of your beauty . Your beauty was perfect because I gave you my glory , ’ ’ declares the Lord Jehovah . «
» ‘ But you trusted your beauty . You used your fame to become a prostitute . You had sex with everyone who walked by .
» ‘ You took some of your clothes and made your worship sites colorful . This is where you acted like a prostitute . Such things should not happen . They should not occur .
» ‘ You took your beautiful gold and silver jewelry that I had given you and made male idols for yourself . Then you committed adultery with them .
» ‘ You took off your embroidered clothes and covered the idols with them . You offered my olive oil and incense in their presence .
» ‘ You also offered them sweet and fragrant sacrifices . You gave flour , olive oil , and honey-all the food that I gave you to eat . This is what happened , ’ ’ declares the Lord Jehovah . «
» ‘ You took your sons and daughters , who belonged to me , and you sacrificed them as food to idols . Was your prostitution not enough ?
» ‘ You slaughtered my children and presented them as burnt offerings to idols .
» ‘ During your disgusting life as a prostitute you never once remembered your childhood , when you were naked , squirming in your own blood . ’ «
The Lord Jehovah said : » You are doomed ! Doomed ! You did all that evil , and then
by the side of every road you built places to worship idols and practice prostitution .
» You dragged your beauty through the mud . You offered yourself to everyone who came by , and you were more of a prostitute every day .
» You let your lustful neighbors , the Egyptians , go to bed with you , and you used your prostitution to make me angry .
» Now I have raised my hand to punish you and to take away your share of my blessing . I have handed you over to the Philistines , who hate you . They are also disgusted with your immoral actions .
» The others did not satisfy you so you ran after the Assyrians . You were their prostitute , but they did not satisfy you either .
» You were also a prostitute for the Babylonians , that nation of merchants , but they did not satisfy you either .
» I , the Lord Jehovah am furious with you . You were so disgusting that you would have done anything to get what you wanted .
» You had sex on every street corner , and when you finished , you refused to accept money . That is worse than being a prostitute !
» You are an unfaithful wife who would rather have sex with strangers than with your own husband .
» Prostitutes accept money for having sex , but you bribe men from everywhere to have sex with you .
» You are not like other prostitutes . Men do not ask you for sex . You offer to pay them !
» Jerusalem , you prostitute , listen to the word of Jehovah .
» You chased after lovers , then took off your clothes and had sex . You even worshiped disgusting idols and sacrificed your own children as offerings to them .
» So I , the Lord Jehovah , will gather every one of your lovers , those you liked and those you hated . They will stand around you , and I will rip off your clothes and let all of those lovers stare at your nakedness .
» I will judge you like women who commit adultery or shed blood are judged . I will bring on you the blood of wrath and jealousy .
» I will also give you into the hands of your lovers . They will tear down your shrines , demolish your high places , strip you of your clothing , take away your jewels , and will leave you naked and bare .
» They will incite a crowd against you and they will stone you and cut you to pieces with their swords .
» They will burn your houses with fire and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women . Then I will stop you from playing the harlot . You will also no longer pay your lovers .
» I will calm my fury against you and my indignation will depart from you . I will be pacified and angry no more .
‘ » You have not remembered the days of your youth but have enraged me by all these things . I will therefore bring your conduct down on your own head , ’ ’ declares the Lord Jehovah . ‘ That way you will not commit this lewdness on top of all your other abominations .
‘ » Everyone who quotes proverbs will quote this proverb concerning you : » Like mother , like daughter . «
‘ » You are the daughter of your mother , who loathed her husband and children . You are also the sister of your sisters , who loathed their husbands and children . Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite .
‘ » Now your older sister is Samaria , who lives north of you with her daughters . Your younger sister , who lives south of you , is Sodom with her daughters .
‘ » Yet you have not merely walked in their ways or done according to their abominations ; but , as if that were too little , you acted more corruptly in all your conduct than they .
‘ » As I am alive , ’ ’ declares the Lord Jehovah , ‘ Sodom , your sister and her daughters have not done as you and your daughters have done .
‘ » This was the guilt of your sister Sodom . She and her daughters had arrogance , abundant food and careless ease , but she did not help the poor and needy .
‘ » They were arrogant and did disgusting things in front of me . So I did away with them when I saw this .
‘ » Samaria did not commit half the sins you did . You have done many more disgusting things than they ever did . Because of all the disgusting things that you have done , you make your sisters look innocent .
‘ » You will have to suffer disgrace because you accused your sisters . Yet , your sins are more disgusting than theirs . They look like they are innocent compared to you . Be ashamed of yourself and suffer disgrace , because you have made your sisters look like they are innocent . ’
‘ » I will restore the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters , and Samaria and her daughters . I will also restore your fortune along with theirs .
‘ » You will have to suffer disgrace and be ashamed of everything you have done , including comforting them .
‘ » When Sodom and her daughters and Samaria and her daughters return to what they once were , you and your daughters will return to what you once were .
‘ » You did not mention your sister Sodom when you were arrogant .
‘ » You did not mention her before your wickedness was revealed . Now the daughters of Aram and their neighbors despise you . The daughters of the Philistines also despise you . Those around you hate you .
‘ » You must suffer because of all the crude and disgusting things you have done , ’ ’ declares Jehovah . «
» The Lord Jehovah says : ‘ I will treat you the way you deserve , because you ignored your promises and broke the covenant .
‘ » I will honor the covenant I made with you when you were young . I will make a covenant with you that will last forever .
‘ » You will remember how you have acted , and be ashamed of it when you get your older sister and your younger sister back . I will let them be like daughters to you , even though this was not part of my covenant with you . ’
‘ » I will renew my covenant with you , and you will know that I am Jehovah .
‘ » I will forgive all the wrongs you have done , but you will remember them and be too ashamed to open your mouth . ’ ’ The Lord Jehovah has spoken . «
Jehovah continued to speak his word to me :
» Son of man , tell this riddle . Give this illustration to the nation of Israel .
‘ Say The Lord Jehovah says : » A large eagle came to Lebanon . It had large wings with long , colorful feathers . It took hold of the top of a cedar tree .
» ‘ » It broke off the highest twig and carried it to a country of merchants . It planted the twig in a city of merchants .
» ‘ » Then it took a seedling from that country and planted the seedling in fertile soil . The eagle planted the seedling like a willow where there was plenty of water .
» ‘ » The plant sprouted and grew into a low vine that spread over the ground . Its branches turned upward toward the eagle . Its roots grew downward . Thus it became a vine , producing branches and growing shoots .
» ‘ » There was another large eagle with large wings and many feathers . Now , the vine stretched its roots toward this eagle and sent its branches toward the eagle so that the eagle could water it . The vine turned away from the garden where it was planted .
» ‘ » It was planted in good soil beside plenty of water so that it could grow branches , bear fruit , and become a wonderful vine . « ’
» Say , ‘ The Lord Jehovah says : » Will it thrive ? Will he not pull up its roots and cut off its fruit , so that it and all its sprouting leaves wither ? And neither by great strength nor by many people can it be raised from its roots again .
» ‘ » Though it is transplanted , will it thrive ? Will it not completely wither as soon as the east wind strikes it , wither on the beds where it grew ? « ’ «
Moreover , the word of Jehovah came to me :
» Say now to the rebellious house : Do you not know what these things mean ? Say , Behold , the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem , took its king and princes and brought them to him in Babylon .
» He took one of the royal family and made a covenant with him , putting him under oath . He also took away the mighty of the land ,
that the kingdom might be in subjection , not exalting itself , but keeping his covenant that it might continue .
» But he rebelled against him ! He sent his envoys to Egypt that they might give him horses and many troops . Will he succeed ? Will he who does such things escape ? Can he indeed break the covenant and escape ? ’
» ‘ » As I am alive , ’ ’ says the Lord Jehovah , ‘ this king will die in Babylon because he broke his oath and the treaty with the one who put him on the throne the king of Babylon .
‘ » Even the powerful army of the king of Egypt will not be able to help him fight when the Babylonians build earthworks and dig trenches in order to kill many people .
‘ » He broke his oath and the treaty he had made . He did all these things , and now he will not escape . « ’
‘ » The Lord Jehovah says : » As surely as I am the living God , I will punish him for breaking the treaty that he swore in my name to keep .
‘ » I will spread out a hunter's net and catch him in it . I will take him to Babylon and punish him there , because he was unfaithful to me .
‘ » His best troops will be killed in battle , and the survivors will be scattered in every direction . I Jehovah have spoken . « ’
» ‘ Someday , I , Jehovah , will cut a tender twig from the top of a cedar tree . I will then plant it on the peak of Israel's tallest mountain , where it will grow strong branches and produce large fruit .
» ‘ All kinds of birds will find shelter under the tree , and they will rest in the shade of its branches .
‘ » Every tree in the forest will know that I , Jehovah , can bring down tall trees and help short ones grow . I dry up green trees and make dry ones green . I , Jehovah , have spoken , and I will keep my word . « ’ «
Jehovah’s word continued to come to me :
» What do you mean by using this proverb concerning the land of Israel : ‘ The fathers eat sour grapes , but the children's teeth are set on edge ? ’
‘ » As I live , declares the Lord Jehovah : ‘ You are surely not going to use this proverb in Israel anymore .
‘ » The life of every person belongs to me . The life of the father as well as the life of the son is mine . The person who sins will die .
‘ » If a man is righteous and practices justice and righteousness ,
and does not eat at the mountain shrines or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , or defile his neighbor's wife or approach a woman during her menstrual period ;
‘ » if a man does not oppress anyone , but restores to the debtor his pledge , does not commit robbery , but gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with clothing .
‘ » If he does not lend money on interest or take increase , if he keeps his hand from iniquity and executes true justice between man and man ,
‘ » if he lives by my rules and obeys my laws faithfully this person is righteous . He will certainly live , ’ ’ declares the Lord Jehovah .
‘ » Suppose this person has a son who robs and murders . The son does all these other things
that his father never did . He eats at the illegal mountain worship sites . He dishonors his neighbor's wife .
‘ » He oppresses the poor and needy . He robs . He does not return the security for a loan . He looks to idols for help . He does disgusting things .
‘ » He lends money for interest and makes excessive profits . Will this person live ? He will not live . He has done all these disgusting things . So he must die , and he will be responsible for his own death .
‘ » Now suppose this son has a son . The son sees all the sins that his father does . He is afraid , so he does not do such things .
‘ » He does not eat at the illegal mountain worship sites or look for help from the idols of the nation of Israel . He does not dishonor his neighbor's wife .
‘ » He does not oppress anyone . He does not keep the security for a loan . He does not rob anyone . He gives food to people who are hungry , and he gives clothes to those who are naked .
‘ » He keeps his hand from the poor and does not take interest or increase , but executes my ordinances , and walks in my statutes . He will not die for his father's iniquity . He will surely live .
‘ » As for his father , because he practiced extortion , robbed his brother and did what was not good among his people , he will die for his iniquity .
‘ » Yet you say : » Why should the son not bear the punishment for the father's iniquity ? « When the son has practiced justice and righteousness and has observed all my statutes and done them , he shall surely live .
‘ » The person who sins will die . The son will not bear the punishment for the father's iniquity , nor will the father bear the punishment for the son's iniquity . The righteousness of the righteous will be upon himself . And the wickedness of the wicked will be upon himself .
‘ » If the wicked man turns from all his sins and observes all my statutes and practices justice and righteousness , he shall live ; he shall not die .
‘ » All his transgressions he has committed will not be remembered against him . He will live because of his righteousness he has practiced . ’
‘ » Do I have any pleasure in the death of the wicked , declares the Lord Jehovah , that he should turn from his ways and live ?
‘ » But suppose a righteous person turns away from doing right and he does evil things . He does all the disgusting things that the wicked person did . Will he live ? All the right things that he has done will not be remembered because of his unfaithfulness and because of his sin . He will die because of them .
‘ » But you say : » Jehovah’s way is unfair . « Listen , nation of Israel , is my way fair ? Is it your ways that are unfair ?
‘ » When a righteous person turns away from doing right and does evil things , he will die . He will die because of the evil things he has done .
‘ » When a wicked person turns away from the wicked things that he has done and does what is fair and right , he will live .
‘ » He realized what he was doing and turned away from all the rebellious things that he had done . He will certainly live . He will not die .
‘ » But the nation of Israel says : Jehovah’s way is unfair . Is my way not fair , nation of Israel ? Is it not your ways that are unfair ?
‘ » That is why I will judge each of you by what you have done , people of Israel , declares the Lord Jehovah . Change the way you think and act . Repent ! Turn away from all the rebellious things that you have done so that you will not fall into sin .
‘ » Give up all the evil you have been doing . Get yourselves new minds and hearts . Why do you Israelites want to die ?
‘ » I do not want anyone to die , ’ ’ says the Lord Jehovah . ‘ Turn away from repent of your sins and live . ’ «
» Take up a song of grief concerning the princes of Israel .
» Say : ‘ What a lioness was your mother among the lions ! She lay down among the young lions and reared her cubs .
‘ » She brought up one of her cubs , and he became a strong lion . He learned to tear the prey and he devoured men .
The nations heard about him . He was trapped in their pit . They led him with hooks to the land of Egypt .
‘ » When she saw her hope unfulfilled , her expectation gone , she took another of her cubs and made him a strong lion .
‘ » He prowled among the lions , for he was now a strong lion . He learned to tear the prey and he devoured men .
‘ » He broke down their strongholds and devastated their towns . His roaring terrified the residents of the land .
‘ » Then the nations came against him , those from regions round about . They spread their net for him , and he was trapped in their pit .
‘ » With hooks they pulled him into a cage and brought him to the king of Babylon . They put him in prison . Therefore his roar was heard no longer on the mountains of Israel .
‘ » Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard planted by the water . It was fruitful and full of branches because of abundant water .
‘ » Its branches were strong and fit for a ruler’s scepter . It towered high above the thick foliage , conspicuous for its height and for its many branches .
‘ » It was uprooted in fury and thrown to the ground . The east wind made it shrivel . It was stripped of its fruit . Its strong branches withered and fire consumed them .
‘ » Now it is planted in the desert , in a dry and thirsty land .
‘ » Fire spread from one of its main branches and consumed its fruit . No strong branch is left on it fit for a ruler’s scepter . This is a song of grief and is to be used as a song of grief . ’ «
Seven years after King Jehoiachin and the rest of us had been led away as prisoners to Babylon , some of Israel's leaders came to me on the tenth day of the fifth month . They sat down and asked for a message from Jehovah .
Just then , Jehovah said :
» Son of man , these elders have come to find out what I want them to do . As surely as I live , I will not give them an answer of any kind .
» Are you willing to warn them , Ezekiel ? Then remind them of the disgusting sins of their ancestors .
» Tell them what the Lord Jehovah said : ‘ When I chose Israel , I made them a promise . I revealed myself to them in Egypt and told them : ‘ I am Jehovah your God . ’
» It was then that I promised to take them out of Egypt and lead them to a land I had chosen for them , a rich and fertile land , the finest land of all .
» I told them to throw away the disgusting idols they loved and not to make themselves unclean with the false gods of Egypt . I am Jehovah their God .
‘ » » They defied me and refused to listen . They did not throw away their disgusting idols or give up the Egyptian gods . I was ready to let them feel the full force of my anger there in Egypt .
» ‘ » But I did not , since that would have brought dishonor to my name . In the presence of the people among whom they were living I had announced to Israel that I was going to lead them out of Egypt .
‘ » » So I led them out of Egypt into the desert .
‘ » » I gave them my laws and made my rules known to them . If people obey them they will live .
‘ » » I also gave them certain days to worship me as a sign between us so that they would know that I , Jehovah , made them holy .
‘ » » But the people of Israel rebelled against me in the desert . They did not live by my laws . They rejected my rules . If people obey them , they will live . They dishonored the days to worship me . So I was going to pour out my fury on them in the desert and completely wipe them out .
‘ » » I acted so that my name would not be dishonored among the nations who had watched me bring the Israelites out of Egypt .
‘ » » I also swore an oath to them in the desert . I swore that I would not bring them into the land that I had promised to give them . This land is the most beautiful land , a land flowing with milk and honey .
‘ » » They rejected my rules . They did not live by my laws . They dishonored the days to worship me , because their hearts chased disgusting idols .
‘ » » But I had compassion on them . I did not destroy them or completely wipe them out in the desert .
‘ » » I said to their children in the desert : Do not live by the laws of your ancestors . Do not obey their rules or dishonor yourselves with their disgusting idols .
‘ » » I am Jehovah your God ! Walk in my statutes and obey my ordinances .
‘ » » Sanctify my Sabbaths . They shall be a sign between you , and me that you may know that I am Jehovah your God . ’
‘ » » But the children rebelled against me . They did not walk in my statutes . They were not careful to obey my ordinances . If a man obeys them , he will live . They profaned my Sabbaths . So I resolved to pour out my wrath on them , to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness .
‘ » » But I withdrew my hand assistance and acted for the sake of my name . That way it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out .
» I swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them among the lands .
» I did this because they had rejected my commands , broken my laws , profaned the Sabbath , and worshiped the same idols their ancestors had served .
» Then I gave them laws that are not good and commandments that do not bring life .
» I let them defile themselves with their own offerings , and I let them sacrifice their first-born sons . This was to punish them and show them that I am Jehovah . « ’
» Now then , son of man , tell the Israelites what I , the Lord Jehovah , am saying to them . This is another way their ancestors insulted me by their unfaithfulness .
» I brought them to the land I had promised to give them . When they saw the high hills and green trees , they offered sacrifices at all of them . They made me angry by the sacrifices they burned and by the wine they brought as offerings .
» Then I asked them : ‘ What is this worship site you are going to ? So it is still called a worship site today . ’ «
» Tell the nation of Israel : ‘ This is what the Lord Jehovah says : » Will you dishonor yourselves the way your ancestors did ? Will you chase their detestable idols like a prostitute ?
‘ » You offer your children as sacrifices by burning them alive . You dishonor yourselves with all your disgusting idols to this day . Should you be allowed to ask me for help , nation of Israel ? As I am alive , declares the Lord Jehovah , you will not be allowed to ask me for help . « ’
‘ » What you have in mind heart will never happen . You think that you want to be like other nations , like the different people in other countries . You want to serve wood and stone . « ’
‘ » As I am alive , ’ ’ declares the Lord Jehovah , ‘ I will rule you with a mighty hand and a powerful arm . I will pour out my fury .
‘ » I will bring you out from the nations and gather you from the countries where I have scattered you with my mighty hand and powerful arm . I will pour out my fury .
‘ » I will bring you into the wilderness of the nations . There I will put you on trial face to face .
I will now condemn you just as I condemned your ancestors in the Sinai Desert , ’ ’ says the Lord Jehovah .
‘ I will take firm control of you and make you obey my covenant .
‘ I will take away from among you those who are rebellious and sinful . I will take them out of the lands where they are living now , but I will not let them return to the land of Israel . Then you will know that I am Jehovah . ’
» The Lord Jehovah says : ‘ The Lord Jehovah tells all you Israelites to suit yourselves ! Go on and serve your idols ! But I warn you that after this you will have to obey me and stop dishonoring my holy name by offering gifts to your idols . ’
» There in the land , on my holy mountain , the high mountain of Israel , all you people of Israel will worship me . I will be pleased with you and will expect you to bring me your sacrifices , your best offerings , and your holy gifts .
‘ After I bring you out of the countries where you have been scattered and gather you together , I will accept the sacrifices that you burn , and the nations will see that I am holy . ’
‘ » When I bring you back to Israel , the land that I promised I would give to your ancestors , you will know that I am Jehovah .
‘ » There you will remember the way you lived and everything you did to dishonor yourselves . You will be disgusted by every wrong thing that you did .
’ » You will know that I am Jehovah , because I will deal with you for the sake of my name . I will not deal with you based on the evil and corrupt things that you have done , O nation of Israel , declares the Lord Jehovah !
Jehovah spoke his word to me , He said :
» Son of man , turn to the south , preach against the south , and prophesy against the forest in the Negev .
» Tell the forest in the Negev : ‘ Listen to the word of Jehovah . This is what the Lord Jehovah says : » I am about to set fire to you to destroy all your green trees and all your dry trees . The blazing fire will not be put out . It will burn the whole land from the south to the north .
» Then everyone will know that I , Jehovah , started the fire . It will never be put out . « ’ «
Then I said : Oh no ! Lord Jehovah , no ! The people already say that I am only telling stories a figure of speech or a parable .
Jehovah continued to speak his word to me :
» Son of man , turn to Jerusalem and preach against the holy places . Prophesy against the land of Israel .
» Tell the land of Israel : ‘ This is what Jehovah says : » I am against you . I will take my sword out of its sheath and kill the righteous people and the wicked people among you .
‘ » I am going to kill the righteous people and the wicked people among you . That is why my sword will come out of its sheath to be used against everyone from the south to the north .
‘ » Then everyone will know that I , Jehovah , have taken my sword from its sheath , and I will not put it back again . « ’
» So , son of man , groan with a breaking heart and with bitter crying while the people watch you .
» When they ask why you are groaning tell this : ‘ News has come that will discourage everyone . People's hands will hang limp , their hearts will lose courage , and their knees will become as weak as water . It is coming ! It will surely take place ! ’ ’ Declares the Lord Jehovah . «
Jehovah continued to speak to Ezekiel :
» Son of man , prophecy and say , ‘ this is what Jehovah says : » A sword , a sword is sharpened and also polished !
‘ » ‘ It is sharpened to make a slaughter and polished to flash like lightning ! Shall we rejoice in the rod of my son despising every tree ? ’ « ’ «
‘ » The sword was given to be polished , that it might be handled . The sword is sharpened and polished , to give it into the hand of the slayer .
‘ » Cry out and wail , son of man , for it is against my people ; it is against all the officials of Israel . They are delivered over to the sword with my people . Therefore strike your thigh .
‘ » For there is testing . And what if even the rod that despises will be no more ? « Declares the Lord Jehovah .
» You therefore , son of man , prophesy and clap your hands together . Let the sword be doubled the third time , the sword for the slain . It is the sword for the great one slain , which surrounds them ,
that their hearts may melt lose their courage , and many fall at all their gates . I have given the glittering sword . Ah ! It is made for striking like lightning . It is wrapped up in readiness for slaughter .
» Show yourself sharp , go to the right , set yourself , go to the left , wherever your edge is appointed .
» Clap your hands and I will bring my anger to rest . Jehovah has spoken . «
Jehovah’s word came to me :
» Son of man , mark two roads that the king of Babylon and his sword can take . Both of these roads should start from the same country . Make a signpost and put it at the fork of the roads that go toward the cities .
» Mark the road that the king and his sword can take to the Ammonite city of Rabbah . Then mark the road that leads to Judah and the fortified city of Jerusalem .
» The king of Babylon will stand where the roads branch off , at the fork in the road . Then he will look for omens . The king will stand at the branch of the roads where he will use divination . He will shake the arrows and ask the teraphim and look into the liver .
» The divination omens will indicate that he should go to the right , to Jerusalem . So he will set up his battering rams there , and give the order to kill . He will raise a battle cry and aim the battering rams against the city gates . He will put up ramps and set up blockades siege walls .
» The people will think it is false divination and not believe this because they have made treaties with other nations . But the king of Babylon will remind them of their sins , and they will be captured .
» This is what the Lord Jehovah says : ‘ People remember how sinful you are because you openly do wrong . You show your sins in everything you do . Because of this you will be taken captive .
» You dishonest and wicked prince of Israel , the time for your final punishment has come .
» I , the Lord Jehovah , have spoken . Take off your crown and your turban . Nothing will be the same again . Raise the poor to power ! Bring down those who are ruling ! Bring low the high one .
» A ruin , a ruin , a ruin ! Yes , I will make the city a ruin . But this will not happen until the one comes whom I have chosen and who has the legal right to punish the city . To him I will give it .
» O son of man , prophesy . Announce what I , the Lord Jehovah , am saying to the Ammonites , who are insulting Israel . Say to them : A sword is ready to destroy . It is polished to kill and to flash like lightning .
» The visions that you see are false . The predictions you make are lies . You are wicked and evil . Your day is coming , the day of your final punishment . The sword is going to fall on your necks .
» Put up the sword return it to its sheath ! I will judge you in the place where you were created , in the land where you were born .
» You will feel my anger when I turn it loose on you like a blazing fire . And I will hand you over to brutal men , experts at destruction .
» You will be destroyed by fire . Your blood will be shed in your own country . No one will remember you any more . Jehovah has spoken ! ’ «
Jehovah continued to speak his word to me :
Son of man will you judge ? Will you judge the city of murderers the bloodguilty ? Then tell it about all the disgusting things that it has done .
» Tell it : ‘ This is what the Lord Jehovah says : » Jerusalem , you are the city that murders people who live in you . Your time has come . You dishonor yourself with disgusting idols .
» ‘ » You are guilty because of the blood you have shed people you have killed . You are unclean dishonored because of the disgusting idols you have made . You have brought an end to your days , and you have come to the end of your years . That is why I will make you a disgrace to the nations and a joke in every land .
» ‘ » Those near and those far away will mock you . Your name will be dishonored , and you will be filled with confusion .
» ‘ » See how all the princes of Israel who live in you have used their power to shed blood murder people .
» ‘ » People in you hate their fathers and mothers . They oppress foreigners in you . They oppress orphans and widows in you . « ’ «
» You have despised my holy things and dishonored profaned the Sabbath the day to worship me .
» Your people tell lies about others in order to have them put to death . They eat sacrifices offered to idols . They always satisfy their lusts .
» Some of them sleep with their father's wife . Some force women to have intercourse with them during their period .
» Some commit adultery , and others seduce their daughters-in-law or their half sisters .
» Some of your people murder for pay . Some charge interest on the loans they make to other Israelites and get rich by taking advantage of them . They have forgotten me . The Lord Jehovah has spoken .
‘ » I strike my fist at your dishonest gain and your acts of bloodshed .
‘ » Can your heart endure ? Will your hands be strong in the days that I will deal with you ? I , Jehovah , have spoken and will act .
‘ » I will scatter you among the nations and I will disperse you through the lands , and I will consume your uncleanness from you .
‘ » You will profane yourself in the sight of the nations , and you will know that I am Jehovah . « ’
Jehovah’s word came to me , He said :
» Son of man , the house of Israel has become dross to me . All of them are the copper , tin , iron and lead in the furnace . They are the dross of silver .
» Therefore , the Lord Jehovah says : ‘ I am going to gather you into Jerusalem . This is because all of you have become dross impure worthless .
‘ » As they gather silver and copper and iron and lead and tin into the furnace to blow fire on it in order to melt it , so I will gather you in my anger and in my wrath and I will lay you there and melt liquefy you .
‘ » I will gather you and blow on you with the fire of my wrath . You will be melted in the midst of it .
‘ » As silver is melted in the furnace , you will be melted in the midst of her . You will know that I , Jehovah , have poured out my wrath on you . « ’
Jehovah continued to speak his word to me , He said :
» Son of man , say to her : ‘ You are a land that is not cleansed or rained on in the day of indignation outrage revulsion .
‘ » There is a conspiracy of her prophets in her midst like a roaring lion tearing the prey . They have devoured lives . They have taken treasure and precious things . They have made many widows in the midst of her .
‘ » Her priests have done violence to my law and have profaned my holy things . They have made no distinction between the holy and the profane . They have not taught the difference between the unclean and the clean . They hide their eyes from my Sabbaths , and I am profaned among them .
‘ » Her princes within her are like wolves tearing the prey , by shedding blood and destroying lives in order to get dishonest gain .
‘ » Her prophets have smeared whitewash for them . They see false visions and divine lies for them . They say : » This is what the Lord Jehovah says , when Jehovah has not spoken . «
‘ » The people of the land have practiced oppression and committed robbery . They have wronged the poor and needy and have oppressed the sojourner without justice . ’
‘ » I searched for a man among them who would build up the wall and stand in the gap before me on behalf of the land , so that I would not destroy it ; but I found no one .
‘ » Therefore I have poured out my indignation on them ! I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath intense anger . Their way I have brought upon their heads , ’ ’ declares the Lord Jehovah . «
Jehovah spoke his word to me again :
» Son of man , there were two women , the daughters of one mother .
» They played the prostitute in Egypt . They played the prostitute in their youth . There their breasts were pressed and there their virgin bosom was handled .
» Their names were Oholah the elder and Oholibah her sister . They became mine , and they bore sons and daughters . As for their names , Samaria is Oholah and Jerusalem is Oholibah .
» Oholah played the prostitute while she was mine ; and she lusted after her lovers , after the Assyrians , her neighbors .
» The Assyrians were clothed in purple , governors and officials , all of them desirable young men , horsemen riding on horses .
» She gave her acts of fornication to them , all of whom were the choicest men of Assyria ; and with all whom she lusted after , with all their idols she defiled herself .
» She did not forsake her acts of fornication from the time in Egypt . In her youth men had lain with her . They handled her virgin bosom and poured out their lust on her .
» Therefore , I gave her into the hand of her lovers , into the hand of the Assyrians , after whom she lusted .
» They uncovered her nakedness . They took her sons and her daughters , but they killed her with the sword . Thus she became a byword among women , and they executed judgments on her .
» Now her sister Oholibah saw this , yet she was more corrupt in her lust than she . Her prostitution was more than the fornication of her sister .
» She lusted after the Assyrians , governors and officials , the ones near , magnificently dressed , horsemen riding on horses , all of them desirable young men .
» I saw that she had defiled herself and that they both went the same way .
» So she increased her acts of fornication . And she saw men portrayed on the wall , images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion reddish-orange color ,
girded with belts on their loins , with flowing turbans on their heads , all of them looking like officers , like the Babylonians in Chaldea , the land of their birth .
» When she saw them she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea .
» The Babylonians came to her , to the bed of love , and defiled her with their acts of prostitution . When they had defiled her , she became disgusted with them .
» She uncovered her acts if prostitution and uncovered her nakedness . I became disgusted with her , as I had become disgusted with her sister .
» Yet she multiplied her acts of prostitution . She remembered the days of her youth , when she prostituted herself in the land of Egypt .
» She lusted after their paramours , whose flesh is like the flesh of donkeys and whose genital organ is like the genital organ of horses .
» Thus you longed for the lewdness of your youth , when the Egyptians handled your bosom because of the breasts of your youth .
» Therefore , O Oholibah , the Lord Jehovah says : ‘ Behold I will arouse your lovers against you , from whom you were alienated . I will bring them against you from every side :
the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans , Pekod and Shoa and Koa , and all the Assyrians with them , desirable young men , governors and officials all of them , officers and men of renown , all of them riding on horses .
‘ » They will come against you with weapons , chariots and wagons , and with a company of peoples . They will set themselves against you on every side with buckler and shield and helmet . I will commit the judgment to them , and they will judge you according to their customs .
‘ » I will set my jealousy against you , that they may deal with you in wrath . They will remove your nose and your ears . Your survivors will fall by the sword . They will take your sons and your daughters . The fire will consume your survivors .
‘ » They will also strip you of your clothes and take away your beautiful jewels .
‘ » I will make your lewdness and your fornication brought from the land of Egypt to cease from you , so that you will not lift up your eyes to them or remember Egypt anymore . ’
» The Lord Jehovah says : ‘ Behold , I will give you into the hand of those whom you hate , into the hand of those from whom you were alienated .
» They will deal with you in hatred , take all your property , and leave you naked and bare . And the nakedness of your fornications will be uncovered , both your lewdness and your acts of prostitution .
» These things will be done to you because you have played the prostitute with the nations , because you have defiled yourself with their idols .
» You have walked in the way of your sister . Therefore I will give her cup into your hand .
» The Lord Jehovah says this : ‘ You will drink your sister's cup , which is deep and wide . You will be laughed at and held in derision ; it contains much .
‘ » You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow , the cup of horror and desolation , the cup of your sister Samaria .
‘ » You will drink it and drain it . Then you will gnaw its fragments and tear your breasts . » I have spoken , « declares the Lord Jehovah . ’
» Therefore , the Lord Jehovah says : ‘ Because you have forgotten me and cast me behind your back , bear now the punishment of your lewdness and your acts of prostitution . ’ «
Jehovah said to me : » Son of man , will you judge Oholah and Oholibah ? Then declare to them their abominations .
» For they have committed adultery , and blood is on their hands . Thus they have committed adultery with their idols and even caused their sons , whom they bore to me , to pass through the fire to them as food .
» Again , they have done this to me : they have defiled my sanctuary on the same day and have profaned my Sabbaths .
» For when they had slaughtered their children for their idols , they entered my sanctuary on the same day to profane it . Then they did within my house .
» Furthermore , they have even sent for men who come from afar , to whom a messenger was sent . They came and you bathed , painted your eyes and decorated yourselves with ornaments for them .
» You sat on a splendid couch with a table arranged before it on which you had set my incense and my oil .
» The sound of a carefree multitude was with her . Drunkards were brought from the wilderness with men of the common sort . And they put bracelets on the hands of the women and beautiful crowns on their heads .
» Then I said concerning her who was worn out by adultery : » Will they now commit adultery with her when she is thus ?
» But they went into her as they would go into a prostitute . Thus they went into Oholah and into Oholibah , the lewd women .
» But they , righteous men , will judge them with the judgment of adulteresses and with the judgment of women who shed blood , because they are adulteresses and blood is on their hands .
» The Lord Jehovah says : ‘ Bring up a company against them and give them over to terror and plunder .
‘ » The company will stone them with stones and cut them down with their swords . They will slay their sons and their daughters and burn their houses with fire .
’ » Thus I will make lewdness cease from the land . All women will be admonished and not commit lewdness as you have done .
‘ » Your lewdness will be repaid upon you . You will bear the penalty of worshiping your idols . You will know that I am the Lord Jehovah ! ’ «
The word of Jehovah came to me in the ninth year , in the tenth month , on the tenth of the month , He said :
» Son of man , write the name of the day , this very day . The king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day .
» Speak a parable to the rebellious house . Say to them : The Lord Jehovah says , » Put on the cooking pot , put it on and also pour water in it .
» Put in it the pieces , every good piece , the thigh and the shoulder . Fill it with choice bones .
» Take the choicest of the flock . Also pile wood under the pot . Make it boil vigorously . Also boil its bones in it . « ’ «
» Therefore , the Lord Jehovah says : ‘ Woe to the bloody city , To the cooking pot in which there is rust and whose rust has not gone out of it ! Take out of it piece after piece , without making a choice .
» » Her blood is in her midst . She placed it on the bare rock . She did not pour it on the ground to cover it with dust .
‘ » That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance , I have put her blood on the bare rock , that it may not be covered . ’
» The Lord Jehovah says : ‘ Woe to the bloody city ! I also will make the pile great .
‘ » Heap on the wood and kindle the fire . Boil the flesh well and mix in the spices and let the bones be burned .
‘ » Then set it empty on its coals so that it may be hot and its copper may glow and its filthiness may be melted in it . Let its rust be consumed .
‘ » She has made me tire with toil , yet her great rust has not gone from her . Let her rust be in the fire ! ’
‘ » In your filthiness is lewdness . Because I would have cleansed you , yet you are not clean . You will not be cleansed from your filthiness again until I have spent my anger on you .
‘ » I , Jehovah , have spoken . It is coming and I will act . I will not relent , and I will not pity and I will not be sorry ! I will judge you according to your ways and according to your deeds . ’ ’ This is a declaration of the Lord Jehovah . «
Jehovah continued to speak his word to me :
» Son of man , behold , I am about to take from you the desire of your eyes with a blow . You will , however , not mourn and you will not weep , and your tears will not come .
» Groan silently ; make no mourning for the dead . Bind on your turban and put your shoes on your feet . Do not cover your mustache and do not eat the bread of men . «
» So I spoke to the people in the morning , and in the evening my wife died . And in the morning I did as I was commanded .
» The people said to me : » Will you not tell us what these things that you are doing mean for us ? «
Then I said to them : » The word of Jehovah came to me , and He said :
» Speak to the house of Israel . Tell them Jehovah says : ‘ I am about to profane my sanctuary , the pride of your power , the desire of your eyes and your delight . Your sons and your daughters whom you have left behind will fall by the sword .
‘ » You will do as I have done . You will not cover your mustache and you will not eat the bread of men .
‘ « ’ Your turbans will be on your heads and your shoes on your feet . You will not mourn and you will not weep . You will rot away in your iniquities and you will groan to one another .
‘ » ‘ So Ezekiel will be a sign to you . You will do according to all that he has done . Then you will know that I am the Lord Jehovah . ’ « ’
» As for you , O son of man , will it not be on the day when I take from them their stronghold , the joy of their pride , the desire of their eyes and their heart's delight , their sons and their daughters ,
that on that day he who escapes will come to you with information for your ears ?
» On that day your mouth will be opened to him who escaped . You will speak and be mute no longer . So you will be a sign to them , and they will know that I am Jehovah . «
Jehovah continued to speak his word to me :
» Son of man set your face give attention toward the Ammonites and prophesy against them .
» Tell the Ammonites : ‘ Hear the word of the Lord Jehovah ! The Lord Jehovah says : » Because you said , Aha ! Against My sanctuary when it was profaned , and against the land of Israel when it was made desolate , and against the house of Judah when they went into exile ,
» ‘ » I am going to give you to the sons of the east for a possession . They will set their encampments among you and make their dwellings among you . They will eat your fruit and drink your milk .
» ‘ » I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels and the Ammonites a resting place for flocks . So you will know that I am Jehovah . « ’ «
» The Lord Jehovah says : ‘ Because you have clapped your hands and stamped your feet and rejoiced in your scorn against the land of Israel ,
‘ » I have stretched out my hand against you and I will give you for spoil to the nations . I will cut you off from the peoples and make you perish from the lands . I will destroy you . Therefore , you will know that I am Jehovah . ’
» The Lord Jehovah says : ‘ Because Moab and Seir say , » Behold , the house of Judah is like all the nations ,
therefore , I am going to deprive the flank of Moab of its cities , of its cities which are on its frontiers , the glory of the land , Beth-jeshimoth , Baal-meon and Kiriathaim ,
and I will give it for a possession along with the Ammonites to the sons of the east , so that the Ammonites will not be remembered among the nations .
» ‘ » Thus I will execute judgments on Moab , and they will know that I am Jehovah . ’
» The Lord Jehovah says : ‘ Because Edom has acted against the house of Judah by taking vengeance , and has incurred grievous guilt , and avenged themselves upon them ,
therefore the Lord Jehovah says : ‘ I will also stretch out my hand exert my power against Edom and cut off man and beast from it . I will lay it waste ! From Teman even to Dedan they will fall by the sword .
‘ I will lay my vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel . Therefore , they will act in Edom according to my anger and according to my wrath . They will know my vengeance , declares the Lord Jehovah . « ’
» The Lord Jehovah says : Because the Philistines have acted in revenge and scorn and have taken vengeance to destroy with everlasting enmity ,
therefore the Lord Jehovah says : ‘ I will stretch out my hand exert power against the Philistines . I will even cut off the Cherethites and destroy the remnant of the seacoast .
» ‘ » I will execute great vengeance on them with wrathful rebukes . They will know that I am Jehovah when I lay my vengeance on them . « ’ «
Now in the eleventh year , on the first of the month , the word of Jehovah came to me :
» Son of man , because Tyre has said concerning Jerusalem , ‘ Aha , the gateway of the peoples is broken ; it has opened to me . I will be filled , now that she is laid waste . ’
» Therefore the Lord Jehovah says : ‘ I am against you , O Tyre , and I will bring up many nations against you , as the sea brings up its waves .
» ‘ They will destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers . I will scrape her debris from her and make her a bare rock .
» ‘ She will be a place for the spreading of nets in the middle of the sea . I have spoken , declares the Lord Jehovah . She will become spoil for the nations . ’
» ‘ Her daughters on the mainland will be killed by the sword . They will know that I am Jehovah . ’
» The Lord Jehovah says : ‘ I will bring upon Tyre from the north Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon . He is king of kings . He has many horses , chariots , cavalry and a great army .
‘ » He will slay your daughters on the mainland with the sword . He will make siege walls against you , cast up a ramp against you and raise up a large shield against you .
» ‘ He will direct the blow of his battering rams against your walls . He will break down your towers with his axes .
» ‘ Dust raised by the vast number of his horses will cover you . The noise of cavalry , wagons and chariots will shake your walls . He will enter your gates as men enter a city that is breached .
» ‘ The hoofs of his horses will trample all your streets . He will slay your people with the sword and your strong pillars will come down to the ground .
» ‘ They will make a spoil of your riches and a prey of your merchandise . They will break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses . They will throw your stones and your timbers and your debris into the water . ’
» ‘ So I will silence the sound of your songs , and the sound of your harps will be heard no more .
» ‘ I will make you a bare rock . You will be a place for the spreading of nets . You will be built no more , for I Jehovah have spoken , ’ ’ declares the Lord Jehovah .
» The Lord Jehovah says to Tyre : ‘ Will not the coastlands shake at the sound of your fall when the wounded groan , when the slaughter occurs in your midst ?
‘ » Then all the princes of the sea will go down from their thrones and remove their robes and strip off their embroidered garments . They will clothe themselves with trembling . They will sit on the ground , tremble every moment and be appalled at you .
‘ » They will take up a lamentation over you and say to you : » ‘ » How you have perished , O inhabited one , from the seas , O renowned city . You were mighty on the sea . She and her inhabitants imposed her terror on all her inhabitants !
» ‘ » Now the coastlands will tremble on the day of your fall . Yes , the coastlands by the sea will be terrified at your passing . « ’
» The Lord Jehovah says : ‘ When I make you a desolate city , like the cities that are not inhabited , when I bring up the deep over you and the great waters cover you ,
then I will bring you down with those who go down to the pit grave , to the people of old , and I will make you dwell in the lower parts of the earth . It will be like the ancient waste places , with those who go down to the pit grave , so that you will not be inhabited ; but I will set glory in the land of the living .
» I will bring terrors on you and you will be no more . Though you will be sought , you will never be found again , ’ ’ declares the Lord Jehovah . «
Jehovah’s word continued to come to me :
» You , son of man , take up a lamentation over Tyre .
Say to Tyre , who dwells at the entrance to the sea , merchant of the peoples to many coastlands , thus says the Lord Jehovah : » ‘ O Tyre , you have said , ‘ I am perfect in beauty . ’
» Your borders are in the heart of the seas . Your builders have perfected your beauty .
» They have made all your planks of fir trees from Senir . They have taken a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you .
» Of oaks from Bashan they have made your oars . With ivory they have inlaid your deck with cypress wood from the coastlands of Cyprus .
» Your sail was of fine embroidered linen from Egypt . It became your distinguishing mark . Your awning was blue and purple from the coastlands of Elishah .
» ‘ » The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your rowers . Your wise men , O Tyre , were aboard . They were your pilots .
» ‘ » The elders of Gebal and her wise men were with you repairing your seams . All the ships of the sea and their sailors were with you in order to deal in your merchandise .
» ‘ » Persia and Lud and Put were in your army , your men of war . They hung shield and helmet in you . They set forth your splendor .
» ‘ » People from Arvad and Helech were tower guards all around your walls . They made your beauty perfect .
People from Tarshish traded with you because you were so very rich . They exchanged silver , iron , tin , and lead for your merchandise .
» ‘ » Japan , Tubal and Meshech were your traders . They paid for your merchandise with the lives of men and vessels of bronze .
» ‘ » Those from Beth-togarmah gave horses and warhorses and mules for your wares .
» ‘ » The sons of Dedan were your traders . Many coastlands were your market ; ivory tusks and ebony they brought as your payment .
» ‘ » Aram was your customer because of the abundance of your goods . They paid for your wares with emeralds , purple , embroidered work , fine linen , coral and rubies .
» ‘ » Judah and the land of Israel were your traders . They traded with the wheat of Minnith . Cakes , honey , oil and balm were paid for your merchandise .
» ‘ » Damascus was your customer because of the abundance of your goods , because of the abundance of all kinds of wealth , because of the wine of Helbon and white wool .
» ‘ » Vedan and Javan paid for your wares from Uzal . Wrought iron , cassia and sweet cane were among your merchandise .
» ‘ » Dedan traded with you in saddlecloths for riding .
» ‘ » Arabia and all the princes of Kedar were your customers for lambs , rams and goats .
» ‘ » The traders of Sheba and Raamah traded with you . They paid for your wares with the best of all kinds of spices , and with all kinds of precious stones and gold .
» ‘ » Haran , Canneh , Eden , the traders of Sheba , Asshur and Chilmad traded with you .
» ‘ » They traded with you in choice garments , in clothes of blue and embroidered work , and in carpets of many colors and tightly wound cords , which were among your merchandise .
» ‘ » The ships of Tarshish were the carriers for your merchandise . And you were filled and were very glorious in the heart of the seas .
» ‘ » Your rowers have brought you into great waters . The east wind has broken you in the heart of the seas .
» ‘ » Your wealth , your wares , your merchandise , your sailors and your pilots , your repairers of seams , your dealers in merchandise and all your men of war who are in you , with all your company that is in your midst , will fall into the heart of the seas on the day of your overthrow .
» ‘ » The pasturelands will shake at the sound of the cry of your pilots .
» ‘ » All who handle the oars , the sailors and all the pilots of the sea will come down from their ships . They will stand on the land ,
» ‘ » And they will make their voice heard over you and will cry bitterly . They will cast dust on their heads and wallow in ashes .
» ‘ » They will make themselves bald for you and gird themselves with sackcloth . They will weep for you in bitterness and with painful mourning .
» ‘ » In their wailing they will take up a lamentation for you and lament over you : Who is like Tyre , Like her who is silent in the midst of the sea ?
» ‘ » When your wares went out from the seas , you satisfied many peoples . With the abundance of your wealth and your merchandise you enriched the kings of earth .
» ‘ » In the very depths of the waters , you are broken by the sea . Your merchandise and all your company have fallen in the midst of you .
» ‘ » All the inhabitants of the coastlands are appalled at you . Their kings are horribly afraid . They are troubled in countenance .
» ‘ » The merchants among the peoples hiss at you . You have become terrified and you will cease to be forever . « ’ «
Jehovah continued to speak to me :
» Son of man , tell the ruler of Tyre : ‘ This is what the Lord Jehovah says : » ‘ » In your arrogance you say , ‘ I am a god strong deity . I sit on God's throne in the sea . ’ ’ But you are only human and not a god , although you think you are a god .
‘ » You think that you are wiser than Daniel and that no secret can be hidden from you .
‘ » Because you are wise and understanding , you have made yourself rich . You saved gold and silver in your treasuries .
‘ » Because of your great skill in trading , you have made yourself very wealthy . You have become arrogant because of your wealth . ’ «
‘ » Therefore the Lord Jehovah says : Because you have made your heart like consider yourself to be like the heart of God ,
‘ » I will bring strangers , ruthless nations , upon you . They will draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom and defile your splendor .
‘ » They will throw you into a pit . You will die a violent death in the sea .
‘ » You will no longer say that you are a god when you face those who kill you . You will be a human , not a god , in the hands of those who kill you . « ’
‘ » You will die at the hands of foreigners like a godless person . ’ ’ I have spoken , declares Jehovah . «
Jehovah continued to speak his word to me :
» Son of man , sing a funeral song for the ruler of Tyre . Tell him : ‘ This is what the Lord Jehovah says : » ‘ » You were the perfect example , full of wisdom and perfect in beauty .
» ‘ » You were in Eden , God's garden . You were covered with every kind of precious stone : red quartz , topaz , crystal , beryl , jade , onyx , gray quartz , sapphire , turquoise , and emerald . Your settings and your sockets were made of gold when you were created .
» ‘ » I appointed an angel to guard you . You were on God's holy mountain . You walked among fiery stones .
» ‘ » Your behavior was perfect from the time you were created , until evil was found in you .
» ‘ » By the abundance of your trade you were filled with violence , and you sinned . Therefore I have cast you as profane from the mountain of God . I have destroyed you , O covering cherub , from the midst of the stones of fire .
» ‘ » Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty . You corrupted your wisdom by reason of your splendor . I cast you to the ground . I put you before kings , that they may see you .
» ‘ » By the multitude of your iniquities , in the unrighteousness of your trade you profaned your sanctuaries . Therefore I have brought fire from the midst of you . It has consumed you . I have turned you to ashes on the earth in the eyes of all who see you .
» ‘ » All who know you among the peoples are appalled at you . You have become terrified . You will cease to be forever . « ’ «
The word of Jehovah came to me , He said :
» Son of man , set your face pay attention toward Sidon , prophesy against her .
» You must say , , The Lord Jehovah says : » I am against you , O Sidon ! I will be glorified in your midst . Then they will know that I am Jehovah when I execute judgments in her . I will manifest my holiness in her .
» ‘ For I will send pestilence to her and blood to her streets . The wounded will fall in her midst by the sword upon her on every side . Then they will know that I am Jehovah .
» ‘ There will be no more prickling brier or a painful thorn for the house of Israel from any round about them who scorned them . Then they will know that I am the Lord Jehovah .
» ‘ The Lord Jehovah says : » When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered , I will make known my holiness in them in the sight of the nations . Then they will live in their land that I gave to my servant Jacob .
» ‘ » They will live in it securely . They will build houses , plant vineyards and live securely when I execute judgments upon all who scorn them round about them . Then they will know that I am Jehovah their God ! « ’ «
In the tenth year , in the tenth month , on the twelfth of the month , the word of Jehovah came to me :
» Son of man set your face present yourself against Pharaoh king of Egypt and prophesy against him and against all Egypt .
» Say this , ‘ The Lord Jehovah says : » I am against you Pharaoh , king of Egypt , the great monster Egypt that lies in the midst of his rivers . You have said : ‘ My Nile is mine ! I have made it ! ’ «
» I will put hooks in your jaws and make the fish of your rivers cling to your scales . I will bring you up out of the midst of your rivers . All the fish of your rivers will cling to your scales .
» I will abandon you to the wilderness and all the fish of your rivers . You will fall on the open field . You will not be brought together or gathered . I have given you for food to the beasts of the earth and to the birds of the sky .
» Then all the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am Jehovah . This is because they have been only a staff made of reed to the house of Israel .
» When they took hold of you with the hand , you broke and tore all their hands . When they leaned on you , you broke and made all their loins quake . «
» ‘ Therefore the Lord Jehovah says : » I will bring upon you a sword and I will cut off from you man and beast .
» ‘ The land of Egypt will become a desolation and waste . Then they will know that I am Jehovah . Because you said : ‘ The Nile is mine , and I have made it . ’
» I am against you and against your rivers . I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation , from Migdol to Syene and even to the border of Ethiopia .
» A man's foot will not pass through it , and the foot of a beast will not pass through it , and it will not be inhabited for forty years .
» So I will make the land of Egypt desolation in the midst of desolated lands . And her cities , in the midst of cities that are laid waste , will be desolate forty years . I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands . «
» ‘ The Lord Jehovah says : » At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples among whom they were scattered .
» » ‘ I will turn the fortunes of Egypt and make them return to the land of Pathros , to the land of their origin . They will be a lowly kingdom .
» » ‘ It will be the lowest of the kingdoms , and it will never again lift itself up above the nations . I will make them so small that they will not rule over the nations .
» ‘ » It will never again be the confidence of the house of Israel , bringing to mind the iniquity of their having turned to Egypt . Then they will know that I am the Lord Jehovah . « ’ «
Now in the twenty-seventh year , in the first month , on the first of the month , the word of Jehovah came to me . He said :
» Son of man , Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made his army labor hard against Tyre . Every head was made bald and every shoulder was rubbed bare . But he and his army had no wages from Tyre for the labor that he had performed against it .
» The Lord Jehovah says : ‘ I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon . He will carry off her wealth and capture her spoil and seize her plunder . It will serve as wages for his army .
» ‘ I have given him the land of Egypt for the labor he performed , because they acted for me , ’ ’ declares the Lord Jehovah .
» On that day I will make a horn sprout for the house of Israel make the people of Israel strong again , and I give you , Ezekiel , something to say among them . Then they will know that I am Jehovah . «
Jehovah continued to speak his word to me :
» Son of man , prophesy . Say , ‘ The Lord Jehovah says : » Cry for that day !
» ‘ The day is near . The Day of Jehovah is near . It will be a gloomy day , a time of trouble for the nations .
» ‘ There will be war in Egypt and anguish in Ethiopia . Many Egyptians will fall dead . People will take away Egypt's wealth , and its foundations will be torn down .
» ‘ Sudan , Put , Lud , all the Arabs , the Libyans , and people from the promised land will die in battle . ’ «
» This is what Jehovah says : ‘ All Egypt's allies will die . Egypt's strength will disappear . People will die in war from Migdol to Syene , declares the Lord Jehovah ! ’
» ‘ Egypt will become the most desolate country in the world ! Egypt's cities will lie in ruins . They will be ruined more than other cities .
» ‘ Then they will know that I am Jehovah , because I will set fire to Egypt and all her defenders will be killed .
» ‘ On that day I will send messengers in ships to terrify those who live in safety in Sudan . The people of Sudan will be in anguish when Egypt is in trouble . That day is coming ! ’
» This is what the Lord Jehovah says : I will use King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon to bring an end to Egypt .
» He and his troops , the most ruthless troops among the nations , will be brought to destroy the land . They will draw their swords to attack Egypt and fill the land with dead bodies .
» I will dry up the Nile River and sell the land to wicked people . I will have foreigners destroy the land and everything in it . I , Jehovah , have spoken . ’
» This is what the Lord Jehovah says : ‘ I will destroy the statues and put an end to the idols in Memphis . A prince will never rise again in Egypt . I will spread fear throughout Egypt .
» ‘ I will destroy Pathros , set fire to Zoan and bring punishment on Thebes .
» ‘ I will pour out my fury on Sin , Egypt's fortress , and I will kill many people in Thebes .
» ‘ I will set fire to Egypt . Sin will be in much pain . Thebes will be broken into pieces , and Memphis will be in trouble every day .
» ‘ The young men from Heliopolis and Bubastis will die in battle , and people from these cities will go into exile .
» ‘ At Tahpanhes the day will turn dark when I break Egypt's power . Egypt's strong army will be defeated . Clouds will cover Egypt , and people from its villages will go into exile . ’ «
» ‘ Then they will know that I am Jehovah , because I will bring punishment on Egypt .
On the seventh day of the first month in the eleventh year , Jehovah spoke his word to me :
» Son of man , I have broken the arm of Pharaoh , king of Egypt . His arm is not bandaged , so it cannot heal and be strong enough to hold a sword . «
» The Lord Jehovah says : ‘ I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt . I will break his arms , both the strong and the broken . I will make the sword fall from his hand .
‘ » I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands .
‘ » For I will strengthen the arms the power of the king of Babylon and put my sword in his hand . I will break the arms of Pharaoh . He will groan before him with the groanings of a wounded man .
‘ » I will strengthen the arms the power of the king of Babylon , but the arms of Pharaoh will fall . Then they will know that I am Jehovah , when I put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon and he stretches it out against the land of Egypt .
‘ » When I scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands , then they will know that I am Jehovah . ’ «
In the eleventh year , in the third month , on the first of the month , the word of Jehovah came to me :
» Son of man , say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his hordes : » ‘ Who are you like in your greatness ?
» ‘ Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon with beautiful branches and forest shade , and very high , and its top was among the clouds .
» ‘ The waters made it grow , the deep made it high . With its rivers it continually extended all around its planting place , and sent out its channels to all the trees of the field .
Therefore its height was loftier than all the trees of the field . ‘ « Its boughs became many and its branches long because of many waters as it spread them out .
» ‘ All the birds of the heavens nested in its boughs . Under its branches all the beasts of the field gave birth and all great nations lived under its shade .
» ‘ So it was beautiful in its greatness , in the length of its branches ; for its roots extended to many waters .
» ‘ The cedars in God's garden could not match it . The cypresses could not compare with its boughs . The plane trees could not match its branches . No tree in God's garden could compare with it in its beauty .
» ‘ I made it beautiful with the multitude of its branches . All the trees of Eden in the garden of God were jealous of it . ’
» The Lord Jehovah says : ‘ Because it is high in stature and has set its top among the clouds , and its heart is haughty in its loftiness ,
» ‘ I will give it into the hand of a despot of the nations . He will thoroughly deal with it . According to its wickedness I have driven it away .
» ‘ Alien tyrants of the nations have cut it down and left it . On the mountains and in all the valleys its branches have fallen and its boughs have been broken in all the ravines of the land . All the peoples of the earth have gone down from its shade and left it .
» ‘ On its ruin all the birds of the heavens will dwell . All the beasts of the field will be on its fallen branches
so that all the trees by the waters may not be exalted in their stature , nor set their top among the clouds , nor their well-watered mighty ones stand erect in their height . For they have all been given over to death , to the earth beneath , among the sons of men , with those who go down to the pit . ’
» The Lord Jehovah says : ‘ On the day when it went down to the grave I caused cries of sorrow . I closed the deep over it and held back its rivers . Its many waters were stopped up , and I made Lebanon mourn for it . All the trees of the field wilted away on account of it .
» ‘ I made the nations quake at the sound of its fall when I made it go down to the grave with those who go down to the pit . All the well-watered trees of Eden , the choicest and best of Lebanon , were comforted in the earth beneath .
» ‘ They also went down with it to the grave to those who were slain by the sword . Those who were its strength lived under its shade among the nations . ’
» ‘ Which of the trees of Eden are you equal to in glory and greatness ? Yet you will be brought down with the trees of Eden to the earth beneath . You will lie in the midst of the uncircumcised , with those who were slain by the sword . So is Pharaoh and all his hordes ! ’ ’ Declares the Lord Jehovah . « ’
In the twelfth year , in the twelfth month , on the first of the month , the word of Jehovah came to me :
» Son of man , take up a cry of sorrow and grief over Pharaoh king of Egypt . Say to him : ‘ You compared yourself to a young lion of the nations . » ‘ You are really like the monster in the seas . You burst forth in your rivers and muddied the waters with your feet and fouled their rivers . ’
» The Lord Jehovah says : ‘ Now I will spread my net over you with a company of many peoples . They will lift you up in my net .
» ‘ I will leave you on the land . I will cast you on the open field . I will cause all the birds of the heavens to dwell on you . And I will satisfy the beasts of the entire earth with you .
» ‘ I will lay your flesh on the mountains . I will fill the valleys with your refuse .
» ‘ I will also make the land drink the discharge of your blood as far away as the mountains . The ravines will be full of you . ’
» ‘ When I extinguish you , I will cover the heavens and darken their stars . I will cover the sun with a cloud and the moon will not give its light .
» ‘ All the shining lights in the heavens I will darken over you . And I will set darkness on your land , ’ ’ proclaims the Lord Jehovah .
» ‘ I will also trouble the hearts of many peoples when I bring your destruction among the nations , into lands you have not known .
» ‘ I will make many peoples astonished at you . Their kings will be dreadfully afraid of you when I brandish my sword before them . They will tremble every moment , every man for his own life , on the day of your fall . ’
» The Lord Jehovah says : ‘ You will face the sword of the king of Babylon .
» ‘ I will cut down your people with the swords of warriors . All of them will be the most ruthless warriors among the nations . They will shatter the pride of Egypt and destroy its many people .
» ‘ I will also destroy all the animals beside its many water sources . The feet of humans and the hoofs of animals will not stir up the water anymore . ’
» ‘ Then I will make its water clear and make its streams flow like oil , ’ ’ declares the Lord Jehovah .
» ‘ I will turn Egypt into a wasteland . I will take everything in the land , and I will kill all the people who live there . Then they will know that I am Jehovah .
» ‘ This is a funeral song . The people from the nations will sing this song . They will sing it as they mourn for Egypt and its many people , declares the Lord Jehovah . «
On the fifteenth day of the month in the twelfth year , Jehovah spoke his word to me . He said :
» Son of man , cry for the many people of Egypt . Bring them down along with the other mighty nations . Send them down below the earth to be with those who have gone down to the pit .
» ‘ Tell them : ‘ Are you more beautiful than anyone else ? Go down and join the godless people .
» ‘ The Egyptians will lie among those who were killed in battle . A sword has been drawn . Drag Egypt and its many people away .
» ‘ The mightiest warriors will say to Pharaoh from the grave : You and your defenders have come down . You now lie with the godless people who were killed in battle .
» ‘ Assyria is there with its whole army . The graves of its soldiers are all around it . All of its soldiers are dead . They have been killed in battle .
» ‘ Their graves are in the deepest parts of the pit . Assyria's army lies around its grave . All of its soldiers are dead . They have been killed in battle . They once terrified people in the land of the living .
» ‘ Elam is there with all its soldiers . The graves of its soldiers are all around it . All of its soldiers are dead . They have been killed in battle . They went down below the earth as godless people . They once terrified people in the land of the living . Now they suffer disgrace with those who have gone down to the pit .
» ‘ A bed has been made for Elam among the dead . The graves of its soldiers are all around it . The soldiers were godless people . They were killed in battle because they terrified others in the land of the living . They suffer disgrace with those who have gone down to the pit . They lie among the dead .
» ‘ Meshech and Tubal are there with all their soldiers . The graves of their soldiers are all around them . Their soldiers were all godless people . They were killed in battle because they terrified others in the land of the living .
» ‘ They do not lie with the godless warriors who died and went down to the grave with their weapons of war . Their swords were placed under their heads . Their iniquity rested on their bones because they terrified others in the land of the living .
You Egyptians will be crushed with the godless people . You will lie with those who were killed in battle .
» ‘ Edom is there with its kings and its princes . They used to be powerful , but now they lie with those who were killed in battle . They lie there with the godless people and with those who have gone down to the pit .
» ‘ All the rulers from the north and all the people from Sidon are there . They also went down with the dead . They are disgraced because they terrified people with their power . They were godless people . Now they lie with those who were killed in battle . They suffer disgrace with those who went down to the pit .
» ‘ Pharaoh and his army will see these things and be comforted over all the soldiers who have been killed in battle , ’ ’ proclaims the Lord Jehovah .
» ‘ I terrified people in the land of the living . Pharaoh and all his soldiers will be laid among the godless people who were killed in battle , ’ ’ proclaims the Lord Jehovah . «
Jehovah continued to speak to me :
» Son of man , speak to your people . Tell them : ‘ Suppose I bring war on this country and the people of this country choose one of their men and make him their watchman .
» ‘ If he sees the enemy coming to attack the country he will blow his horn to warn the people .
» ‘ If the people hear the horn and ignore the warning and the enemy comes and takes them , they will be responsible for their own deaths .
» ‘ They heard the sound of the horn but ignored its warning . In that case they are responsible for their own deaths . If they had taken the warning they would have saved themselves .
» ‘ But if the watchman sees the enemy coming and does not blow his horn to warn the people and the enemy comes and kills someone , that watchman must die because of his sin . I will hold him responsible for their deaths . ’
» Son of man , I have appointed you as a watchman for the people of Israel . Listen to what I say and warn them for me .
» Suppose I say to a wicked person , ‘ You wicked person , you will certainly die . ’ ’ And you say nothing to warn him to change his ways . That wicked person will die because of his sin . I will hold you responsible for his death .
» But if you warn a wicked man to turn from his way and he does not turn from his way , he will die in his iniquity , but you have delivered your life .
» ‘ Son of man , say to the house of Israel : ‘ You people have said : » Our transgressions and our sins are upon us . We are rotting away in them . How can we survive ? « ’
Say to them : ‘ » As I am alive ! « Declares the Lord Jehovah . » I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked . Only that the wicked turn from his way and live . Turn back ! Turn back from your evil ways ! Why then will you die , O house of Israel ? « ’
» Son of man , tell the Israelites that when someone good sins , the good he has done will not save him . If an evil person stops doing evil he will not be punished , and if a good man starts sinning , his life will not be spared .
» I may promise life to someone good , but if he starts thinking that his past goodness is enough and begins to sin , I will not remember any of the good he did . He will die because of his sins .
» ‘ I may warn someone evil that he is going to die , but if he stops sinning and does what is right and good ,
and if he returns the security he took for a loan or gives back what he stole , if he stops sinning and follows the laws that give life , he will not die , but he will live .
» ‘ None of the sins that he has done will be remembered . He has done what is fair and right . He will certainly live . ’
» But your people say : ‘ Jehovah’s way is not right . ’ ’ Yet , their ways are not right .
» If the righteous person turns from the right things that he has done and does evil , he will die because of it .
» If the wicked person turns from his wickedness and does what is fair and right , he will live because of it .
» The people of Israel say : ‘ Jehovah’s way is not right . ’ ’ I will judge each of you by your own ways , people of Israel . «
On the fifth day of the tenth month in the twelfth year of our captivity , a refugee from Jerusalem came to me . He said : » The city has been captured . «
The evening before the refugee arrived , the power of Jehovah came over me . On the morning the refugee arrived , Jehovah made me speak . So I spoke , and I was no longer quiet .
Jehovah spoke his word to me :
» Son of man , those who live in the ruined cities in Israel are saying : ‘ Abraham was only one person , and he was given the land . But we are many . Certainly the land has been given to us . ’
» ‘ » Tell them : ‘ The Lord Jehovah says : » You eat meat with blood in it . You look to your idols for help . You murder people . Should the land be given to you ?
» ‘ » You rely on your swords military power . You do disgusting things . You dishonor your neighbor's wife . Should the land be given to you ? « ’
» Tell them : ‘ This is what the Lord Jehovah says : » As I am alive , whoever is in the ruined cities will be killed in battle . Whoever is in the open field will become food for wild animals . Whoever is in fortified places and caves will die from plagues .
» I will turn the land into a barren wasteland . People will no longer brag about its power . The mountains of Israel will become so ruined that no one will travel through them .
» Then people will know that I am Jehovah , when I make the land a barren wasteland . This is because of all the disgusting things that they have done . « ’
» Son of man , your people are talking about you by the walls and in the doorways of their homes . They are saying to each other : ‘ Let's go and hear the word that has come from Jehovah . ’
» Then they come to you , as if they are still my people , and they sit down in front of you . They listen to what you say , but they do not do it . They say that they love me , but in their hearts they chase dishonest profits .
» To them you are nothing more than a singer with a beautiful voice who sings love songs or a musician who plays an instrument . They listen to your words , but they do not do them .
» When all your words come true , and they certainly will come true , these people will know that a prophet has been among them . «
Jehovah continued to speak to me :
» Son of man , prophesy against the shepherds of Israel . Prophesy to these shepherds . Tell them : ‘ The Lord Jehovah says : » How horrible it will be for the shepherds of Israel who have been taking care of only themselves . Should shepherds take care of the sheep ?
» ‘ » You eat the best parts of the sheep , dress in the wool , and butcher the finest sheep . Yet , you do not take care of the sheep .
» ‘ » You have not strengthened those that were weak , healed those who were sick , or bandaged those who were injured . You have not brought back those who strayed away or looked for those who were lost . You have ruled them harshly and violently .
» ‘ » They were scattered because there was no shepherd . They became food for every wild animal at the time they were scattered .
» ‘ » My sheep wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill . They were scattered throughout the entire earth . No one searched or looked for them .
» ‘ » You shepherds , listen to the word of Jehovah .
‘ » As I am alive , declares the Lord Jehovah , because there is no shepherd , my sheep have become prey . My sheep have become food for wild animals . My shepherds have not searched for my sheep . They have taken care of only themselves , not my sheep . « ’
You shepherds , hear the word of Jehovah :
» The Lord Jehovah says : ‘ I am against the shepherds ! I will demand my sheep from them and make them cease from feeding sheep . So the shepherds will not feed themselves anymore . I will deliver my flock from their mouth , so that they will not be food for them . ’ «
» ‘ The Lord Jehovah says : ‘ I will search for my sheep . I will seek them out .
» As a shepherd cares for his herd in the day when he is among his scattered sheep , so I will care for my sheep and will deliver them from all the places where they were scattered on a cloudy and gloomy day .
» I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries and bring them to their own land . I will feed them on the mountains of Israel . I will feed them by the streams , and in all the inhabited places of the land .
» I will feed them in a good pasture , and their grazing ground will be on the mountain heights of Israel . There they will lie down on good grazing ground and feed in rich pasture on the mountains of Israel . «
» ‘ » I will feed my flock and I will lead them to rest , « declares the Lord Jehovah .
» I will seek the lost . I will bring back the scattered . I will bind up the broken and strengthen the sick . The fat and the strong I will destroy . I will feed them with judgment . «
» ‘ As for you , my sheep , this is what the Lord Jehovah says : » I will judge disputes between one sheep and another , between rams and male goats .
» ‘ Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture ? Must you trample the rest of the pasture with your feet ? You drink clean water . Must you muddy the rest of the water with your feet ?
» ‘ Must my sheep eat what your feet have trampled and drink what your feet have muddied ? «
» ‘ This is what the Lord Jehovah says to them : I will judge disputes between the fat sheep and the skinny sheep .
» ‘ You fat sheep push the skinny sheep with your sides and shoulders . You knock down all the sick sheep with your horns . You have scattered them all over .
» ‘ So I will rescue my sheep , and they will no longer be prey . I will judge between one sheep and another .
» ‘ I will place one shepherd over them , my servant David . He will take care of them . He will take care of them and be their shepherd .
» ‘ I , Jehovah , will be their God , and my servant David will be their prince . I , Jehovah , have spoken !
» ‘ » I will promise them peace . I will remove the wild animals from the land so that my sheep can live safely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods .
» ‘ » I will bless them and the places around my hill . I will send rain at the right time . These showers will be a blessing to them .
» ‘ » Then the trees in the field will produce fruit , the land will yield crops , and my sheep will live safely in their land . Then they will know that I am Jehovah , because I will break off the bars on their yokes and rescue them from the people who made them slaves .
» ‘ » They will no longer be prey to the nations . Wild animals will no longer eat them . They will live safely , and no one will frighten them .
» ‘ » I will give them a place that is known for its good crops . They will no longer experience hunger in the land . They will no longer suffer the insults of other nations .
‘ Then they will know that Jehovah their God is with them . They will know that the people of Israel are my people , ’ ’ proclaims the Lord Jehovah . « ’
» ‘ You are my sheep , the sheep in my pasture . You are mortal , and I am your God , ’ ’ declares the Lord Jehovah . «
The word of Jehovah continued to come to me :
» Son of man , set your face commit yourself against Mount Seir , and prophesy against it .
» Say this , ‘ the Lord Jehovah says : » I am against you , Mount Seir ! I will stretch out my hand exert my power against you and make you a desolation and a waste .
» ‘ » I will lay waste your cities and you will become desolated . Then you will know that I am Jehovah .
» ‘ » Because you have had everlasting enmity and have delivered the sons of Israel to the power of the sword to die by warfare at the time of their calamity , at the time of the punishment of the end . « ’
» ‘ Therefore as I live , declares the Lord Jehovah : I will give you over to bloodshed death , and bloodshed death will pursue you . Since you have not hated bloodshed , therefore bloodshed will pursue you .
» ‘ I will make Mount Seir a waste and desolation . I will cut off from it the one who passes through and returns .
» ‘ I will fill its mountains with those who have been killed . Those killed by the sword will fall on your hills and in your valleys and ravines .
» ‘ I will make you an everlasting desolation ! Your cities will not be inhabited . Then you will know that I am Jehovah ! ’
» For the reason that you have said : ‘ These two nations and these two lands will be mine , and we will possess them , ’ ’ although Jehovah was there .
‘ Therefore as I live , ’ ’ declares the Lord Jehovah , ‘ I will deal with you according to your anger and according to your envy , what you showed because of your hatred against them . I will make myself known among them when I judge you .
» ‘ Then you will know that I , Jehovah , have heard all your insults you have spoken against the mountains of Israel . You said : ‘ They are laid desolate . They are given to us for food . ’
» ‘ You have spoken arrogantly against me and have continuously spoken against me . And I have heard it ! ’
» The Lord Jehovah says : ‘ As all the earth rejoices , I will make you desolated .
» As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel because it was desolate , so I will do to you . You will be desolated , O Mount Seir , and all Edom , all of it . Then they will know that I am Jehovah . ’ «
» Son of man , prophesy to the mountains of Israel and say : ‘ O mountains of Israel , hear the word of Jehovah .
‘ » ‘ The Lord Jehovah says : » Because the enemy has spoken against you , aha ! And the everlasting heights have become our possession .
» Therefore prophesy and say : ‘ The Lord Jehovah says : For good reason they have made you desolate and crushed you from every side . That way you would become a possession of the rest of the nations and you have become a subject of conversation for the people .
‘ » ‘ Therefore , O mountains of Israel , hear the word of the Lord Jehovah . The Lord Jehovah says to the mountains and to the hills , to the ravines and to the valleys , to the desolate wastes and to the forsaken cities that have become a prey and derision to the rest of the nations that are round about ,
‘ » ‘ The Lord Jehovah says : ‘ Surely in the fire of my jealousy I have spoken against the rest of the nations , and against all Edom , who appropriated my land for themselves as a possession with wholehearted joy and with scorn , to drive it out for a prey . ’ « ’
» Prophesy about Israel and tell the mountains and hills and the ravines and valleys : ‘ This is what the Lord Jehovah says : » I am speaking in my anger and fury because you have been insulted by the nations .
» This is what the Lord Jehovah says : ‘ I raise my hand and swear that the nations that surround you will be insulted .
» ‘ But you , mountains of Israel , will grow branches and bear fruit for my people Israel . My people will come home soon .
» ‘ I am for you . I will turn to you , and you will be plowed and planted .
» ‘ I will increase the number of people who live on you . All the people of Israel , all of them , will live on you . The cities will be inhabited , and the ruins will be rebuilt .
» ‘ I will increase the number of people and animals that live on you . They will grow and become many . I will let people live on you as in the past , and I will make you better off than ever before . Then you will know that I am Jehovah .
» ‘ I will bring people , my people Israel , to you . They will take possession of you , and you will be their inheritance . You will no longer take their children away from them . ’ «
» The Lord Jehovah says : ‘ People say that you devour your people and take the children away from your nation . « ’
‘ You will no longer devour your people or take the children away from your nation , proclaims the Lord Jehovah .
‘ I will no longer let you hear the insults from the nations . You will no longer suffer the disgrace of the people . You will never again take the children away from your own nation , proclaims the Lord Jehovah . «
Jehovah continued to speak his word to me , He said :
» Son of man , when the people of Israel lived in their land , they dishonored it by the way they lived and by everything they did . Their ways were as unclean as a woman's menstrual period .
» Therefore I poured out my fury on them because they poured out blood on the land and they dishonored the land with their idols .
» I forced them into other nations . They became scattered among the nations . I judged them based on the way that they lived and based on everything that they had done .
» Wherever they went among the nations , they dishonored my holy name . People said about them : ‘ These are Jehovah’s people , yet they had to leave his land . ’
» I became concerned about my holy name because my people dishonored it among the nations wherever they went . «
» So tell the people of Israel , ‘ the Lord Jehovah says : » I am about to do something , people of Israel . I will not do this for your sake but for the sake of my holy name , which you have dishonored among the nations wherever you have gone . « ’
» I will reveal the holiness of my great name , which has been dishonored by the nations . It is the name that you have dishonored among them . Then the nations will know that I am Jehovah . This is because I will reveal my holiness among you as they watch , ’ ’ declares the Lord Jehovah .
» I will take you from the nations and gather you from every country . I will bring you back to your own land .
» I will sprinkle clean water on you and make you clean instead of unclean . Then I will cleanse you from all your idols .
» I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you . I will remove your stubborn hearts and give you obedient hearts .
» I will put my Spirit in you . I will enable you to live by my Laws , and you will obey my rules .
» Then you will live in the land that I gave your ancestors . You will be my people , and I will be your God . ’
» ‘ I will rescue you from all your uncleanness . I will make the grain grow so that you will never again have famines .
» ‘ I will make fruit grow on the trees and crops grow in the fields so that you will no longer suffer disgrace among the nations because of famines .
» ‘ Then you will remember your evil ways and the bad things that you did . You will hate yourselves for all these wicked and disgusting things .
» ‘ I want you to know that I am not doing this for your sake , ’ ’ proclaims the Lord Jehovah . ‘ Be ashamed and disgraced because of your ways , people of Israel . ’
» This is what the Lord Jehovah says : ‘ On the day that I cleanse you from all your wickedness , I will cause your cities to be lived in again , and your ruins will be rebuilt .
The wasteland will be cultivated . It will no longer remain empty for everyone passing by to see .
People will say : » This wasteland has become like the Garden of Eden . The cities were destroyed . They were empty and ruined , but now they are fortified and have people living in them .
‘ The surrounding nations that are left will know that I , Jehovah , have rebuilt the ruined places and planted crops in the land that was empty . I , Jehovah , have spoken , and I have done it . ’
» This is what the Lord Jehovah says : ‘ I will also let the people of Israel ask me to make them as numerous as sheep .
» They will be like the sheep for sacrifices , like the sheep in Jerusalem during the appointed festivals . Their ruined cities will be filled with flocks of people . Then they will know that I am Jehovah . ’ «
The hand of Jehovah was upon me , and he brought me out by the Spirit of Jehovah and set me down in the middle of the valley . The valley was full of bones .
He caused me to pass among them round about . There were very many on the surface of the valley and they were very dry .
He said to me : » Son of man , can these bones live ? « I answered , » O Lord Jehovah , you know . «
» ‘ Again he said : » Prophesy over these bones and say to them , ‘ O dry bones , hear the word of Jehovah .
» ‘ The Lord Jehovah says to these bones : » I will cause breath to enter you that you may come to life .
» ‘ I will put sinews on you , make flesh grow back on you , cover you with skin and put breath in you that you may come alive . You will know that I am Jehovah . « ’ «
So I prophesied as I was commanded . As I prophesied , there was a noise , and behold , a rattling . The bones came together , bone to its bone .
I looked , sinews were on them , and flesh grew and skin covered them . But there was no breath in them .
Then Jehovah said to me : » Prophesy to the wind ruach : air , breath , spirit , life ! Prophesy , son of man . Tell the wind , this is what the Lord Jehovah says : ‘ Come from the four winds , O Breath , and breathe on these people who were killed so that they will live . « ’ «
So I prophesied as he commanded me , and the breath of life entered them . Then they came to life and stood on their feet . There were enough of them to form a very large army .
Jehovah also said : » Son of man , all the people of Israel are like these bones . The people say : Our bones are dry , and our hope has vanished . We are completely destroyed .
Prophesy and tell them : ‘ This is what the Lord Jehovah says : » My people , I will open your graves and take you out of them . I will bring you to Israel .
Then , my people , you will know that I am Jehovah , because I will open your graves and bring you out of your graves . « ’
‘ I will put my Spirit in you , and you will live . I will place you in your own land . Then you will know that I , Jehovah , have spoken , and I have done it , ’ ’ declares Jehovah . «
Jehovah spoke his word to me again :
» Son of man , take a stick and write on it : For Judah and for the Israelites who are associated with it . ’ ’ Then take another stick and write on it : ‘ The stick of Ephraim , for Joseph and for all the people of Israel associated with it . ’
Then join both sticks together so that they will be one in your hand . Your people will say to you :
‘ Tell us what you mean by this . ’
Then say to them : ‘ This is what the Lord Jehovah says : I will take Joseph's stick , which is in Ephraim's hand , and the tribes of Israel associated with it , and I will put them with Judah's stick . I will make them into one stick . They will be one in my hand . « ’
When you hold the sticks in your hand , let the people see them .
» Tell them : ‘ The Lord Jehovah says : » I will take the Israelites out of the nations where they have gone . I will gather them from everywhere and bring them to their own land .
I will form them into one nation in the land on the mountains of Israel . One king will rule all of them . They will no longer be two nations or be divided into two kingdoms .
They will no longer dishonor themselves with their idols , with their detestable things , or with their rebellious acts . I will forgive them for all the times they turned away from me and sinned . I will cleanse them so that they will be my people , and I will be their God .
» ‘ » My servant David will be their king . All of them will have one shepherd . They will live by my rules , and they will obey my laws .
» ‘ » They will live in the land that I gave my servant Jacob , the land where their ancestors lived . They , their children , and their grandchildren will live in it for a very long time . My servant David will be their prince for a very long time .
» ‘ » I will promise them peace . This will be a long lasting promise . I will establish them and make them increase in number . I will put my holy place among them for a very long time .
» ‘ » My dwelling place will be with them . I will be their God , and they will be my people .
» ‘ » Then the nations will know that I , Jehovah , have set Israel apart as holy , because my holy place will be among them permanently . « ’ «
The word of Jehovah came to me :
» Son of man , set your face toward Gog of the land of Magog , the prince of Rosh , Meshech and Tubal , and prophesy against him .
The Lord Jehovah said : » I am against you , O Gog , prince of Rosh , Meshech and Tubal .
» I will turn you about and put hooks into your jaws . I will bring you out , and all your army , horses and horsemen , all of them splendidly attired , a great company with buckler and shield , all of them wielding swords .
» I will also bring out Persia , Ethiopia and Put with them , all of them with shield and helmet ;
» Gomer with all its troops ; Beth-togarmah from the remote parts of the north with all its troops and many peoples with you . «
» ‘ » Be prepared , and prepare yourself , you and all your companies that are assembled about you , and be a guard for them .
» ‘ » After many days you will be summoned . In the latter years you will come into the land that is restored from the sword , whose inhabitants have been gathered from many nations to the mountains of Israel that had been a continual waste . Its people were brought out from the nations , and all of them are living securely .
‘ » You will go up like a storm . You will be like a cloud covering the land . You your troops will have many peoples with you . « ’
» The Lord Jehovah says : ‘ It will come about on that day , that thoughts will come into your mind and you will devise an evil plan .
» » You will say : » I will go up against the land of unwalled villages . I will go against those who are securely at rest . They live without walls and have no bars or gates . «
» I will go to capture spoil and to seize plunder , to turn your hand against the waste places which are now inhabited , and against the people who are gathered from the nations , who have acquired cattle and goods , who live at the center of the world .
‘ » Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish with all its villages will say to you : Have you come to capture spoil ? Have you assembled your company to seize plunder , to carry away silver and gold , to take away cattle and goods , to capture great spoil ? « ’
» Prophesy , son of man , and say to Gog : ‘ The Lord Jehovah says : » On that day when my people Israel are living securely , will you not know it ?
» ‘ You will come from your place out of the remote parts of the north , you and many nations with you , all of them riding on horses , a great assembly and a mighty army .
» ‘ You will come up against my people Israel like a cloud to cover the land . It shall come about in the last days that I will bring you against my land , so that the nations may know me when I am sanctified through you before their eyes , O Gog . « ’
» The Lord Jehovah says : ‘ Are you the one of whom I spoke in former days through my servants the prophets of Israel , who prophesied in those days for many years that I would bring you against them ?
» ‘ It will come about on that day , when Gog comes against the land of Israel , ’ ’ declares the Lord Jehovah , ‘ that my fury will mount up in my anger .
» ‘ In my zeal and in my blazing wrath I proclaim that on that day there will surely be a great earthquake in the land of Israel .
» ‘ The fish of the sea , the birds of the sky , the beasts of the field , all the creeping things that creep on the earth , and all the people who are on the face of the earth will shake at my presence ! The mountains will be thrown down ! The steep pathways will collapse and every wall will fall to the ground . ’
» ‘ I will call for a sword against Gog on all my mountains , ’ ’ declares the Lord Jehovah . ‘ Every man's sword will be against his brother .
» ‘ With pestilence and with blood I will enter into judgment on him . I will rain on him and on his troops , and on the many peoples who are with him , a torrential rain , with hailstones , fire and brimstone .
» ‘ I will magnify myself , sanctify myself , and make myself known in the sight of many nations ! Then they will know that I am Jehovah . ’
» The Lord Jehovah says : ‘ Son of man , denounce Gog , the chief ruler of the nations of Meshech and Tubal . » Tell him that I am his enemy .
» ‘ I will turn him in a new direction and lead him out of the far north until he comes to the mountains of Israel .
» ‘ I will knock his bow out of his left hand and his arrows out of his right hand .
» ‘ Gog and his army and his allies will fall dead on the mountains of Israel . I will let their bodies be food for all the birds and wild animals . « ’
» ‘ They will fall dead in the open field . I , ’ ’ the Lord Jehovah , ‘ have spoken .
» ‘ I will start a fire in the land of Magog and along all the seacoasts where people live undisturbed . Everyone will know that I am Jehovah !
‘ I will make sure that my people Israel know my holy name . I will not let my name be disgraced any more . Then the nations will know that I , Jehovah , am the holy God of Israel . ’
» ‘ The Lord Jehovah says : ‘ The day I spoke about is certain to come .
» ‘ The people who live in the cities of Israel will go out and collect the abandoned weapons for firewood . They will build fires with the shields , bows , arrows , spears , and clubs , and have enough to last for seven years .
» ‘ They will not have to gather firewood in the fields or cut down trees in the forest , because they will have the abandoned weapons to burn . They will loot and plunder those who looted and plundered them . The Lord Jehovah has spoken . ’
» ‘ On that day I will give Gog a burial ground there in Israel , the valley of those who pass by east of the sea . It will block off those who would pass by . So they will bury Gog there with his entire horde , and they will call it the valley of Hamon-gog Multitude of God .
» ‘ For seven months the house of Israel will be burying them in order to cleanse the land .
» ‘ Even all the people of the land will bury them . It will be to their renown on the day that I glorify myself , ’ ’ proclaims the Lord Jehovah .
» ‘ They will set apart men who will constantly pass through the land , burying those who were passing through , even those left on the surface of the ground , in order to cleanse it . At the end of seven months they will make a search .
» ‘ As those who pass through the land pass through and anyone sees a man's bone , then he will set up a marker by it until the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog .
» ‘ Even the name of the city will be Hamonah . In this way they will cleanse the land . ’
» As for you , son of man , the Lord Jehovah says : ‘ Speak to every kind of bird and to every beast of the field : » Assemble and come , gather from every side to my sacrifice that I am going to sacrifice for you . It is a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel , that you may eat flesh and drink blood .
» ‘ You will eat the flesh of mighty men and drink the blood of the princes of the earth , as though they were rams , lambs , goats and bulls , all of them fatlings of Bashan . « ’
» ‘ You will eat fat until you are glutted , and drink blood until you are drunk ; from my sacrifice I have sacrificed for you . « ’
» ‘ You will be glutted at my table with horses and charioteers , with mighty men and all the men of war , ’ ’ declares the Lord Jehovah .
» I will show my greatness among the nations . All the nations will see how I will turn my power against them to punish them .
» From that day on , the people of Israel will know that I am Jehovah their God .
» Then the nations will know that the people of Israel went into captivity because they did wrong and rebelled against me . I hid my face withdrew my support from them and handed them over to their enemies . They were killed in battle .
» I paid them back for their uncleanness and their sins . I hid my face from them . ’
» This is what the Lord Jehovah says : ‘ Now I will bring back Jacob's captives and have compassion for the whole nation of Israel . I will stand up for show exclusive devotion for my holy name .
» When they live safely in a land where no one will frighten them , they will forget their shame and all the unfaithful things they have done against me .
» I will bring them back from the other nations and gather them from the countries of their enemies . Many nations will see that I am holy . ’
» ‘ My people will know that I am Jehovah their God . I sent them into captivity among the nations , and I brought them back again to their land . I left none of them behind .
» ‘ I will no longer hide my face withdraw my support from them . I will pour out my Spirit on the nation of Israel , ’ ’ declares the Lord Jehovah . «
It was the tenth day of the month in the beginning of the twenty-fifth year of our captivity and fourteen years after Jerusalem was captured . At that time Jehovah’s power came over me , and he brought me to Jerusalem .
In visions , God brought me to Israel and set me down on a very high mountain . On the south side of the mountain were buildings that looked like those in a city .
He brought me closer . I saw a man who looked like he was covered with bronze . The man was holding a linen tape measure and a measuring stick , and he stood in a gateway .
He said to me : » Son of man , look with your eyes , and listen with your ears . Pay close attention to everything I am going to show you . The reason you were brought here is to see these things . Tell the nation of Israel about everything that you see . «
I saw a wall that surrounded the Temple . The man had a measuring stick that was ten and one half feet long . He measured the wall . It was ten and one half feet thick and ten and one half feet high .
The man went to the gateway that faced east . He went up its steps and measured the entrance to the gateway . It was ten and one half feet wide .
There were also guardrooms . Each guardroom was ten and one half feet long and ten and one half feet wide . The space between the guardrooms was nine feet thick . And the entrance to the gateway by the entrance hall of the temple was ten and one half feet wide .
He also measured the entrance hall of the gateway .
It extended fourteen feet from the Temple . Its recessed walls were three and one half feet thick . The gateway's entrance hall faced the Temple .
There were three guardrooms on each side of the eastern gateway . All three rooms on each side were the same size , and the recessed walls on each side were the same size .
The man measured the width of the entrance to the gateway . It was seventeen and one half feet wide , and the gateway was twenty-three feet long .
There was a barrier about twenty-one inches in front of each guardroom . The guardrooms were ten and one half feet square .
He measured the gateway from the top of one guardroom to the top of the opposite guardroom . It was forty-four feet wide from one door to the opposite door .
He also measured the entrance hall . It was thirty-five feet wide . In front of the entrance hall to the gateway was a courtyard on all sides .
The total length of the gateway from the front of the outer part to the front of the inner part of the entrance hall was eighty-seven and one half feet .
The guardrooms and recessed walls inside the gateway had small windows all around . The entrance hall also had windows all around on the inside . Pictures of palm trees were carved on the recessed walls .
Then the man brought me into the outer courtyard . I saw rooms there and pavement all around the courtyard . There were thirty rooms along the edge of the pavement .
The pavement in the lower courtyard ran alongside the gateways . It was as wide as it was long .
The man measured the distance from the inside of the lower gateway to the outside of the inner courtyard . It was one hundred and seventy-five feet from the east and to the north .
The man measured the length and width of the gateway , leading to the outer courtyard . This was the gateway that faced north .
Its three guardrooms , its recessed walls , and its entrance hall were the same size as those in the east gateway . The gateway was eighty-seven and one half feet long and forty-four feet wide .
Its windows , recessed walls , and palm tree pictures were the same size as those in the east gateway . Seven steps went up to it and led to its entrance hall .
The inner courtyard had a gateway opposite the north gate just like the east gateway . The man measured the distance from one gate to the other gate . It was one hundred and seventy-five feet .
The man led me to the south side , and I saw a gateway that faced south . He measured its recessed walls and its entrance hall . They were the same size as those of the other gateways .
The gateway and its entrance hall had windows on all sides like the windows in the other gateways . It was eighty-seven and one half feet long and forty-four feet wide .
Seven steps went up to it and led to its entrance hall . Pictures of palm trees were carved on the recessed walls , one picture on each side .
The inner courtyard had a gateway facing south . The man measured the distance from the gateway on the south side to its opposite gateway . It was one hundred and seventy-five feet .
The man brought me to the inner courtyard through the south gateway . He measured the south gateway . It was the same size as the others .
Its guardrooms , recessed walls , and entrance hall were the same size as the other gateways . The guardrooms and the entrance hall had windows all around . The gateway was eighty-seven and one half feet long and forty-four feet wide .
There were entrance halls all around the inner courtyard . They were all forty-four feet long and nine feet wide .
The entrance halls faced the outer courtyard . Pictures of palm trees were carved on the recessed walls , and eight steps led up to each gateway .
The man brought me to the east side of the inner courtyard . He measured the gateway . It was the same size as the others .
Its guardrooms , recessed walls , and entrance halls were the same size as those of the other gateways . Its guardrooms and entrance hall had windows all around . The gateway was eighty-seven and one half feet long and forty-four feet wide .
Its entrance hall faced the outer courtyard . Pictures of palm trees were carved on the recessed walls , and eight steps led up to the gateway .
Then the man brought me to the north gateway . He measured it . It was the same size as the others .
Its guardrooms , recessed walls , and entrance hall had windows all around . The gateway was eighty-seven and one half feet long and forty-four feet wide .
Its recessed walls faced the outer courtyard . Pictures of palm trees were carved on the recessed walls , and eight steps led up to the gateway .
There was a room with a door that opened toward the entrance hall of the gateway . This is the room where the priests washed the animals for the burnt offerings .
There were two tables on each side of the entrance hall of the gateway . On these tables the animals were slaughtered for burnt offerings , offerings for sin , and guilt offerings .
On each side of the entrance to the north gateway there were two tables , and on the other side of the entrance hall of the gateway there were two tables .
So there were four tables on each side of the gateway , eight tables in all , on which they slaughtered animals .
There were four tables made of cut stone for burnt offerings . They were three feet long , three feet wide , and twenty-one inches high . On these tables the priests laid the utensils that were used to slaughter animals for burnt offerings and sacrifices .
Double-pronged hooks , three inches long , were attached to the wall all around the room , and the tables were for the meat of the animals .
Outside the gateways to the inner courtyard were the rooms for the singers in the inner courtyards . One room was at the side of the north gateway . It faced south . The other room was at the side of the south gateway . It faced north .
The man said to me : » This room that faces south is for the priests who serve in the temple .
The room that faces north is for the priests who serve at the altar . These priests are Zadok's descendants . They are the only Levites who are able to come near Jehovah and serve him . «
The man measured the courtyard . It was a perfect square : one hundred and seventy-five feet long and one hundred and seventy-five feet wide . The altar was in front of the Temple .
The man brought me to the entrance hall of the Temple and measured its recessed walls . They were nine feet on each side . The gateway was twenty-four and one half feet wide , and the walls on each side were five feet wide .
The entrance hall was thirty-five feet long and twenty-one feet wide . Steps led up to it . Pillars stood by the recessed walls , one on each side of the entrance hall .
The man brought me into the Holy Place in the Temple and measured the recessed walls . They were ten and one half feet wide on each side .
The entrance was seventeen and one half feet wide , and on each side of the entrance the walls were nine feet wide . Then he measured the length of the holy place . It was seventy feet long and thirty-five feet wide .
He went inside and measured the passageway . It was three and one half feet thick . The entrance was ten and one half feet high and twelve feet wide .
He measured the room at the end of the holy place . It was thirty-five feet long and thirty-five feet wide . The man said : » This is the Most Holy Place Holy of Holies . «
Next , the man measured the Temple wall . It was ten and one half feet wide , and each side room around the Temple was seven feet .
The rooms were arranged on three different stories . There were thirty rooms on each story . These rooms had supports all the way around the Temple wall , but these supports were not fastened to the Temple wall .
The side rooms grew wider all the way around as they went up , story after story . The surrounding structure went from story to story all around the Temple . The structure grew wider as it went higher . A stairway went from the first story through the second story to the third story .
I also saw a raised base all around the Temple . This base was the foundation for the side rooms . It measured the full length of the measuring rod , ten and one half feet .
The outer wall of the side rooms was nine feet thick . There was an open area between the side rooms connected to the Temple
and the priests' rooms . It was thirty-five feet wide and went all around the Temple .
The doors in the side rooms were entrances into the open area . There was one door to the north and another to the south . The base of the open area was nine feet wide all the way around .
At the far end of the open area , on the west side of the temple , was a building one hundred twenty-two and one-half feet wide . The wall of the building was nine feet thick all the way around , and it was one hundred fifty seven and one half feet long .
The man measured the Temple . It was one hundred and seventy-five feet long . This included the open area with the building and its walls . All together it was one hundred and seventy-five feet long .
The eastern side of the Temple , including the open area , was also one hundred and seventy-five feet wide .
He also measured the length of the building facing the courtyard on the west side along with its corridors on both sides . It was one hundred and seventy-five feet long . The holy place and the Most Holy Place were paneled .
The doorposts , the small windows , and the corridors of all three stories were paneled . The walls , from the floor up to the windows , were paneled .
In the space above the door to the Most Holy Place and on the walls all around it ,
there were pictures of cherubim angels and palm trees . Palm trees were positioned between each of the angels , and each angel had two faces :
the face of a man , which was turned toward a palm tree on one side , and the face of a lion , which was turned toward a palm tree on the other side . These pictures were carved all around the Temple .
Pictures of cherubim angels and palm trees were carved on the walls from the floor to the space above the door .
The doorframes in the Holy Place were square . In front of the Most Holy Place was something similar .
There was a wooden altar . It was five feet high and three and one half feet wide . Its corners , its base , and its sides were made of wood . Then the man told me : This is the table that is in the presence of Jehovah .
The Holy Place and the Most Holy Place had two doors .
Each of the doors were double doors that swung open .
Pictures of cherubim angels and palm trees were carved on the doors of the Holy Place as on the walls . There was a wooden roof hanging over the outer entrance hall .
There were small windows and palm trees on both sides of the entrance hall , on the side rooms of the Temple , and on the roofs .
The man led me out to the north to the outer courtyard . He brought me to the side rooms opposite both the open area and the northern building .
The building that faced north was one hundred and seventy-five feet long and eighty-seven and one half feet wide .
Opposite the inner courtyard was an area that was thirty-five feet wide , and opposite the pavement of the outer courtyard were corridors facing corridors on all three stories .
In front of the side rooms was a walkway . It was seventeen and one half feet wide and one hundred and seventy-five feet long . The doors of these side rooms faced north .
The side rooms on the third story were narrower than those on the first or second stories of the building because the corridors took space away from them .
The rooms were in three stories . They did not have pillars like the pillars in the courtyards . That is why the rooms on the third story were set farther back than those on the first and second stories .
There was a wall that ran parallel to the side rooms and the outer courtyard . It ran alongside the side rooms for eighty-seven and one half feet .
The row of rooms in the outer courtyard was eighty-seven and one half feet long . The rooms that faced the temple were one hundred and seventy-five feet long .
These lower side rooms had an entrance on the east side . A person was able to enter the outer courtyard through them .
There were side rooms parallel to the wall of the courtyard on the south side . They faced the open area and the building .
There was a walkway in front of them . It was like the one that was in front of the side rooms on the north side . These side rooms were as long and as wide as the northern rooms . They had similar exits , dimensions , and doors .
The doors to the south rooms were the same as the doors to the north rooms . There was a doorway at the other end of the walkway that was parallel to the corresponding wall that ran eastward . People entered through that doorway .
The man said : » The northern and southern side rooms that face the open area are holy rooms . These rooms are where the priests who come near Jehovah eat the holiest offerings . Because these rooms are holy , the priests keep the holiest offerings there : the grain offerings , the offerings for sin , and the guilt offerings .
Once the priests enter the Holy Place , they must not go out of the Holy Place into the outer courtyard until they leave behind the clothes that they wore as they served . These clothes are holy . The priests must put on other clothes . Then they can go into the area that is for the people .
When the man had finished measuring the inner part of the temple area , he led me out through the east gate . Then he measured all the way around the outer area .
He measured the east side with a measuring stick . It was eight hundred and seventy-five feet long according to the measuring stick .
He measured the north side . It was eight hundred and seventy-five feet long according to the measuring stick .
He measured the south side . It was eight hundred and seventy-five feet long according to the measuring stick .
He came around to the west side and measured it . It was eight hundred and seventy-five feet long according to the measuring stick .
He measured all four sides . There was a wall all around it . The wall was eight hundred and seventy-five feet long and eight hundred and seventy-five feet wide . It separated what was holy from what was unholy .
The man took me to the east gate .
I saw the glory of the God of Israel coming from the east . His voice was like the sound of rushing water , and the earth was shining because of his glory .
This vision was like the one I saw when he came to destroy Jerusalem and like the one I saw by the Chebar River . I immediately bowed down .
Jehovah’s glory came into the Temple through the east gate .
The Spirit lifted me and brought me into the inner courtyard . I saw Jehovah’s glory fill the Temple .
I heard someone speaking to me from inside the Temple while the man was standing beside me .
The voice said : » Son of man , this is the place where my throne is and the place where my feet rest . This is where I will live among the Israelites for a very long time . Then the people of Israel and their kings will no longer dishonor my holy name by acting like prostitutes . They will not dishonor it with the dead bodies of their kings .
» They put their doorway by my doorway and their doorposts by my doorposts . Only a wall separated me from them . They dishonored my holy name because of the disgusting things that they have done . So I destroyed them in my anger .
» They must stop acting like prostitutes and take the dead bodies of their kings far away from me . Then I will live among them for a very long time .
» Son of man , describe this Temple to the people of Israel . Then they will be ashamed because of their sins . Let them study the plans .
» Suppose they are ashamed of everything that they have done . Then show them the design of the Temple , its arrangements , its exits and entrances-its entire design . Tell them about all its rules and regulations . Then write these things down for them so that they can remember its design and follow all its rules .
» This is a regulation of the Temple : The whole area all the way around the top of the mountain is most holy . Indeed , this is a regulation of the Temple .
» These are the measurements of the altar , using royal measurements . The royal measuring stick was twenty-one inches long . The base of the altar was twenty-one inches high and twenty-one inches wide . All around the edge of the altar was a rim measuring nine inches wide . This was the height of the altar :
» From the base on the ground to the lower ledge it was three and one half feet high , and from the lower ledge to the upper ledge it was seven feet high and twenty-one inches wide .
» The place where the sacrifices were burned was seven feet high . There were four horns above it .
» It was twenty-one feet square , wide and long .
» The upper ledge was also square . It was twenty-four and one half feet long and twenty-four and one half feet wide . It had a rim all the way around that was ten and one half inches wide . Its base was twenty-one inches . » The steps to the altar faced east . «
The man said : » Son of man , this is what the Lord Jehovah says : ‘ These are the rules for sacrificing burnt offerings and for sprinkling blood on the altar after the altar is built . ’
» ‘ Jehovah said : ‘ Give a young bull to the priests as an offering for sin . These priests are Zadok's descendants . They are men from the tribe of Levi , who can come near me and serve me .
» ‘ Take some of the bull's blood , and put it on the altars four horns , on the four corners of the ledge , and on the rim all the way around the altar . When you do this , you will remove sin from the altar and make peace with Jehovah .
» ‘ Take a young bull as an offering for sin , and burn it in the place appointed near the temple , outside the holy place .
» ‘ On the second day bring a male goat that has no defects as an offering for sin . Remove sin from the altar as you did with the young bull . ’
» ‘ When you finish removing sin offer a young bull and a ram that have no defects .
» ‘ Offer them to Jehovah . The priests must throw salt on them and offer them as burnt offerings to Jehovah .
» ‘ Every day for seven days you must sacrifice a goat , a young bull , and a ram from the flock as an offering for sin . They must be animals that have no defects .
» ‘ For seven days the priests should pay compensation for wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah at the altar , purify it , and consecrate it .
» ‘ When those days are over , on the eighth day , the priests must sacrifice burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar . Then I will accept them , ’ ’ declares the Lord Jehovah . «
The man took me back to the outer east gate of the Holy Place , and the gate was shut .
Jehovah said to me : » This gate will stay shut and will not be opened . No one may enter through it because the Lord Jehovah of Israel entered through it . It must be kept shut .
» Only the prince may sit there and eat food in the presence of Jehovah . He will enter through the entrance hall of the gateway and leave the same way . «
The man brought me through the north gate in front of the Temple . When I looked , I saw Jehovah’s Temple was filled with Jehovah’s glory . At once I bowed down .
Jehovah said to me : » Son of man , pay close attention . Look , and listen to everything I tell you . Listen to all the rules and regulations for Jehovah’s Temple . Pay close attention to everyone who enters the Temple and leaves from the Holy Place .
» ‘ Tell the rebellious people of Israel : ‘ This is what the Lord Jehovah says : I have had enough of all the disgusting things that you have done , people of Israel .
» ‘ You brought godless foreigners into my holy place . You dishonored my temple when you offered fat and blood to me . You rejected my promise so that you could do all your disgusting things .
» ‘ You did not take care of my holy things . You put foreigners in charge of my Temple ! « ’
» ‘ The Lord Jehovah says : » No foreigner uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh , of all the foreigners who are among the sons of Israel , shall enter my sanctuary . « ’
» ‘ But the Levites , who went far from me when Israel went astray , who went astray from me after their idols , will bear the punishment for their iniquity .
» ‘ They will be ministers in my sanctuary and having oversight at the gates of the house . They will slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people , and they will stand before them to minister to them .
» ‘ I have sworn against them because they ministered to them before their idols and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel , ’ ’ declares the Lord Jehovah . ‘ They will bear the punishment for their iniquity . ’
» ‘ They will not serve as a priest to me , nor come near to any of my holy things , to the things that are most holy . They will bear their shame for their abominations that they have committed .
» ‘ Even so I will appoint them to keep charge of the house , of all its service and of all that will be done in it . ’
» ‘ But the Levitical priests , the sons of Zadok , who kept charge of my sanctuary when the sons of Israel went astray from me , shall come near to me to minister to me . They shall stand before me to offer me the fat and the blood , declares the Lord Jehovah .
» ‘ They will enter my sanctuary and come near my table to minister to me and keep my charge .
» ‘ They must wear linen clothes when they enter the gateways to the inner courtyard . They must have no wool on them while they serve in the gateways to the inner courtyard and in the Temple .
» ‘ They must wear linen turbans on their heads and linen undergarments . They must not wear anything that makes them sweat .
» ‘ When they go out among the people in the outer courtyard , they must take off the clothes that they wore as they served . They must leave their clothes in the side rooms of the holy place and put on other clothes so that they do not transfer the holiness from their clothes to the people .
» ‘ They must not shave their heads or let their hair grow long . They must keep the hair on their heads trimmed .
» ‘ None of the priests may drink wine when they enter the inner courtyard .
» ‘ They must not marry widows or women who have been divorced . They may marry only virgins from the nation of Israel or widows of priests . ’
» ‘ They must teach my people the difference between what is holy and what is unholy . They must show the people how to tell the difference between what is clean and what is unclean .
» ‘ In all disputes the priests must act as judges and make decisions based on my Laws . They must obey my rules and my regulations at all my festivals . They must observe holy days to worship me .
» ‘ A priest must not make himself unclean by going near a dead body . But a priest may become unclean if the dead person is his father , mother , son , daughter , brother , or unmarried sister .
» ‘ After a priest is made clean , he must wait seven days .
» ‘ When he enters the inner courtyard of the holy place to serve in the holy place , he must bring his offering for sin , declares the Lord Jehovah .
» ‘ The priests will have no inheritance . I am their inheritance . Do not give them any possessions in Israel . The priests belong to me .
» ‘ They will eat grain offerings , offerings for sin , and guilt offerings . Everything in Israel that is devoted to Jehovah will belong to them .
» ‘ The priests should have the best of all the first ripened fruits . The best of every gift from all your contributions must go to the priests . The best of your dough must go to the priests . This will cause a blessing to rest on your home .
» ‘ The priests must never eat any bird or animal that has died naturally or was killed by other wild animals . ’
» ‘ Divide the land by drawing lots for the property you will inherit . Set aside an area forty-three thousand seven hundred and fifty feet long and thirty-five thousand feet wide for Jehovah . The entire area will be holy .
» ‘ An area of eight hundred and seventy-five feet square will be for the holy place with an open area eighty-seven and one half feet wide .
» ‘ Measure off an area forty-three thousand seven hundred and fifty feet long and seventeen thousand five hundred feet wide . The Holy Place , that is , the Most Holy Place , will be in this area .
» ‘ This holy part of the land will belong to the priests who serve in the Holy Place , the priests who come near to serve Jehovah . They will use this place for their homes , and it will be the location for the Holy Place .
» ‘ An area forty-three thousand seven hundred and fifty feet long and seventeen thousand five hundred feet wide will belong to the Levites who serve in the Temple . It will be given to them so that they have cities to live in .
» ‘ You must designate an area eight thousand seven hundred and fifty feet wide and forty-three thousand seven hundred and fifty feet long as the city's property . It will be located alongside the holy area . It will belong to all the people of Israel .
» ‘ The prince will have all the land on both sides of the holy area and on both sides of the property belonging to the city . From the western boundary of the holy area , his land will extend to the Mediterranean Sea . From the eastern boundary of the holy area , his land will extend to the eastern border of the country . His territory will be as large as the territory of one of the tribes .
» ‘ This land will belong to the prince in Israel . Then my princes will no longer oppress my people . They will give land to each tribe of the nation of Israel . ’
» This is what the Lord Jehovah says : ‘ I have had enough of you , you princes of Israel . ’ ’ » ‘ Stop your violence and looting , and do what is fair and right . Stop evicting my people , ’ ’ declares the Lord Jehovah .
» ‘ You must have honest scales and honest dry and liquid measures .
» ‘ The dry and liquid measures must always be the same : The ephah and the bath should hold the same as one-tenth of a homer . The homer must be the standard measure .
» ‘ One shekel must weigh twenty gerahs . One mina must weigh sixty shekels . ’
» ‘ This is the contribution you must give to Jehovah : seventeen percent of your wheat and seventeen percent of your barley .
» ‘ You must give one percent of your olive oil using the standard measure .
» ‘ You must take one sheep out of every two hundred from the well-watered pastures of Israel . You must sacrifice them with grain offerings , burnt offerings , and fellowship offerings to make peace with Jehovah , ’ ’ declares the Lord Jehovah .
» ‘ All the common people must give this contribution to the prince in Israel .
» ‘ Then the prince is responsible to provide burnt offerings , grain offerings , and wine offerings at the annual festivals , the New Moon Festivals , the weekly days of worship , and all the other appointed festivals of the nation of Israel . He must prepare offerings for sin , grain offerings , burnt offerings , and fellowship offerings to pay compensation for wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah for the nation of Israel .
» This is what the Lord Jehovah says : ‘ On the first day of the first month , take a young bull that has no defects and remove sin from the holy place .
» ‘ The priest must take some blood from the offering for sin and put it on the doorposts of the Temple , on the four corners of the ledge of the altar , and on the doorposts of the gateways of the inner courtyard .
» ‘ You must do the same on the seventh day of the month for everyone who unintentionally does something wrong and is unaware of it . So you must pay compensation for wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah for the Temple .
» ‘ On the fourteenth day of the first month , you will celebrate the Passover , a festival lasting seven days when unleavened bread is eaten .
» ‘ At that time the prince must prepare for himself and for all the common people a young bull as an offering for sin .
» ‘ Every day during the seven days of the festival , he must prepare burnt offerings for Jehovah : seven young bulls that have no defects , seven rams that have no defects , and one male goat as an offering for sin .
» ‘ He must also give as a grain offering a half-bushel for each young bull and a half-bushel for each ram . He must also give one gallon of olive oil for every half-bushel of grain .
» ‘ On the fifteenth day of the seventh month , at the Festival of Booths , he must do the same as on those seven days . He must prepare the same offerings for sin , burnt offerings , grain offerings , and olive oil . ’ «
» This is what the Lord Jehovah says : ‘ The east gate of the inner courtyard must be closed during the six working days , but it must be opened on the weekly day of worship . It must also be opened on the New Moon Festival .
» ‘ The prince must enter from the outside through the entrance hall of the gateway . He must stand by the doorposts of the gateway . Then the priests must prepare the prince's burnt offerings and fellowship offerings . He must worship at the entrance of the gateway and then leave . The gate must not be closed until evening .
» ‘ The common people must worship at the door of the gateway in the presence of Jehovah on the weekly days of worship and on New Moon Festivals .
» ‘ The prince must offer to Jehovah six lambs that have no defects and one ram that has no defects as a burnt offering on the day of worship .
» ‘ The grain offering that is to be brought with the ram must be a half-bushel , and the grain offering that is to be brought with the lambs must be whatever the prince can bring . One gallon of olive oil must be brought with each half-bushel of grain .
» ‘ On the first day of the month , the burnt offering must be one young bull , six lambs , and one ram-all animals that have no defects .
» ‘ With each young bull and each ram the offering must include a half-bushel of grain , and with each lamb the offering must be whatever the prince wants to bring . One gallon of olive oil must be offered with each half-bushel of grain .
» ‘ When the prince enters , he must enter through the entrance hall of the gateway . He must enter and leave the same way .
» ‘ The people will enter Jehovah’s presence at the time of the appointed festivals . Those entering through the north gate to worship must leave through the south gate . Those entering through the south gate must leave through the north gate . They must not leave through the same gate they entered . They must leave through the opposite gate .
» ‘ The prince must be among them . When they enter , he must enter . When they leave , he must leave .
On festival days and at appointed festivals , a grain offering of a half-bushel must be brought with each young bull , and a half-bushel must be brought with each ram . But with the lambs , the prince may bring whatever he wants to bring . One gallon of olive oil must be brought with each half-bushel of grain .
» ‘ When the prince prepares a freewill burnt offering , either a burnt offering or a fellowship offering to Jehovah , the east gate must be opened for him . He must sacrifice burnt offerings and fellowship offerings as he does on the day of worship . When he leaves , the gate must be shut after him .
» ‘ Prepare a year-old lamb that has no defects every day as a burnt offering to Jehovah . Do this every morning .
» ‘ Also , prepare a grain offering with it every morning : three-and-a-third quarts of grain and one-and-a-third quarts of olive oil to moisten the flour . It will be a grain offering dedicated to Jehovah . These rules are to be followed always .
» ‘ Prepare the lamb , the grain offering , and the olive oil every morning as a daily burnt offering . ’
» The Lord Jehovah says : ‘ Suppose the prince offers one of his sons a gift from his property . The gift will belong to his descendants because it is their inheritance .
» ‘ Suppose the prince offers a gift from his property to one of his servants . The gift will belong to the servant only until the year of freedom . Then the gift will go back to the prince . Only his sons can inherit his property .
» ‘ The prince must not take any of the people's property . He must not force them to give up their property . He must give his own property as an inheritance to his sons so that none of my people will be separated from their property . ’ «
The man brought me through a passage beside the gateway to the side rooms that faced north . These rooms were reserved for the priests . He showed me a place on the west side of the rooms .
He said to me : » This is the place where the priests must boil the meat for the guilt offering and the offering for sin . This is the place where they must bake grain offerings so that they do not have to bring the offerings into the outer courtyard . This way they will not transfer holiness to the people . «
The man led me to the outer courtyard and took me past the four corners of the courtyard . I saw that in each corner of the courtyard there was a smaller courtyard .
The smaller courtyards that were in each of the four corners of the courtyard were sixty feet long and forty-five feet wide . All four of the smaller courtyards in the corners of the courtyard were the same size .
Around each of the four courtyards were stonewalls , and these walls were equipped with fireplaces .
The man said to me : » These are the kitchens where the Temple servants must boil the people's sacrifices . «
The man took me back to the door of the Temple . I saw water flowing from under the entrance of the Temple toward the east . The Temple faced east . The water was flowing under the south side of the Temple , south of the altar .
Then he led me through the north gate and around to the outer east gate . The water was flowing down the south side of the gate .
With a measuring line in his hand , the man went eastward . He measured off fifteen hundred feet and led me through the water . The water came up to my ankles .
He measured off another fifteen hundred feet and led me through the water . The water came up to my knees . He measured off another fifteen hundred feet and led me through the water . The water came up to my waist .
He measured another fifteen hundred feet . But the water had risen so much that it became a river that I could not cross . The river was too deep to cross except by swimming .
He asked me : » Son of man , do you see this ? «
The man then led me back along the bank of the river . As I went back , I saw many trees on both sides of the river .
He said : » This water flows through the land to the east , down into the Jordan Valley , and into the Dead Sea . When the water flows into the Dead Sea , it will replace the salt water there with fresh water .
» Wherever the river flows , there will be many fish and animals . The river will make the water in the Dead Sea fresh . Wherever the river flows , it will bring life .
» From En Gedi to En Eglaim people will be standing on the shore of the sea with their fishing nets spread out . As many kinds of fish will be there as there are in the Mediterranean Sea .
» But the water in the swamps and marshes will not become fresh . It will remain salty .
» All kinds of fruit trees will grow on both sides of the river . Their leaves will not wither , and they will not fail to produce fruit . Each month they will produce fresh fruit because this water flows from the Holy Place . The fruit will be good food , and the leaves will be used for healing . «
This is what the Lord Jehovah says : » These are the borders of the land that is to be divided among the twelve tribes of Israel . Joseph gets two parts .
» Divide the land equally . I raised my hand and swore that I would give the land to your ancestors . So this land will be your inheritance .
» This is the northern border for the land : On the north side the border will run from the Mediterranean Sea all the way to Hethlon and Hamath Pass . It will run through the city of Zedad and through
» Berothah and Sibraim , which are between the borders of Damascus and Hamath . It will run to Hazer Hatticon , which is on the border of Hauran .
» So the border will run from the Mediterranean Sea to Hazar Enon on the border of Damascus . The border of Hamath will lie to the north . This is the north side .
» On the east side the border will run between Hauran and Damascus . The Jordan River will serve as the border between Gilead and the land of Israel . The border will continue from the Dead Sea down to Tamar . This is the east side .
» On the south side the border will run from Tamar to the oasis at Meribah in Kadesh along the ravine to the Mediterranean Sea . This is the southern border .
» On the west side the Mediterranean Sea is the border up to a point opposite Hamath Pass . This is the west side . «
» Divide this land for each of the tribes of Israel .
» Divide it by drawing lots . This land will be for you . It will also be for the foreign residents who live among you and have given birth to children while they lived with you . Think of them as Israelites . They will draw lots with you for their inheritance among the tribes of Israel .
» Foreign residents will receive their share of the inheritance with the people of the tribe among whom they are living , « declares the Lord Jehovah .
» These are the names of the tribes . Beginning at the northern border , Dan will have one part of the land . It will extend from the road to Hethlon to Hamath Pass and Hazar Enon , on the northern border of Damascus near Hamath , from the eastern border to the western border .
» Asher will have one part of the land and border Dan on the south . It will extend from the eastern border to the western border .

» Reuben will have one part of the land and border Ephraim on the south . It will extend from the eastern border to the western border .
» Judah will have one part of the land and border Reuben on the south . It will extend from the eastern border to the western border .
» The land that you set aside as a special gift for Jehovah will border Judah on the south . It will be forty-three thousand seven hundred and fifty feet wide , and it will be as long as one of the sections of the tribes . It will extend from the eastern border to the western border , and the holy place will be in the middle of it .
» This special land that you set aside for Jehovah will be forty-three thousand seven hundred and fifty feet long and seventeen thousand five hundred feet wide .
» This holy area will belong to the priests . On the north side it will be forty-three thousand seven hundred and fifty feet long . On the west side it will be seventeen thousand five hundred feet wide . On the east side it will be seventeen thousand five hundred feet wide . On the south side it will be forty-three thousand seven hundred and fifty feet long . Jehovah’s holy place will be in the middle of it .
» This land that has been set apart will belong to the priests who are descendants of Zadok . They took care of my holy place . They did not wander away with the Israelites as the Levites did .
» So they will have a special portion from the land . It will be the holiest part of land , next to the land belonging to the Levites .
» Alongside the land belonging to the priests will be the land belonging to the Levites . It will be forty-three thousand seven hundred and fifty feet long and seventeen thousand five hundred feet wide .
» They must not sell any of it or trade any of it . They must not let others have the best part of the land , because the land is Jehovah’s and it is holy .
» A strip of land , eight thousand seven hundred and fifty feet wide by forty-three thousand seven hundred and fifty feet long , will be left for cities , homes , and pastures . The city will be in the middle of it .
» These will be the measurements for the city : On the north side it will be seven thousand eight hundred and seventy-five feet long . On the south side it will be the same length . On the east side it will be seven thousand eight hundred and seventy-five feet wide . And on the west side it will be same width .
» The city's pastureland will be the same on all four sides , four thousand three hundred and seventy-five feet .
» The rest of the land borders the holy area and runs lengthwise . This land will be seventeen thousand five hundred feet on both east and west sides . It will be used to provide food for the city workers .
» City workers from all the tribes in Israel will farm it .
» The whole area will be forty-three thousand seven hundred and fifty feet square . You must give this land as a special gift to Jehovah along with the city property .
» Whatever is left on the east side and west side of the holy area and the city property will belong to the prince . This land will extend eastward from the holy area to the eastern border , and it will extend westward to the western border . Both of these areas are as long as one of the sections of the tribes . These areas belong to the prince , and the holy area with the Holy Place of the Temple will be between them .
» The Levites' property and the city's property will be between the prince's part of the land . What is between Judah's and Benjamin's boundaries will belong to the prince .
» This is what the rest of the tribes will receive : Benjamin will have one part of the land . It will extend from the eastern border to the western border .
» Simeon will have one part of the land and border Benjamin on the south . It will extend from the eastern border to the western border .
» Issachar will have one part of the land and border Simeon on the south . It will extend from the eastern border to the western border .
» Zebulun will have one part of the land and border Issachar on the south . It will extend from the eastern border to the western border .
» Gad will have one part of the land and border Zebulun on the south . It will extend from the eastern border to the western border .
» The southern border of Gad will run south from Tamar to the oasis at Meribah in Kadesh , and it will run along the Brook of Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea .
» This is the land you will divide as your inheritance among the tribes of Israel , and these are their areas , declares the Lord Jehovah .
» These will be the exits for the city : The north side will be seven thousand eight hundred and seventy-five feet long .
» The gates of the city will be named after the tribes of Israel . The three gates on the north side will be Reuben Gate , Judah Gate , and Levi Gate .
» The east side will be seven thousand eight hundred and seventy-five feet long . The three gates on the east side will be Joseph Gate , Benjamin Gate , and Dan Gate .
» The south side will be seven thousand eight hundred and seventy-five feet long . The three gates on the south side will be Simeon Gate , Issachar Gate , and Zebulun Gate .
» The west side will be seven thousand eight hundred and seventy-five feet long . The three gates on the west side will be Gad Gate , Asher Gate , and Naphtali Gate .
» The city will measure about thirty-one thousand five hundred feet all the way around . From then on the city's name will be : Jehovah Is There . «
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked Judah . It was in the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah .
Jehovah allowed Nebuchadnezzar to capture Jehoiakim king of Judah . Nebuchadnezzar carried part of the vessels of the house of God into the Plain of Shinar in Babylon . He brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god .
The king ordered Ashpenaz the chief of his officials to bring in some of the Israelites including some of the royal family and nobles .
These were young people who had no defects . They were good looking and intelligent , with knowledge . They showed wisdom , knowledge , and understanding of science . They had ability to serve in the king's court and were taught the language and literature of the Chaldeans .
The king assigned a daily amount of the king's special rich food for them and also the wine that he drank . They were to be educated for three years . At the end of that time they would serve the king .
Now among these children of Judah were Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah .
The officer in charge gave names to them : To Daniel he gave the name of Belteshazzar . Hananiah was called Shadrach . Mishael was called Meshach and Azariah was named Abednego .
Daniel determined in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king's special food and wine . He requested permission from the officer in charge that he might not defile himself .
God caused the officer in charge to show special favor and kindness to Daniel .
The officer in charge said to Daniel : » I fear my lord the king . He has appointed your food and your drink . Why should he see your faces worse looking than other young people your age ? Would you endanger my head with the king ? «
Daniel answered the officer appointed over Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah :
» Test your servants , please , for ten days . Give them vegetables to eat and water to drink .
» You compare our appearance and the appearance of the young people who eat the king’s special food . Then you deal with us according to what you see . «
So he listened to them and allowed them to prove the matter for ten days .
They looked better when the ten days ended ! They were fairer in appearance and fatter in flesh than the young people who ate the king’s special food .
So the steward took away their special food and wine and gave them vegetables and water .
God gave these young people knowledge , understanding , and wisdom of all types of literature and learning . Daniel had understanding and wisdom in all visions and dreams .
When the appointed time for learning ended the chief officer brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar .
The king interviewed them and found out that none was found to be like Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah . Therefore they served the king .
The king found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his entire realm . This was in every matter of wisdom and understanding .
Daniel continued to the first year of king Cyrus .
It was the second year of his reign . He was troubled and could not sleep . Nebuchadnezzar had dreams and was disturbed by them .
The king summoned the magicians , enchanters conjurers , sorcerers , and the Chaldeans and commanded them to tell the king about his dreams . They came in and stood before the king .
The king said : » I had a dream that troubles me and I want to understand what the dream means . «
The Chaldeans spoke in the Syrian language : » O king , may you live for a very long time . Tell your servants the dream , and we will interpret it . «
The king answered : » I have decided . If you do not make the dream known to me and it’s interpretation you will be cut in pieces , and your houses will be made a dunghill foul smelling pile of rubbish .
» But if you tell me the dream and what it means you will receive gifts and rewards and great honor from me . Therefore tell me the dream and the interpretation of it . «
They answered the second time . They said : » Let the king tell his servants the dream . Then we will tell the interpretation . «
The king responded : » I am certain that you bargain for time , because you see my command is firm .
» If you do not tell me my dream , the law will apply to you . You are stalling by speaking lies to me until I change my requirements . Tell me the dream , and I will know that you can show me the interpretation of it . «
The Chaldeans answered : » There is no man on earth who can do what the king requires . No king , lord , or ruler , has asked such a thing of any magician , or enchanter , or Chaldean .
» It is a rare thing that the king requires . There is no other person who can show it to the king , except the gods , and they do not live with humans . «
This caused the king to be angry . In fact he became furious ! He commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be destroyed .
So the decree was delivered . The wise men were to be executed . They searched for Daniel and his companions to execute them .
Daniel sent an answer tempered with counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the king's guard , who was ordered to execute the wise men of Babylon .
He asked Arioch the king's captain : » Why is the decree so urgent from the king ? « Then Arioch explained it to Daniel .
Daniel made an appointment with the king so he could show the king the interpretation .
Then Daniel went back to his house , and explained everything to Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah , his companions :
that they would request mercies from the God of heaven concerning this secret . And they would request that Daniel and his companions would not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon .
The secret was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night . Daniel praised the God of heaven .
Daniel said : » Praise be the name of God forever and ever , for wisdom and might are his .
» He changes the times and the seasons . He removes kings , and sets up kings ; he gives wisdom to the wise , and knowledge to the discerning .
» He reveals the deep and hidden things . He knows what is in the darkness , and the light dwells with him .
» I thank you , and praise you , O God of my fathers . You have given me wisdom and might . You have made known to me what we desired from you . For you have made known to us the king's situation . «
Therefore Daniel went to Arioch . Arioch was appointed by the king to destroy the wise men of Babylon . Daniel said to him : » Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon . Take me to the king and I will show the king the interpretation . «
Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king and said : » I have found a man of the captive children of Judah who will make the interpretation known to the king . «
The king said to Daniel , who was also called Belteshazzar : » Are you able to tell me about my dream and interpret it ? «
Daniel answered : » Wise men , enchanters , magicians , and soothsayers cannot show the secret the king demanded .
» There is a God in heaven that reveals secrets . He made known to king Nebuchadnezzar what will be in days to come . Your dream and visions are these :
» As for you , O king , your thoughts while you were in bed were about what will happen in the future . He who reveals secrets revealed the future to you .
» Concerning me , this secret is not revealed to me to give me more wisdom than anyone else . It is for the purpose that the interpretation may be made known to the king ; that you may know the thoughts of your mind .
» You , O king , saw a large statue . This statue was in fact very large . It was very bright as it stood before you . Its appearance was awesome .
» The statue had a head of pure gold , chest and arms of silver , its belly and its thighs of brass .
» It had legs of iron and its feet were partly of iron , and partly of clay .
» You watched while a stone was cut out without hands . It struck the statue upon its feet that were of iron and clay , and broke them in pieces .
» The iron , the clay , the brass , the silver , and the gold , broke in pieces together . It became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors . The wind carried them away and no place was found for them . The stone that struck the statue became a great mountain , and filled the whole earth .
» This was the dream ! We will interpret it for the king .
» You , O king , are king of kings , to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom , the power , and the strength , and the glory .
» He gave the children of men , the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens to your hand . He made you the ruler over them all ! You are the head of gold .
» After you another inferior kingdom will arise and another third kingdom of brass , which will rule over all the earth .
» The fourth kingdom will be strong as iron , since iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things . It is iron that crushes all these . It will break in pieces and crush .
» The feet and toes you saw , part of potters' clay , and part of iron will be a divided kingdom . It will have the strength of iron . However , you saw the iron mixed with clay .
» As the toes of the feet were part of iron , and part of clay , so the kingdom will be partly strong , and partly broken .
» The iron mixed with clay will mingle with the seed of men . But they will not adhere to one another . For iron does not stick to clay .
» In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed . Its sovereignty will not be entrusted to another people . It will break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it will stand forever !
» You saw a stone cut out of the mountain without hands . It broke the iron , brass , clay , silver , and the gold to pieces . The great God made known to the king what will happen in the future . The dream is certain , and the interpretation of it is sure . «
King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and worshipped Daniel . He commanded that they present an offering and burn incense to him .
The king spoke to Daniel : » It is true , your God is the God of gods , and the Lord of kings , and a revealer of secrets , seeing you were able to reveal this secret . «
The king made Daniel great ! He gave him many great gifts , and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon . He was appointed chief administrator over all the wise men of Babylon .
Daniel requested that the king appoint Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-nego , over the affairs of the province of Babylon . Daniel sat in the court of the king .
Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold . He set it up in the plain of Dura , the province of Babylon . It was ninety feet tall and nine feet wide .
Then Nebuchadnezzar the king gathered the satraps , deputies , governors , judges , treasurers , counselors , sheriffs , and all the rulers of the provinces . They came to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king set up .
The satraps , deputies , governors , judges , treasurers , counselors , sheriffs , and all the rulers of the provinces were gathered together at the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king set up . They stood before the image .
Then the herald proclaimed : » You are commanded to do this , O peoples , nations , and men of every language .
» When you hear the sound of the horn , flute , harp , zither , pipes bagpipe , and all kinds of music , you must fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king set up .
» Whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into the midst of a blazing furnace . «
When all the peoples heard the sound of the horn , flute , harp , zither , pipes , and all kinds of music , all the peoples , the nations , and the languages , fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king set up .
Some Chaldean Astrologers brought accusation against the Jews .
They said to Nebuchadnezzar the king , » O king , may you live for a very long time .
» You , O king , made a decree , that every man that hears the sound of the horn , flute , harp , zither , pipes , and all kinds of music , shall fall down and worship the golden image .
» Whoever does not fall down and worship , will be thrown into the midst of a blazing furnace .
» The Jews whom you appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon : Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-nego have not listened to you . They do not serve your gods . They do not worship the golden image that you set up . «
Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-nego . They brought these men before the king .
Nebuchadnezzar said to them : » Is it true Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego that you do not serve my god , nor worship the golden image that I set up ?
» Now if you are ready at the time you hear the sound of the horn , flute , harp , zither , pipes , and all kinds of music , to fall down and worship the image that I have made , good ! But if you do not worship it you will be thrown into the midst of a blazing furnace that same hour . What god will be able to rescue you from my hand ? «
Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego answered and said to the king : » O Nebuchadnezzar , we have no need to answer you in this matter .
» If it is so , our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the blazing furnace . He will deliver us out of your hand , O king .
» If not you should know O king that we will not serve your gods . We will not worship the golden image that you set up ! «
Nebuchadnezzar was furious . The expression on his face changed against Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego . He commanded that they heat the furnace seven times more than its required heat .
He commanded the mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , and to throw them into the blazing furnace .
Then these men were bound in their coats , caps and their other garments . They were thrown into the midst of the blazing furnace .
Because of the urgency of the king's commandment and the exceeding hot furnace , the flame of the fire killed the men who delivered Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego .
These three men , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , fell down bound into the midst of the blazing furnace .
Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished . He hurried to speak to his counselors : » Did we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire ? « They answered : » True O king . «
He said : » Look , I see four men walking in the midst of the fire . They are not hurt ! The appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods ! «
Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning blazing furnace . He called out : » Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , you servants of the Most High God come here ! « Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego came out of the fire .
The satraps , deputies , governors , and the king's counselors , being gathered together , saw these men . They saw that the fire had no power upon their bodies . Not a single hair on their head was singed . Neither were their clothes changed and they did not smell like fire .
Nebuchadnezzar said : » Blessed be the God of Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego ! He sent his angel and delivered his servants who trusted in him . They violated the king's command and have yielded their bodies , that they might not serve nor worship any god , except their own God .
» Therefore I decree that the people of any nation or language who say anything against the God of Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , shall be cut into pieces . Their houses shall be made a dunghill . There is no other god that is able to deliver like this . «
The king promoted Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego in the province of Babylon .
» Nebuchadnezzar the king , to all the peoples , nations , and languages , that dwell in all the earth : Peace be multiplied to you .
» It seemed good to me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God has done for me .
» How great are his signs ! How mighty are his wonders ! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom , and his dominion is from generation to generation .
» I , Nebuchadnezzar , was at rest in my house , and active in my palace .
» I saw a dream that made me afraid . When I saw this vision my thoughts troubled me .
» I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon that they might explain the dream to me .
» The magicians , enchanters , Chaldeans , and the soothsayers came to me . I told the dream to them . They did not explain the dream to me .
» Daniel , whose name was Belteshazzar , according to the name of my god , finally came to me . He has the spirit of the holy gods . So I told the dream to him saying :
‘ » O Belteshazzar , master of the magicians , I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and no secret troubles you ! Tell me the visions I have seen in my dream . Give me the interpretation .
‘ » Here are the visions of my head : I saw a tree in the midst of the earth . It was very tall .
» ‘ The tree grew and became strong . Its height reached to heaven . It could be seen from distant parts of the earth .
‘ » The leaves were beautiful and the fruit abundant . In it was food for all . The beasts of the field found shadow under it . The birds of the heavens dwelt in its branches . All flesh was fed by it .
‘ » I saw in the visions of my head : Behold , a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven .
» He cried aloud : ‘ Chop down the tree , and cut off its branches , shake off its leaves , and scatter its fruit . Let the beasts get away from under it , and the fowls from its branches .
‘ » Leave the stump and roots in the earth . Apply to it a band of iron and copper in the tender grass of the field . Let it be wet with the dew of heaven . Let its portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth .
‘ » Let its heart be changed from a man's , and let a beast's heart be given to it . Seven times should pass over it .
‘ » The decision is by the decree of the watchers . The sentence by the word of the holy ones ! It is to the intent that the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men , and gives it to whomever he will , and sets over it the lowest of men . «
‘ » I , king Nebuchadnezzar , have seen this dream and you O Belteshazzar , declare the interpretation ! For all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make the interpretation known to me . You are able for the spirit of the holy gods is in you ! ’
» Then Daniel , whose name was Belteshazzar , was stricken dumb for a while , and his thoughts troubled him . The king said , Belteshazzar , do not let the dream or the interpretation trouble you . Belteshazzar answered : My lord , the dream may be to them that hate you and the interpretation to your adversaries .
‘ » The tree that you saw , which grew , and was strong , whose height reached to heaven , and was seen in the distant parts of the earth ;
whose leaves were beautiful and fruit abundant , and in it was food for all ; under which the beasts of the field dwelt , and upon whose branches the birds of the heavens lived :
It is you O king ! You have grown and become strong . Your greatness has grown , and reaches to heaven . Your dominion is to the end of the earth .
‘ » Since the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven saying : Chop down the tree , and destroy it . Leave the stump and the roots in the earth . With a band of iron and brass leave it in the tender grass of the field and let it be wet with the dew of heaven . Let its portion be with the beasts of the field till seven times pass over it . «
This is the interpretation , O king . It is the decree from the Most High that has come to my lord the king .
You will be driven from men . Your dwelling will be with the beasts of the field . You will eat grass like oxen and will be wet with the dew of heaven . Seven times shall pass over you until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men , and gives it to whomever he will .
» Because they commanded to leave the stump and the roots of the tree your kingdom will be sure to you . After that you will know that the heavens do rule .
» Let my counsel be acceptable to you O King . Stop your sins by being righteous and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor . May there be a lengthening of your prosperity . «
All this happened to king Nebuchadnezzar .
At the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon .
The king spoke : » Is this not great Babylon , which I have built for the royal dwelling-place , by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty ? «
While the word was in the king's mouth a voice came from heaven , saying : » O king Nebuchadnezzar , to you it is spoken : The kingdom is departed from you .
» You will be driven from men . Your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field . You will have to eat grass like bulls . Seven times shall pass over you until you know the Most High rules in the kingdom of men , and gives it to whomever he will . «
That same hour it was fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar . He was driven from men and did eat grass like bulls . His body was wet with the dew of heaven , till his hair grew like eagles' feathers , and his fingernails like birds' claws .
» At the end of the days I , Nebuchadnezzar , lifted up my eyes to heaven and my understanding returned to me . I blessed the Most High and I praised and honored the one who lives forever . His dominion is an everlasting dominion , and his kingdom from generation to generation .
All the inhabitants of the earth are considered as nothing . He does according to his will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of earth . None can stop him , or say to him : ‘ What do you do ? ’
» My understanding returned to me at that time . The glory of my kingdom , my majesty and brightness returned to me . My counselors and my lords came to me . I was established in my kingdom with excellent greatness .
» Now I , Nebuchadnezzar , praise , extol and honor the King of heaven . All his works are truth , and his ways justice . He is able to abase humble subdue those who walk in pride . «
King Belshazzar held a great feast for a thousand of his lords , and drank wine with them .
While he tasted the wine , Belshazzar commanded to bring the gold and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the Temple in Jerusalem . This way the king and his lords , his wives and his concubines , might drink from them .
Then they brought the gold vessels that were taken out of the Temple of the House of God that was at Jerusalem . The king and his lords , his wives and his concubines , drank from them .
They drank wine , and praised the gods of gold , silver , copper , iron , wood , and of stone .
In the same hour the fingers of a man's hand appeared , and wrote above the lamp stand on the plaster of the wall of the king's palace . The king saw the part of the hand that wrote .
Then the king's countenance appearance changed in him . His thoughts troubled him . The joints of his loins were loosed , and his knees struck one against the other .
The king cried aloud to bring in the enchanters , the Chaldeans , and the soothsayers . The king spoke to the wise men of Babylon : » Whoever reads this writing , and shows me the interpretation of it will be clothed with purple , and have a chain of gold about his neck . He will be the third ruler in the kingdom « .
All the king’s wise men came . But they could not read the writing , nor make known to the king the interpretation .
King Belshazzar was greatly troubled , and his appearance changed . His lords were perplexed .
The queen came into the banquet hall . She said : » O king , may you live for a very long time : do not let your thoughts trouble you or change your countenance .
» There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods . In your fathers day , light and understanding and wisdom , like the wisdom of the gods , were found in him . King Nebuchadnezzar , your father , made him master of the magicians , enchanters , Chaldeans , and soothsayers .
» Daniel , whom the king named Belteshazzar , has an excellent spirit , knowledge , and understanding for interpreting dreams , showing of dark sentences , and dissolving doubts . Let Daniel be called , and he will show the interpretation . «
Daniel was brought before the king . The king spoke to Daniel : » Are you that Daniel , one of the exiles of Judah , whom the king my father brought out of Judah ?
» I have heard of you , that the spirit of the gods is in you , and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in you .
» The wise men and the enchanters , have been brought in before me to read this writing , and make known the interpretation of it . But they could not show the interpretation .
» I have heard that you can give interpretations and dissolve doubts . If you can read the writing and make the interpretation known to me you will be clothed with purple , and have a chain of gold about your neck , and will be the third ruler in the kingdom . «
Daniel answered the king : » Keep your gifts and give your rewards to another . I will read the writing to the king , and make known to him the interpretation .
» O you king , the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father the kingdom , and greatness , and glory , and majesty .
» Because of the greatness he gave him , all the peoples , nations , and languages trembled and feared before him . Whom he chose he killed and whom he chose he kept alive . Whom he chose he raised up , and whom he chose he put down .
» But when his heart was lifted up , and his spirit was hardened with pride he dealt proudly . He was deposed from his kingly throne and they took his glory from him :
» He was driven from the sons of men , and his heart was made like the beasts . His dwelling was with the wild donkeys . He was fed with grass like oxen , and his body was wet with the dew of heaven until he knew that the Most High God rules in the kingdom of men , and that he sets up over it whomever he will .
» You his son , O Belshazzar , have not humbled your heart , though you know all this .
» You lifted yourself up against the Lord of heaven . They have brought the vessels of his house before you and your lords , wives and concubines . They drank wine from them . You praise the gods of silver and gold , of copper , iron , wood , and stone , which you do not see , nor hear , nor know . You have not glorified the God whose hand holds your breath and life .
» Then the part of the hand was sent from before him , and this writing was inscribed .
» This is the writing that was inscribed : MENE , MENE , TEKEL , PARSIN .
» This is the interpretation of the thing : MENE ; God has numbered your kingdom , and brought it to an end ;
» TEKEL : you are weighed in the balances , and are found wanting .
» PERES ; your kingdom is divided , and given to the Medes and Persians . «
Then Belshazzar commanded , and they clothed Daniel with purple , and put a chain of gold about his neck , and made proclamation concerning him that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom .
In that night Belshazzar the Chaldean King was slain .
Darius the Mede received the kingdom . He was sixty-two years old .
It pleased Darius to appoint a hundred and twenty governors over the kingdom . They were to be located throughout the whole kingdom .
Three commissioners were placed over them . Daniel was one of the commissioners . These governors were to give account to them so that the king would not suffer loss .
Daniel was distinguished above the other commissioners and the governors because an excellent spirit mind was in him . Therefore the king thought to set him over the whole realm .
Then the commissioners and the governors sought to find a charge against Daniel concerning the kingdom . They could find no charge , nor error , nor fault , for he was faithful .
These men said : » We shall not find any charge against Daniel , unless we find it against him in the Law of his God . «
Then these commissioners and governors assembled before the king , and said : » King Darius , may you live for a very long time . «
» All the governors of the kingdom , the deputies and the governors , the counselors consulted together to establish a royal statute . They made a strong decree , that whoever prays to any god or man for thirty days , except to you , O king , shall be thrown into the den of lions .
» Now , O king , establish the decree by signing the document . That it will not be changed , according to the law of the Medes and Persians , which cannot be altered .
King Darius signed the document for the decree . «
Daniel knew that the decree was signed . He went into his house . His windows were open in his chamber toward Jerusalem . He kneeled upon his knees three times a day , and prayed , and gave thanks before his God , like he did before .
These men assembled together . They found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God .
They approached the king about his decree : » Did you sign a decree stating that every man that shall make petition to any god or man within thirty days , except to you , O king , shall be thrown into the den of lions ? « The king answered : » The thing is true , according to the law of the Medes and Persians , which may not be altered . «
Then they said : » Daniel , who is of the children of the captivity of Judah , does not show you respect , O king , nor the decree that you signed . He offers his prayer three times a day . «
Then the king , when he heard these words , was very displeased with himself . He was determined that Daniel not be delivered to him ; and he labored all day to rescue him .
Then these men assembled before the king and said : » Know , O king that it is a law of the Medes and Persians , that no decree or statute that the king establishes may be changed . «
Then the king commanded , and they brought Daniel , and threw him into the den of lions . The king spoke to Daniel : » Your God whom you serve will deliver you . «
A stone was placed over the mouth of the den . The king sealed it with his own signet , and with the signet of his lords ; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel .
The king went to his palace and did not eat . He refused musical entertainment and he could not sleep .
He arose very early in the morning , and went in haste to the den of lions .
He came near to the den and cried with a lamentable voice to Daniel : » O Daniel , servant of the living God , did the God you serve deliver you from the lion ? «
Daniel said to the king : » O king , may you live for a very long time . «
« My God sent his angel , and shut the lions' mouths . They did not hurt me . I was found innocent before him . I have done no wrong before you , O king . «
The king was very happy . He commanded that they take Daniel out of the den . So Daniel was taken out of the den , and no manner of hurt was found on him , because he trusted in his God .
The king commanded that the men that accused Daniel and had him thrown into the den of lions be thrown into the den of lions . They cast them into the den of lions , their children , and their wives ; and the lions killed them and broke their bones in pieces before they reached the bottom of the den .
Then king Darius wrote to all the peoples , nations , and languages that dwell in all the earth : » Peace is multiplied to you .
» I make a decree , that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble with respect before the God of Daniel . He is the living God , and steadfast forever ! His kingdom will not be destroyed . His dominion will be even unto the end .
» He delivers and rescues , and he works signs and wonders in heaven and on earth , which has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions . «
So Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius , and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian .
Daniel had a dream and visions . He wrote the summery of the dream that came to his mind while he was in bed . It was the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon .
Daniel said : » I saw in my vision by night , the four winds of heaven blew upon the great sea .
» Four great beasts came up from the sea , each different from the other .
» The first was like a LION . It had eagle's wings . I watched till the wings were pulled off . It was lifted up from the earth and made to stand upon two feet like a man . A man's heart and mind was given to it .
» Look , a second beast , like a BEAR . It was raised up on one side . Three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth . They said to it , ‘ Arise and devour much flesh . ’
» I saw another beast . It was like a LEOPARD . It had four wings as a bird on its back . The beast also had four heads . Dominion ruling authority was given to it .
» After this I saw more visions in the night . I saw a FOURTH BEAST terrible and powerful , and exceedingly strong ! It had great iron teeth . It devoured and broke in pieces , and stamped the residue with its feet . It was different from the beasts that came before it . It had ten horns !
» I looked at the horns and another one , a little horn came . This horn had eyes like the eyes of a man . It had a mouth that spoke great domineering boastful things . The three first horns were plucked up roots and all .
» I watched as thrones were placed . The ANCIENT OF DAYS sat on one throne . His clothing was white as snow . His hair was like pure wool . His throne was like fiery flames , and the wheels on it were like burning fire .
» A fiery stream issued from before him . Thousands of thousands ministered to him . Ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him . The judgment was set and the books were opened .
» I paid attention because of the sound of the great boastful words the horn spoke . I watched till the beast was slain , and its body destroyed . It was burned with fire .
» The dominion authority was taken away from the other beasts . Yet their lives were prolonged for a season .
» I saw in the night-visions someone like a SON OF MAN came with the clouds of heaven . He came to the Ancient of Days . They brought him near before him .
» He was given legal power and a kingdom . Out of his glory all the peoples , nations , and languages will serve him . His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away . His kingdom will not be destroyed .
» I , Daniel , was grieved to the center of my being , and the visions in my head troubled me .
I came near to one of them that stood nearby , and asked him the truth concerning all this . So he told me . ‘ HE MADE ME KNOW THE INTERPRETATION OF EVERYTHING .
‘ » These FOUR GREAT BEASTS , ARE FOUR KINGS , that arise out of the earth .
‘ » The holy ones of the Most High will receive the kingdom . They will possess the kingdom forever , even forever and ever . ’
» I desired to know the truth about the fourth beast that was different from the others . This beast was exceeding terrible . It had teeth made of iron . Its claws were made of copper . It devoured , broke in pieces , and stamped what was left with its feet .
» There were ten horns on its head . Three horns fell and another horn came up . The horn that had eyes and a mouth spoke great domineering boastful things . Its appearance was greater than the others .
» I watched that same horn as it made war with the holy ones . It prevailed against defeated them .
» Then the Ancient of Days came , and judgment was given to the holy ones of the Most High , and the time came that the holy ones possessed the kingdom .
» He said : ‘ The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom on earth . It will be different from all other kingdoms . It will devour the entire earth . It will trample it down and break it in pieces .
‘ » The ten horns are ten kings that will arise out of this kingdom ! Another will arise after them . He will be different from the former , and he will subdue three kings .
‘ » He will speak words against the Most High Supreme God and wear down afflict cause great distress the holy ones of the Most High . He will think to change the times and law and will have control until a time and times and half a time . Three and one-half years
‘ » But the judgment shall be set applied and they will take away his power forever .
‘ » The kingdom and dominion , and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be given to the people who are the holy ones of the Most High . His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom ! All dominions legal authorities will serve and obey him . ’
» This is the end of the matter . As for me , Daniel , my thoughts were very troubled . My appearance was changed . I kept the matter in my heart . «
A vision appeared to me , Daniel , in the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar . It appeared after the first vision .
I saw in the vision : I was in Shushan the castle palace , which is in the province of Elam by the River Ulai .
A ram with two horns stood next to the river . The two horns were tall , but one was taller than the other , and the taller one came up last .
I saw the ram pushing westward , and northward , and southward . No beasts could stand before him . Neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand . He did what ever he wanted and boasted about himself .
As I observed a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth . It did not touch the ground . The goat had a notable horn between his eyes .
He approached the ram that had the two horns , which I saw standing next to the river . He charged him with the full fury of his power .
I saw him come close to the ram . He was driven with anger and he struck the ram and broke his two horns . The ram had no power to stand before him . He threw him down to the ground , and trampled upon him . No one could deliver the ram out of his hand .
The he-goat promoted boasted about himself exceedingly . He was strong . The great horn was broken and instead of it there came up four notable horns toward the four winds of heaven .
A little horn cam out of one of them . The little horn became very great , toward the south , and toward the east , and toward the glorious land .
It grew great , even to the host of heaven . It threw down to the ground some of the host and it trampled them .
It magnified itself , even to the prince of the host . It took the continual burnt offering from him and the place of his sanctuary was thrown down .
The host was given over to it together with the continual burnt offering through transgression . It cast down truth to the ground , and whatever it wanted to do and prospered .
Then I heard a holy one speak and another holy one said to it : » How long will the vision be concerning the continual burnt-offering and the transgression that makes desolate to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trampled under foot ? «
He said to me : » Two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings . Then the sanctuary will be cleansed . «
After I , even I Daniel , had seen the vision I sought to understand it . Behold , there appeared before me a man standing .
I heard a man's voice from the banks of the Ulai River . He called to Gabriel : » Make this man understand the vision of the time of the end . «
He came near where I stood . I was afraid and fell to my face . But he said to me : » Understand , O son of man the vision belongs to the time of the end . «
He spoke to me while I was in a deep sleep with my face to the ground . He touched me , and set me upright .
He said : I will make you know what will happen in the final time of indignation for the vision is for the appointed time of the end .
» The ram that you saw that had the two horns symbolizes represents the kings of MEDIA and PERSIA .
» And the rough he-goat is the king of GREECE . The great horn that is between his eyes is the first king .
» As for that which was broken , in the place where four stood up , four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation , but not with his power .
» Toward the end of their kingdom , when the transgressors have reached their fullness , a FIERCE KING will arise who will understand sinister schemes .
» He will be mighty , but not by his own power . He will destroy excessively cause great devistation and will prosper and do anything he wants to do . He will destroy the mighty ones and the holy people .
» Through his policy he will cause deceit to prosper in his hand . He will boast about himself in his heart . In their security they will destroy many . He will even stand up against the prince of princes ; but he will be destroyed without human power .
» The vision told about the evenings and mornings is true : but seal up the vision . It belongs to the future . «
I , Daniel , fainted from exhaustion , and was sick for days . Then I rose up , and did the king's business . I wondered about the vision , but none understood it .
In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus Xerxes , of the lineage of the Medes . He was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans .
It was the first year of his reign . I , Daniel , understood from The Books Holy Scriptures the number of the years in the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah the prophet . It was seventy years since the destruction of Jerusalem .
I looked to Jehovah God to seek by prayer and supplications , with fasting and sackcloth and ashes .
And I prayed to Jehovah my God , and made confession , and said , » Oh , Jehovah , the great and fear-inspiring awesome God , who keeps his covenant and loving kindness for those who love him and keep his commandments .
» We have sinned . We have dealt perversely . We have acted wickedly and have rebelled , even turning aside from your precepts and from your ordinances .
» We have not listened to your servants the prophets who spoke in your name to our kings , our princes , and our fathers , and to all the people of the land .
» O Jehovah , righteousness belongs to you ! Shame belongs to us this day ! To the men of Judah , and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and to all Israel , that are near , and that are far off , through all the countries you have driven them , because of their trespass that they have trespassed against you .
» O Jehovah , to us belongs shame , to our kings , to our princes , and to our fathers , because we have sinned against you .
» To Jehovah our God belong mercies and forgiveness . We have rebelled against him .
» We have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God , to walk in his laws , which he set before us by his servants the prophets .
» Yes , all Israel have transgressed your law and turned aside , that they should not obey your voice . Therefore the curse has been poured out upon us . It is the oath that is written in the Law of Moses the servant of God . We have sinned against you .
» He confirmed his words , which he spoke against us , and against our judges who ruled us . He brought a great evil on us . Nothing under heaven has been done like what was done to Jerusalem .
» As it is written in the Law of Moses , all this evil has come upon us . Yet we have not earnestly requested the favor of Jehovah our God . We should turn from our iniquities , and have discernment in your truth .
» Therefore Jehovah watched over the evil and brought it upon us . Jehovah our God is righteous in all his works . We have not obeyed his voice .
» And now , O Jehovah our God , you brought your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand , and made a name for yourself that day . We have sinned ! We have done wickedly .
» O Jehovah , according to all your righteousness , let your anger , I pray you , be turned away from your city Jerusalem , your holy mountain . Because of our sins , and the iniquities of our fathers , Jerusalem and your people have become a reproach to all those who are round about us .
» Now therefore , O our God , listen to the prayer of your servant , and to his supplications , and cause your face to shine upon your sanctuary that is desolate , for Jehovah’s sake .
» O my God , incline your ear , and hear ! Open your eyes , and behold our desolations and the city that is called by your name . We do not present our supplications before you because of our righteous merits , but according to your many mercies .
» O Jehovah , hear ; O Jehovah , forgive ; O Jehovah , pay attention and act ! Do not delay for your own sake , O my God ! Because your city and your people are called by your name . «
While I was speaking , in prayer , and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel , and presenting my supplication before Jehovah my God for the holy mountain of my God ;
While I was speaking in prayer , the spirit person who looked like a man Gabriel , whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning , was inspired to come quickly and touch me . It was about the time of the evening offering .
He instructed me : » O Daniel , « he said , » I have now come to give you wisdom insight and understanding .
» At the beginning of your supplications the commandment went forth . I came to report to you for you are greatly loved . Consider the matter , and understand the vision .
» Seventy weeks seventy sets of seven time periods are decreed for your people and your holy city , to finish transgression and to make an end of sin , and to make reconciliation for iniquity , and to bring in everlasting righteousness , and to seal up vision and prophecy , and to anoint the most holy .
» Know and discern , that from the utterance of the commandment to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One Messiah , the Leader : there shall be seven weeks , also sixty-two weeks . It shall be built again with a public square and moat , even in terrible times .
» And after the sixty-two weeks the anointed one will be cut off destroyed killed and shall have nothing . The people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary . The end of it shall be by the flood of war and desolations .
» He will make a firm covenant with many for one week time period of seven . In the middle of the week he will cause the sacrifice and the offerings to cease . The one that makes desolate will come upon the wing of abominations . At the end that which is decreed will be poured out upon the one lying desolate . «
In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a matter was revealed to Daniel . Daniels name was also Belteshazzar . The matter was true . There was a great military movement . He understood the matter . He also understood the vision .
In those days I , Daniel , was mourning three whole weeks .
I ate no pleasant bread ; neither flesh nor wine entered my mouth . I did not anoint myself at all until three whole weeks were completed .
I was on the shore of the great river , Hiddekel Tigris River on the twenty-fourth day of the first month .
I looked up to see a man clothed in linen . His loins were girded with pure gold of the Uphaz region .
His body also was like chrysolite and his face as the appearance of lightning . His eyes were like flaming torches and his arms and his feet like burnished copper . The sound of his words was like the sound of a crowd .
I , Daniel , saw the vision alone , for the men that were with me did not see the vision . A great quaking fell upon them and they ran away to hide .
I was left alone , and saw this great vision , and there remained no strength in me . My appearance turned deathlike pallor livid pale and I had no strength .
Yet I heard the sound of his words . When I heard the sound of his words I fell with my face toward the ground into a deep sleep .
A hand touched me and set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands .
He said to me : » O Daniel , you are greatly loved , understand the words that I speak to you . Stand upright for I have been sent to you . « When he spoke these words I stood trembling .
Then he said : » Do not fear Daniel ! From the first day that you set your heart to understand , and to humble yourself before your God , your words were heard . I have come in response to your prayer .
» The prince of the kingdom of Persia opposed me twenty-one days but lo , Michael , one of the chief princes , came to help me , and I remained there with the kings of Persia .
» Now I have come to make you understand what will happen to your people in the future for the vision is yet for many days . «
When he spoke these words to me I looked to the ground and was unable to speak .
Then one who looked like a human touched my lips . Then I opened my mouth , and spoke to him : » O my lord , by reason of the vision I have convulsions and I have no strength .
» For how can the servant of my lord talk ? I had no strength in me . I was also without breath . «
Then the one with the human appearance touched me and he strengthened me .
He said , » O man greatly beloved , do not fear , peace be to you , be strong , yes , be strong . « And when he spoke to me , I was strengthened , and said , » Let my lord speak for you have strengthened me . «
Then he said : » Do you know why I have come to you ? Now I will return to fight with the prince of Persia . The prince of Greece will also come .
» But I will tell you what is inscribed in the writing of truth . There is no one standing firmly with me against these , but Michael your prince . «
» I stood up to confirm and strengthen Darius the Mede in his first year .
» Now I will tell you the truth . Look , there will be three more kings in Persia . Then the fourth will be richer than the others . When he is strong because of his riches he will stir up everyone against the kingdom of Greece .
» A mighty king will stand up and rule with great dominion , and do according to his will .
» After he appears his kingdom will be broken . It will be divided toward the four winds of heaven , but not to his posterity , nor according to his dominion as he ruled . His kingdom will be plucked up , even for others besides these .
» The king of the south will be strong along with one of his princes . His prince will be stronger than him , and have dominion . His dominion will be a great dominion .
» At the end of years they will become allies form an allience . The daughter of the king of the south will come to the king of the north to make an agreement . But she will not retain the strength of her arm power ; neither will he stand , nor his arm power ; but she will be given up , and they that brought her , and he that begat her , and he that strengthened her in those times .
» But out of a shoot from her roots will one stand up in his place . He will come with the army and enter into the fortress of the king of the north , and will fight against them , and will prevail .
He will carry captive into Egypt their gods , with their molten images , and with their valuable vessels of silver and of gold . He will stand off some years from the king of the north .
» The king of the north will come into the realm of the king of the south , but he will return into his own land .
» And his sons will be warlike and will assemble a multitude of great forces , which will come on , and overflow , and pass through ; and they will return and fight , even to his fortress .
» And the king of the south will be moved with anger , and will come forth and fight with him , even with the king of the north . He will assemble a large army , and the army will be defeated .
» The army will be lifted up , and his heart will be filled with pride . He will cast down tens of thousands , but he will not prevail .
» The king of the north will return , and will set forth an army greater than the former . He will come on at the end of the times with a great army that is well supplied with much equipment .
» In those times there will many who stand up against the king of the south . Also the children of the violent among your people will rebel up to establish the vision , but they will fall .
» So the king of the north will come , and cast up a siege ramp , and capture a well-fortified city . The forces of the south will not stand , neither his chosen people , neither will there be any strength to stand .
» But he that comes against him will do according to his own will , and none will stand against him . He will stand in the glorious land , and in his hand will be destruction .
» And he will be determined to come with the strength of his whole kingdom , and with him equitable conditions . He will perform them . He will give him the daughter of women , to corrupt her ; but she will not stand or be on his side .
» He will turn back to the coastlands and will capture many . However , a prince will cause the reproach offered by him to cease . He will cause his reproach to turn upon him .
» Then he will turn his attention toward the fortresses of his own land ; but he shall stumble and fall , and will not be found .
» Then one will stand up in his place who will send an oppressor tax collecter to pass through the glory of the kingdom . However , he will be destroyed within a few days , neither in anger , nor in battle .
» A contemptible person will stand in his place . He will be one whom they had not given the honor of the kingdom . He will come in time of security , and will obtain the kingdom by flatteries .
» The overwhelming forces will be overwhelmed from before him , and will be broken after the prince of the covenant is destroyed .
» And after the alliance made with him he will work deceitfully . He will come up , and will become strong , with a small nation of people .
» In time of security he will come even upon the richest places of the province . He will do that which his fathers have not done , nor his fathers' fathers . He will scatter among them prey , and spoil , and substance . He will devise his devices against the strongholds , even for a time .
» He will stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army . The king of the south will war in battle with an exceeding great and mighty army , but he will not stand . This is because they will devise schemes against him .
» Those who eat of his rich foods will destroy him . His army will overflow and many will fall down slain .
» And as for both these kings , their hearts will be inclined to do bad things . They will speak lies at one table and nothing will succeed . The end will come at the time appointed .
» Then king of the north will return to his land with great wealth . His heart will be against the holy covenant . He will do what he pleases and return to his own land .
» At the time appointed he will invade the south again . But the outcome will not be the same as it was at the earlier time .
» For ships of Kittim will come against him . He will be grieved and will return . He will have indignation against the holy covenant and will do what he pleases . He will even return , and show favor to those who forsake the holy covenant .
» His armed forces will stand with him , and they will profane the sanctuary , even the fortress , and will take away the continual burnt offering . They will set up the abomination that makes desolate .
» Those who act wickedly against the covenant will be perverted by flatteries . However , the people who know their God will be strong and act effectively .
» Those who are wise among the people will instruct many . Yet they will fall by the sword and by flame , by captivity and by spoil , for many days .
» When they fall , they will be helped with a little help ; but many will join them in their flatteries .
» Some of them who are wise have insight will fall . This will refine them , and purify them , and make them clean , even to the time of the end , because it is yet for the time appointed .
» The king will do according to his will . He will exalt himself , and magnify himself above every god . He will speak horrable atrocious things against the God of gods . He will be successful until the indignation is accomplished for that which is determined will be done .
» Neither will he honor the gods of his father’s , nor the desire of women , nor regard any god for he will magnify himself above them all .
» He will honor the god of military fortresses , a god whom his fathers did not know . He will honor with gold , and silver , and with precious stones , and expensive gifts .
» He will deal with the strongest fortresses by the help of a foreign god . Whoever acknowledges him will increase with glory . He will make them rulers over many , and will divide the land for a price .
» The king of the south will contend with him at the time of the end . The king of the north will come against him like a whirlwind , with chariots , and with horsemen , and with a large fleet of ships . He will enter into the countries and overflow and pass through them .
» He will also invade the glorious land , and many countries will be overthrown . These will be delivered out of his hand : Edom , and Moab , and the chief of the children of Ammon .
» He will stretch forth his power and authority over many countries , and the land of Egypt will not escape .
» He will exercise power over the treasures of gold and of silver , and over all the precious things of Egypt . The Libyans and the Ethiopians will be under his control .
» News from the east and the north will trouble him . He will go forth with great fury to destroy and annihilate many .
» He will plant the tents of his palace dwell in and control between the sea and the glorious holy mountain . But he will come to his end , and none will help him .
» At that time Michael will stand up . He is the great prince who stands for the children of your people . There will be a time of trouble that has not happened since the beginning of nations . Then your people will be delivered , every one whos name is found written in the book .
» Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake , some to everlasting life , and some to shame and everlasting contempt .
» Those who have wisdom insight will shine like the brightness of the firmament . They turn many to righteousness , like the stars forever and ever .
» But you , O Daniel , keep the words secret , and seal the book until the time of the end . Many will run back and forth and knowledge will increase . «
Then I , Daniel , looked , and , behold , there stood two others , one on the bank of the river on this side , and the other on the bank of the river on that side .
One said to the man clothed in linen , which was above the waters of the river : » How long will it be to the end of these wonders ? «
I heard the man clothed in linen , when he held up his right hand and his left hand to heaven , and swore by him that lives forever : » It will be for three and one half years ; and when they have made an end of breaking in pieces the power of the holy people , all these things will be finished . «
I heard but I did not understand . I said : » O my lord , how will this all end ? «
He replied : » Go your way , Daniel for the words are kept secret and sealed till the time of the end .
» Many will purify themselves , and make themselves white , and be refined . The wicked will do wickedly and none of the wicked will understand . Those who are wise will understand !
» From the time that the continual burnt offering will be taken away , and the abomination that makes desolate set up , there will be a thousand and two hundred and ninety days .
» Blessed is he who waits and comes to the thousand three hundred and thirty five days .
» Go toward the end , for you will enter into rest . Then you will rise for your determined condition in life at the end of the days . «
The word of Jehovah that came to Hosea the son of Beeri , in the days of Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah , and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash , king of Israel .
When Jehovah first spoke through Hosea , Jehovah said to Hosea , » Go and marry an adulterous wife and have children with her for the land commits flagrant adultery . They have abandoned Jehovah . «
So he took as his wife Gomer the daughter of Diblaim . She conceived , and gave birth to a son .
Jehovah said to Hosea : » Name him Jezreel . In a little while I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu . I will cause the kingdom of Israel to cease .
» It will happen that I will break the bow strength of Israel in the valley of Jezrell . «
Gomer conceived again , and gave birth to a daughter . Jehovah said to Hosea : » Name her Loruhamah for I will no longer have mercy upon the house of Israel and I will not pardon them .
» However I will have mercy compassion love on the house of Judah . I will not save them by bow , or by sword . I will not save them by battle , not by horses , nor by horsemen . However , I will save them by Jehovah their God . «
Now when she had weaned Loruhamah , Gomer conceived , and gave birth to another son .
Jehovah said : » Name him Loammi for you are not my people , and I am not your God .
» Yet the number of the children of Israel will be like the grains of the sand of the sea , which cannot be measured or numbered . It will be said : You are the sons of the living God in the place where it was said you are not my people !
» The children of Judah and the children of Israel will be gathered together . They will appoint for themselves one leader , and will leave the land of Jezreel . It will be a great day for Jezreel . «
» Say to your brothers : ‘ My people . ’ ’ Say to your sisters : ‘ You have been shown loving kindness . ’
» Plead with your mother your nation , for she is not my wife , neither am I her husband . Let her put away her acts of adultery from her face , and her adulteries from between her breasts !
» I will strip her naked and make her as in the day that she was born . I will make her as a wilderness , and make her like a dry land , and kill her with thirst .
» I will show no mercy to her children for they are children of fornication .
Their mother played the harlot . She that conceived them acted shamefully ! For she said , I will go after my lovers , who give me my bread and my water , my wool and my flax , my oil and my drink .
» Behold , I Jehovah will fence her way with thorns . I will build a wall against her that she will not find her path .
» She will follow after her lovers but she will not reach them . She will seek them , but will not find them ! She will say : ‘ I will return to my first husband for it was better for me then . ’
» She did not know that I gave her the grain , the new wine and oil , and multiplied her silver and gold , which they used for Baal .
» Therefore I will take back my grain at that time , and my new wine in the season . I will pluck away my wool and my flax that should have covered her nakedness .
» Now I will uncover her lewdness obscene behavior in the sight of her lovers , and none will deliver her out of my hands .
» I will also cause all her exaltation to cease , her feasts , her new moons , and her Sabbaths , and all her solemn assemblies .
» I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees . Of this she said : These are my loose woman’s hire that my lovers have given me . I will make them a forest , and the beasts of the field will eat them .
» I will punish her for the days in which she burned incense to the Baals , when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels , and went after her lovers , and forgot me , « said Jehovah .
» Therefore , behold , I will entice her into the wilderness , and speak kindly to her .
» I will give her vineyards from there and the valley of Achor for a door of hope . She will sing there as in the days of her youth and in the day when she came up out of Egypt .
» It will be at that day , « said Jehovah ; » you will call me ‘ husband ’ ’ Ishi . You will no longer call me my ‘ master ’ ’ ba ’ ali .
» For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth , and they will no more be mentioned by their name .
» At that time I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field , and with the birds of the heavens , and with the creeping things of the ground . I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the land , and will make them lie down in safety .
» I will engage you to me for a very long time ! Yes I will engage you to me in righteousness , and in justice , and in loving kindness , and in mercies .
» I will even engage you to me in faithfulness . Then you will know Jehovah .
» It will happen in that day . I will answer , « said Jehovah , » I will answer the heavens , and they will answer the earth !
» The earth will answer the grain , and the new wine , and the oil ; and they will answer Jezreel .
» And I will sow her to me in the earth ! I will have mercy compassion on her who had not obtained mercy . I will say to those who were not my people : ‘ You are my people ! ’ ’ They will answer : ‘ You are my God ! ’ «
Jehovah said to me : » Go again and love a woman beloved by her friend . Love an adulteress , even as Jehovah loves the children of Israel . Though they turn to other gods , and love cakes of raisins for feasts . «
So I bought her for fifteen pieces of silver , and a homer of barley , and a half-homer of barley .
I said to her : » You will live with me many days . You must not play the harlot commit fornication and you must not be any man’s wife . I will also be with you . «
For the children of Israel will live many days without king , without prince , without sacrifice , without pillar , and without ephod or teraphim .
Afterward the children of Israel will return and seek Jehovah their God . David their king will come with trembling to Jehovah and to his goodness in the last days .
Hear the word of Jehovah , you children of Israel ! For Jehovah has a legal case against the inhabitants of the land . There is no truth ! There is no goodness . There is no knowledge of God in the land .
They do nothing but swear , deceive , kill , steal and commit adultery ! There is violence and bloodshed in the land .
Therefore the land will mourn . All the inhabitants are weak . The beasts of the field , the birds of the heavens and the fish of the sea will also perish .
Let no man find fault and let no man reprove . After all your people are the ones who debate argue with a priest .
You will stumble in the day , and the prophet will stumble with you in the night . I will destroy your mother .
My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge . Because you have rejected knowledge , I will also reject you ! You will not be a priest to me since you have forgotten the Law of your God . Therefore , I will forget your children .
They grew in number and sinned against me . I will change their glory into shame .
They feed on the sins of my people , and set their heart on their iniquity .
It will be like people , like the priests . I will punish them for their ways , and will repay them for their actions .
They will eat , and not have enough ! They will play the harlot , and will not increase ! They do not listen to Jehovah .
Prostitution , wine and new wine take away the understanding .
My people ask counsel at their stock , and their staff declares to them ; for the spirit of adultery caused them to go astray . They have played the harlot , departing from their God .
They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains ! They burn incense upon the hills , under oaks and poplars storax and the strong tree , because it has good shade . Your daughters play the harlot , and your brides commit adultery .
I will not punish your daughters when they play the harlot , nor your brides when they commit adultery . The men go out with harlots , and they sacrifice with the prostitutes . The people that do not understand will fall be overthrown .
Though you , Israel , play the harlot , do not let Judah become guilty ! Do not go to Gilgal , neither go to Bethaven , nor swear , » As Jehovah lives . «
For Israel behaved stubbornly like a stubborn heifer . Will Jehovah now feed them as a lamb in a large place .
Ephraim is joined to idols . Leave him alone .
Their drink wheat beer has become sour . They play the harlot continually . Her rulers dearly love shame .
The wind wrapped her up in its wings . They will be put to shame because of their sacrifices !
» Hear this , O you priests and pay attention , O house of Israel . Give ear listen ! O house of the king the judgment is about you . You have been a snare at Mizpah and a net spread upon Tabor .
» The rebels are eager to kill . I will correct them all .
» I know Ephraim , and Israel is not hid from me . O Ephraim , you have played the harlot and Israel is defiled .
» They will not consecrate their deeds to their God because the spirit of fornication is in them . They do not know Jehovah .
» The pride of Israel testifies about them . Therefore Israel and Ephraim will stumble in their iniquity . Judah will also stumble with them .
» They will go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Jehovah . But they will not find him . He has withdrawn from them .
» They have dealt treacherously against Jehovah ! They have borne strange children : now the new moon will devour them with their fields .
» Blow the horn in Gibeah , and the trumpet in Ramah : sound an alarm at Bethaven behind you , O Benjamin .
» Ephraim will become desolation in the day of rebuke among the tribes of Israel . I made known that which will surely be .
» The princes of Judah are like them that remove the landmark . I will pour my wrath upon them like water .
» Ephraim is oppressed . He is crushed in judgment because he was content to walk after man's command .
» I am like a moth to Ephraim and to the house of Judah as rottenness .
» When Ephraim saw his sickness , and Judah saw his wound , Ephraim went to Assyria and sent to King Jareb . He is not able to heal you , neither will he cure you of your wound .
» For I will be to Ephraim as a lion . And I will be like a young lion to the house of Judah . I , even I , will tear and go away . I will carry off and there will be none to deliver .
» I will go and return to my place , till they acknowledge their offence , and seek me . They will seek me earnestly in their affliction . «
» Come , and let us return to Jehovah . He has torn us to pieces but he will heal us . He has wounded us but he will bandage us .
» He will revive us after two days . He will raise us up on the third day that we will live before him .
» Let us get to know Jehovah ! Let us press on run after follow to get to know him . As surely as the sun rises he will appear . He will come to us like the winter rains , like the spring rains that water the earth . «
» What can I do with you , Ephraim ? What can I do with you , Judah ? Your love is like the morning mist , like the early dew that disappears .
» Therefore I cut you in pieces by my prophets . I have killed you with the words of my mouth . My judgments flashed like lightning upon you .
» I desire loving-kindness mercy , not sacrifice , and knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings .
» Like Adam , they have broken the covenant . They were unfaithful to me there .
» Gilead is a city of wicked men , stained with blood .
» As marauders lie in ambush for a man , so do bands of priests . They murder on the road to Shechem , committing shameful crimes .
» I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel . There Ephraim is given to prostitution and Israel is defiled .
» Also for you , O Judah , a harvest is appointed . «
» When I want to heal my people Israel and make them prosperous again , all I can see is their wickedness and the evil deeds of Samaria . They cheat one another . They break into houses and steal . They actually rob people in the streets .
» It never enters their hearts that I will remember all this evil . But their sins surround them , and I cannot avoid seeing them .
» They make kings happy with the wicked things they do . They make officials happy with the lies they tell .
» They all commit adultery . They are like a heated oven , an oven so hot that a baker does not have to fan its flames when he makes bread .
» On the day of the king's celebration , the officials become drunk from the heat of wine , and the king joins mockers .
» They become hot inside like an oven while they lie in ambush . All night long their anger smolders , but in the morning it burns like a raging fire .
» They are all as hot as an oven . They consume their rulers like a fire . All their kings die in battle , and none of them calls to me .
» Ephraim mixes with other nations . Ephraim , you are like a half-baked loaf of bread .
» Foreigners are using up your strength , but you do not realize it . You have become a gray-haired , old man , but you do not realize it .
» Israel , your arrogance testifies against you . Even after all this , you do not return to Jehovah your God or look to him for help .
» Ephraim , you are like a simpleminded , senseless dove . You call to Egypt and run to Assyria for help .
» When you go , I will spread my net over you . I will snatch you out of the air like a bird . I will punish you for all the evil things you have done .
» Woe to them , for they have strayed from me ! Destruction is theirs , for they have rebelled against me ! I would redeem them , but they speak lies against me .
» And they do not cry to me from their heart when they wail on their beds . For the sake of grain and new wine they assemble , but they turn away from me .
» Although I trained disciplined and strengthened their arms might power , yet they devise evil against me .
» They do not turn upward to God . They are like a loose bow . Their princes will fall by the sword because of the insolence of their tongue . This will be their derision in the land of Egypt . «
» Sound the alarm on the trumpet . The enemy swoops down on Jehovah’s Temple like an eagle . The people of Israel have rejected my covenant promise and rebelled against my Law .
» Israel cries out to me : ‘ We know you as our God . ’
» However , they have rejected what is good . The enemy will pursue them .
» They chose their own kings . I did not approve . They chose their own princes . Princes I did not know . They made idols with their own silver and gold . Because of this , they will be destroyed !
» Get rid of your calf-shaped idol , Samaria . My anger burns against these people ! How long will they remain unclean ?
» Samaria's calf-shaped idol was made in Israel . Skilled workers made it . It is not God . It will be smashed to pieces !
» The people of Israel plant the wind , but they harvest a storm . A field of grain that does not ripen will never produce any grain . Even if it did produce grain , foreigners would eat it all .
» Israel is swallowed up . It has already mixed in with the other nations . It has become worthless .
The people of Israel went to Assyria . They were like wild donkeys wandering off alone . The people of Ephraim sold themselves to their lovers .
» Even though they sold themselves among the nations , I will gather them now . They will suffer for a while under the burdens of kings and princes .
» The more altars that the people of Ephraim build to make offerings to pay for their sins , the more places they have for sinning .
» I have written many rules for them in my Law , but they consider these things strange and foreign .
» They offer sacrifices to me and eat the meat of sacrifices , but I , Jehovah , do not accept these sacrifices . Now I will remember their wickedness and punish them because of their sins . They will go back to Egypt .
» The people of Israel have built palaces , and they have forgotten their maker . The people of Judah have built many fortified cities . I will send a fire on their cities and burn down their palaces . «
» O Israel , do not rejoice . Do not celebrate as pagan nations do . You have been unfaithful to your God . You have sold sex on every threshing floor .
» There will not be enough grain to feed people . There will not be enough wine to go around .
» The people of Ephraim will not stay in Jehovah’s land . They will return to Egypt and they will eat unclean food in Assyria .
» They will not pour wine offerings to Jehovah . Their food will only satisfy their hunger . All who eat it will be defiled . It will not be brought as an offering to Jehovah’s Temple .
» What will they do on the day of an appointed festival or on Jehovah’s festival days ?
» Even if they escape without being destroyed , Egypt will capture them and Memphis will bury them . Weeds will grow over their silver treasures . Thorns will grow over their tents .
The time for them to be punished will come . The time for them to pay for their sins will come . When this happens , Israel will know it . They think that prophets are fools and that spiritual people are crazy . They have sinned a lot , and are filled with hostility . «
Prophets are God’s watchmen over Ephraim . Yet , traps are set on every prophet’s path and people are hostile in the Temple of their God .
They have gone deep in depravity as in the days of Gibeah . He will remember their iniquity . He will punish their sins .
» I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness . I saw your forefathers as the earliest fruit on the fig tree in its first season . They came to Baal-peor and devoted themselves to shame . They became as detestable as that which they loved .
» As for Ephraim , their glory will fly away like a bird : No birth , no pregnancy and no conception !
» Though they bring up their children , yet I will bereave them until no man is left . Yes , woe to them even when I depart from them !
» I have seen Ephraim planted in a pleasant meadow like Tyre . But Ephraim will bring out his children for slaughter . «
Give them , O Jehovah what will you give ? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts .
» All Ephraim's wickedness began in Gilgal . I hated the people there . I will force them out of my Temple because of their wickedness . I will not love them anymore . All their officials are rebellious .
» The people of Ephraim are like sick plants . Their roots are dried up . They have no fruit . Even if they were to have children , I would kill their dear children . «
My God will reject them because they refused to listen to him . They will wander among the nations .
» The people of Israel were like a grapevine that used to produce grapes . The more prosperous they were , the more altars they built . The more productive their land was , the more beautiful they made the sacred stone pillars they worship .
» The peoples hearts are deceitful . They must suffer for their sins . Jehovah will break down their altars and destroy their sacred pillars .
» These people will soon say : ‘ We have no king because we did not respect Jehovah . What could a king do for us anyway ? ’
» They utter empty words and make false promises and useless treaties . Justice has become injustice , growing like poisonous weeds in a plowed field .
» The people who live in the city of Samaria will be afraid and will mourn the loss of the gold bull at Bethaven . They and the priests who serve the idol will weep over it . They will wail when it is stripped of its golden splendor .
» The idol will be carried off to Assyria as tribute to the great emperor . The people of Israel will be disgraced and put to shame because of the advice they followed .
» They and their king will be carried off , like a chip of wood on water .
» The hilltop shrines of Bethaven , where the people of Israel worship idols , will be destroyed . Thorns and weeds will grow up over their altars . The people will call out to the mountains : ‘ Hide us ! And to the hills , cover us ! ’
Jehovah says : » The people of Israel have not stopped sinning against me since the time of their sin at Gibeah . So at Gibeah war will catch up with them .
» I will attack this sinful people and punish them . Nations will join together against them , and they will be punished for their many sins .
» Ephraim was once like a well-trained young cow , ready and willing to thresh grain . But I will put a yoke on her beautiful neck and harness her for harder work . I made Judah pull the plow and Jacob pull the harrow .
» I said : Plow new ground for yourselves , plant righteousness , and reap the blessings that your devotion to me will produce . It is time for you to turn to me , Jehovah , and I will come and pour out righteousness on you .
» But instead you plowed evil and harvested unrighteousness . You have eaten the fruit produced by your lies . This is because you trusted in your way and in the large number of your soldiers .
Tumult will come to your people and all your fortresses will be destroyed . It will be like the day when King Shalman destroyed the city of Betharbel house of Arbel in battle and mothers and their children were crushed to death .
» That is what will happen to you , people of Bethel , because of the terrible evil that you have done . As soon as the battle begins , the king of Israel will die . «
» When Israel was a young man , I loved him , and out of Egypt I called my son .
» But the more I called Israel , the further they went from me . They sacrificed to the Baals and they burned incense to images .
» It was I who taught Ephraim to walk . I took them in my arms ; but they did not realize it was I who healed them .
» I led them with cords of human kindness , with ties of love . I lifted the yoke from their neck and bent down to feed them .
» Will they not return to Egypt and will not Assyria rule over them because they refuse to repent ?
» Swords will flash in their cities , destroy the bars of their gates , and put an end to their plans .
» My people are determined to turn apostatize from me . Even if they call to the Most High , he will by no means exalt them .
» How can I give you up , Ephraim ? How can I hand you over , Israel ? How can I treat you like Admah ? How can I make you like Zeboiim ? My heart is changed within me . All my compassion is aroused .
» I will not carry out my fierce anger . I will not turn and devastate Ephraim . I am not man . I am God , the Holy One among you . I will not come against my city in wrath .
» They will follow Jehovah ! He will roar like a lion . When he roars , his children will come trembling from the west .
» They will come trembling like birds from Egypt , like doves from Assyria . I will settle them in their homes , « declares Jehovah .
» Ephraim surrounds me with lies , the house of Israel with deceit . Yet Judah is unruly against God , even against the Holy One who is faithful . «
» The people of Ephraim try to catch the wind and try to chase the east wind all day . They are very dishonest , violent and destructive . They make treaties with Assyria and take olive oil to Egypt .
» Jehovah brings legal charges against Judah and punishes Jacob because of the way their people act . He will pay them back for what they have done .
» Their ancestor Jacob held on to his brother's heel while the two of them were in their mother's womb . When Jacob became a man , he struggled with God .
He struggled with the angel and won . Jacob cried and pleaded with him . Jacob found him at Bethel , and he talked with him there .
» Jehovah is the God of Hosts . Jehovah is the name by which he is remembered .
» Return to your God . Constantly express loving kindness and justice . Always wait with hope in your God .
Jehovah says : » The merchants use dishonest scales . They love to cheat people .
» The people of Ephraim say : We are rich . We have made a fortune . With all this wealth , no one will find us guilty of any sin .
» I am Jehovah your God . I brought you out of Egypt . I will make you live in tents again as you did during your appointed festivals .
» I spoke to the prophets and gave them many visions . I taught lessons through the prophets .
» The people of Gilead are evil . They are worthless . They sacrifice bulls in Gilgal . But their altars will become like piles of rubble beside a plowed field .
» Jacob fled to the country of Syria . Israel worked to get a wife . He took care of sheep to pay for her .
» Jehovah used a prophet to bring the people of Israel out of Egypt . He used a prophet to take care of them .
» The people of Ephraim made Jehovah bitter . He will hold them guilty of murder . Jehovah will pay them back for their insults . «
» When the tribe of Ephraim spoke , people trembled . The people of Ephraim were important in Israel . Then they became guilty of worshiping Baal , so they must die .
» They sin more and more . They make idols from silver for themselves . These idols are skillfully made . All of them are the work of craftsmen . People say this about the Israelites : They offer sacrifices and kiss calf-shaped idols .
» That is why they will be like fog in the morning and like morning dew that disappears quickly . They will be like straw blown away from threshing floors . They will be like smoke rising from chimneys .
» I AM JEHOVAH YOUR GOD . I brought you out of Egypt . You have known no god besides me . There is no savior except me .
» I took care of you in the desert , in a dry land .
» When I fed you , you were full . When you were full , you became arrogant . That is why you forgot me .
» So I will be like a lion . Like a leopard I will wait by the road to ambush you .
» Like a bear that has lost her cubs , I will attack you . I will rip you open . Like a lion I will devour you . Like a wild animal I will tear you apart .
» You are destroying yourself , Israel . You are against me , your helper .
» Where , now , is your king , the one who is supposed to save you ? Where in all your cities are your judges ? You said : ‘ Give us kings and officials ! ’
» I gave you a king when I was angry , and I took him away when I was furious .
» Ephraim's wickedness is on record . The record of the people's sins is safely stored away .
» They have the opportunity to live again , but they are not smart enough to take it . They are like a baby who is about to be born but will not come out of its mother's womb .
» I will ransom them from the power of the grave . I will redeem them from death ! O death , where are your stings plagues ? O grave , where is your destruction devastation ? Compassion will be concealed from my eyes .
» The people of Ephraim have become important among their relatives . However , Jehovah’s scorching wind will come from the east . It will blow out of the desert . Then their springs will run dry , and their wells will dry up . The wind will destroy every precious thing in their storehouses .
» The people of Samaria are guilty as charged because they rebelled against their God . They will be killed in war , their children will be smashed to death , and their pregnant women will be ripped open . «
» Return , O Israel , to Jehovah your God , for you have stumbled because of your iniquity .
» Return to Jehovah and say to him : ‘ Take away all iniquity and receive us graciously , that we may present the fruit young bulls of our lips . ’
» Assyria will not save us and we will not ride on horses . We will not say again : Our god , to the work of our hands . In you the orphan finds mercy .
» I will heal their apostasy ! I will love them freely for my anger has turned away from them .
» I will be like the dew to Israel . He will blossom like the lily and he will take root like the cedars of Lebanon .
» His shoots will sprout and his beauty will be like the olive tree . His fragrance will be like the cedars of Lebanon .
» Those who live in his shadow will raise grain again . They will blossom like the vine . His renown will be like the wine of Lebanon .
» O Ephraim , what more have I to do with idols ? It is I who answer and look after you . I am like a luxuriant cypress and fruit comes from me . «
Let the wise understand these things . Let the discerning know them . For the ways of Jehovah are right . And the righteous will walk in them . But transgressors will stumble in them .
The word of Jehovah that came to Joel the son of Pethuel :
» Hear this , you older men ! Listen all you inhabitants of the land . Did this take place in your days , or in the days of your fathers ?
» Tell your children about it , and let your children tell their children , and their children to each new generation .
» That which the gnawing locust left the swarming locust ate . That which the swarming locust left the creeping locust ate . That which the creeping locust left other locusts ate .
» Awake , you drunkards , and weep ! Wail you drinkers of wine . The sweet wine is removed from your mouth .
» A nation has invaded my land . It is strong and very large . His teeth are the teeth of a lion , and he has the jaw-teeth of a lioness .
» He has laid my vine waste and stripped off the bark of my fig tree . He stripped its branches white and clean and threw it away .
» Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth .
» The meal offering and the drink offering are removed from the house of Jehovah . The priests and Jehovah's ministers mourn .
» The field is laid waste , the land mourns . The grain is destroyed , the new wine dried up , the oil fails .
» Be ashamed you farmers . Cry you vinedressers . The wheat , the barley and the harvest of the field have perished .
» The vine and the fig tree fails . The pomegranate-tree , the palm-tree also , and the apple-tree , even all the trees of the field have dried up . Joy has withered away from the sons of men .
» Gird yourselves with sackcloth , and lament , you priests ! Wail , you ministers of the altar . Come , lie all night in sackcloth you ministers of my God ! The meal offering and the drink offering are withheld from the House of your God .
» Sanctify a fast ! Call a solemn assembly . Gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land to the House of Jehovah your God . Call out to Jehovah .
» Alas for the day ! For the day of Jehovah is near ! Destruction will come from the Almighty !
» Is not the food consumed before our eyes ? Is joy and gladness removed from the House of our God ?
» The seeds rot under dirt clods . The storehouses are desolate . The barns are torn down because the grain has dried up .
» How the beasts groan ! The herds of cattle wander about because they have no pasture . The flocks of sheep suffer .
» I cry to you Jehovah ! For fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness , and the flame burned all the trees of the field .
» Yes , the beasts of the field pant for you . The water brooks are dried up , and fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness . «
Blow the trumpet in Zion ! Sound an alarm in my holy mountain . Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble for the day of Jehovah comes . It is near !
» It is a day of darkness and gloom ! It is a day of clouds and thick darkness ! The dawn spreads upon the mountains . This great and mighty people have never seen anything like this . Nor will it be like this again even to the years of many generations .
» A fire devours before them and behind them a flame burns ! The land is like the Garden of Eden before them , and behind them a desolate wilderness . Yes , none have escaped them .
» Their appearance is like the appearance of horses . They run like horsemen into war .
» Like the noise of chariots they leap on the tops of the mountains . It is like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble . They are a strong people set in battle array .
» At their presence the peoples are in anguish ; all faces are waxed pale .
» They run like mighty men . They climb the wall like men of war . They march every one on his way and do not break their ranks .
» They do not crowd each other . They march every one in his path . They burst through the weapons and do not break ranks .
» They rush to the city . They run on the wall . They climb into the houses . They enter in at the windows like a thief .
» The earth quakes before them . The heavens tremble ! The sun and the moon are darkened , and the stars cease to shine .
» Jehovah speaks before his army . His camp is very great ! He is strong that executes his word . The Day of Jehovah is great and very terrible ! Who can endure it ? «
» Even now , « said Jehovah , » turn to me with all your heart , and with fasting , and with weeping , and with mourning !
» Rip apart your heart , and not your garments . Turn to Jehovah your God ! He is gracious and merciful . He is slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness . He will turn back from doing harm .
» Who knows whether he will turn back , feel regret and leave a blessing behind him , a meal offering and a drink offering to Jehovah your God ?
» Blow the trumpet in Zion , sanctify a fast and call a solemn assembly .
» Gather the people , sanctify the congregation , assemble the elders , gather the children , and those that suck the breasts . Let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber , and the bride out of her closet .
» Let the priests and the ministers of Jehovah weep between the Temple porch and the altar ! Let them say : Spare your people , O Jehovah , and do not give reproach to your heritage . That the nations should rule over them and say among the peoples , ‘ where is their God ? « ’
Jehovah was zealous for his land , and had pity on his people .
Jehovah answered his people : » Behold , I will send you grain , new wine and oil . You will be satisfied with it . I will no more make you a reproach among the nations . «
» I will remove the northern army far from you . I will drive it into a land barren and desolate . Its advance troops into the eastern sea and its rearguard into the western sea . It has done great things so its stench shall arise and its foul smell shall come up .
» Do not fear , O land , be glad and rejoice . Jehovah has done great things .
» Do not be afraid you beasts of the field . The pastures of the wilderness have turned green . The tree bears its fruit . The fig tree and the vine yield their strength .
» Be glad you children of Zion , and rejoice in Jehovah your God ! For he gives you the early rain in just measure , and he causes it to rain , the early rain and the latter rain , in the first month .
» The threshing floors will be full of wheat , and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil .
» I will make up to you the years that the locust has eaten , my great army that I sent among you .
» You will have plenty to eat and be satisfied . You will praise the name of Jehovah your God . He has dealt wondrously with you . My people will never again be put to shame .
» You will know that I am in the midst of Israel , and that I am Jehovah your God ! There is none else and my people shall never be put to shame .
» In the last days I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh . Your sons and your daughters will prophesy . Your old men will dream dreams . Your young men will see visions !
» I will also pour out my Spirit upon the male and female servants in those days .
» I will show wonders in the sky and on the earth : blood , and fire , and pillars of smoke .
» The sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood , before the great and terrible awesome Day of Jehovah comes !
» It will happen that who ever calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved . There will be those on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem that will escape , even among the survivors whom Jehovah calls . «
» Behold ! At that time I will bring back the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem .
» I will gather all nations ! I will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat . And I will execute judgment upon them there for my people and for my heritage , Israel . They have scattered my people among the nations and they have divided up my land .
» They cast lots for my people , and traded a boy for a prostitute , and sold a girl for wine , that they may drink .
» What are you to me , O Tyre , and Sidon , and all the regions of Philistia ? Will you pay recompense compensation to me ? If you pay recompense to me swiftly and speedily , will I return your recompense upon your own head ?
» You have taken my silver and my gold , and have carried my precious treasures into your temples .
» You sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks . You remove them far from their border .
» Behold , I will arouse them out of the place where you sold them and will return your recompense upon your head .
» I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah . And they will sell them to the men of Sheba , to a nation far off : for Jehovah has spoken it .
» Proclaim this among the nations ! Prepare for war ! Stir up the mighty men . Let all the men of war draw near let them come up .
Beat your plowshares into swords , and your pruning hooks into spears ! Let the weak say , I am strong .
» Hurry and come all you nations round about . Gather yourselves there and cause your mighty ones to come down , O Jehovah .
» Let the nations be aroused and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat Jehovah’s Judgment ! I will sit there to judge all the nations round about .
» Thrust in the sickle for the harvest is ripe ! Come and tread for the winepress is full and the vats overflow . Their wickedness is great .
» Multitudes , multitudes in the valley of decision ! The day of Jehovah is near in the valley of decision .
» The sun and the moon are darkened , and the stars diminish their shining .
» Jehovah will roar from Zion , and utter his voice from Jerusalem . The heavens and the earth will shake : but Jehovah will be a refuge to his people , and a stronghold to the children of Israel .
» You will know that I am Jehovah your God , dwelling in Zion my holy mountain . Then Jerusalem will be holy and no strangers will pass through invade her any more .
» It will happen in that day that the mountains will drop sweet wine , and the hills will flow with milk . All the brooks of Judah will flow with water . A fountain will come forth from the house of Jehovah and water the valley of Shittim .
» Egypt will be desolation , and Edom will be a desolate wilderness . This is because of the violence done to the children of Judah , because they have shed innocent blood in their land .
» Judah will abide for a very long time , and Jerusalem from generation to generation .
» I will cleanse forgive their blood guilt that which I have not cleansed . Jehovah dwells in Zion ! «
The words of Amos concerning Israel . He was among the herdsmen of Tekoa in the days of Uzziah king of Judah , and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel . It was two years before the earthquake .
He said : » Jehovah roars from Zion ! He utters his voice from Jerusalem ! The pastures of the shepherds mourn for lack of water . The top of Carmel withers . «
» I will not hold back punishment , « said Jehovah , » For the many transgressions of Damascus . This is because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron .
» I will send fire to the house of Hazael and it will devour the palaces of Ben-hadad .
» I will destroy the lock bar at the gate of Damascus , and annihilate the inhabitant from the valley of Aven . He who holds the scepter imperial authority from the house of Eden and the people of Syria will go into captivity to Kir , « said Jehovah .
Jehovah said : » I will not withdraw punishment from Gaza for they transgressed many times . They captured all the people and delivered them to Edom .
» I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza . It will devour the palaces there .

» I will send fire on the walls of Tyre . It will devour the palaces . «
Jehovah declared : » For three and four transgressions of Edom , I will not withdraw punishment . He pursued his brother with the sword . He showed no compassion but was driven with anger and eternal wrath .
» I will send a fire upon Teman , and it will devour the palaces of Bozrah . «
Jehovah also said : » For the many transgressions of the children of Ammon I will not withdraw the punishment . They have ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead , that they may enlarge their border .

» I will destroy her ruler and government officials along with him , « said Jehovah .

» I will send fire upon Judah and it will devour the fortified buildings of Jerusalem . «
Jehovah said : » I will not withdraw punishment for three sins of Israel , even for four the many transgressions of Israel ! They sold the righteous for silver , and the needy for a pair of shoes .
» They pant after the dust of the earth on the head of lowly meek persons . They reject the humble ! A man and his father have sexual relations with the same maiden , to profane my holy name .
» They lie down beside every altar on clothes taken from indebtedness . In the house of their God they drink the wine they have confiscated .
» Before them I destroyed the Amorite . His height was like the height of the cedars . He was strong like the oaks . Yet I destroyed his fruit from above , and his roots from beneath !
» I brought you out of the land of Egypt . I led you forty years in the desert wilderness , to possess the land of the Amorite .
» I ordained some of your sons for prophets and some of your young men for Nazirites dedicated ones . Is this true , O you children of Israel ? « : said Jehovah .
» But you gave the Nazirites wine to drink , and commanded the prophets , saying : ‘ Do Not Prophesy ! ’
» Consider this , I will weigh you down just as a wagon is weighed down when it is full of grain .
» Flight will perish from the swift ! The strong will not increase his strength . The mighty will not save himself .
» The archer will not stand . The swift of foot will not save himself . The horseman will not deliver himself .
» The courageous among the mighty will run away naked in that day , « said Jehovah .
Hear this word Jehovah spoke against you , O children of Israel ! It is against the whole family that I brought out of the land of Egypt :
» Of all the families of the earth I have chosen known only you . Therefore I will punish you for all your sins .
» Will two walk together , except they cooperate collaborate have an agreement ?
» Will a lion roar in the forest when he has no prey ? Will a young lion cry out from his den if he has captured nothing ?
» Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth , where there is no trap for him ? Will a trap spring up from the ground when nothing at all sprung it ?
» Will the trumpet be blown in a city and the people not be afraid ? Will disaster happen to a city and Jehovah not cause it ?
» The Lord Jehovah will do nothing without revealing his secrets to his servants the prophets .
» The lion has roared . Who will not fear ? The Lord Jehovah has spoken ! Who will not prophesy ? «
» Publish it in the palaces at Ashdod , and in the palaces in the land of Egypt . Proclaim and assemble on the mountains of Samaria , and observe the great trouble and oppression there .
» Those who store up violence and robbery in their dwellings do not know how to do what is right , « declared Jehovah .
The Lord Jehovah spoke these words : » An adversary will surround the land . He will defeat and tear down your defenses . He will plunder your dwellings . «
Jehovah said : » As the shepherd rescues out of the mouth of the lion two legs , or a piece of an ear , so the children of Israel will be rescued . They sit in Samaria on the corner of a couch , and on the silken cushions of a bed .
» Hear and testify against the house of Jacob , « said the Lord Jehovah , the God of Hosts .
» The day that I punish Israel because of her sins I will also punish those at the altars of Bethel ! The horns of the altar will be cut off , and fall to the ground .
» I will strike destroy the winter house and the summer house . The houses of ivory will perish , and the great houses will come to an end , « said Jehovah .
» Hear this word you cows of Bashan who live on the mountain of Samaria . You oppress the poor . You crush the needy . You say to your masters husbands lords , » Bring us drink . «
» The Lord Jehovah has sworn by his holiness that the day will come when they will take you away with meat hooks , and those who remain with fish-hooks .
» You will go out through the holes in the city wall straight before her . You will be thrown into Harmon a place of exile , « said Jehovah .
» Come to Bethel and transgress ! Come to Gilgal and multiply transgression ! Bring your sacrifices every morning and your tithes every three days .
» Offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened . Proclaim freewill-offerings and make them known . This pleases you , O you children of Israel , « said the Lord Jehovah .
» I also gave you cleanness of teeth kept food from your teeth in all your cities and lack of bread in all your places . Yet you have not returned to me , « said Jehovah .
» I withheld rain from you three months before the harvest . I caused it to rain on one city , and caused it not to rain on another city . One received rain . The other did not receive rain and it dried up .
» Two or three cities wandered unto one city to drink water . They were not satisfied and yet you have not returned to me , « said Jehovah .
» I struck you with scorching and mildew . The caterpillar has devoured the multitudes of your gardens , your vineyards , your fig trees and your olive-trees . Yet you have not returned to me , « said Jehovah .
» I sent a plague among you just as I did to Egypt . I killed your young men with the sword and I captured your horses . I made the stench of your camp come up even into your nostrils and yet you have not returned to me , « said Jehovah .
» I overthrew your cities as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah . You were like a burning stick plucked out of the fire . Yet you have not returned to me , « said Jehovah .
» This is what I will do to you , O Israel . Because I will do this to you , prepare to meet your God , O Israel !
» Behold he who formed the mountains and created the wind and declared to man his thoughts , also made the morning darkness and treads upon the high places of the Earth : Jehovah , the God of Hosts , is his name . «
Hear this word that I take up for a cry of sorrow lamentation dirge over you , O house of Israel .
The virgin of Israel has fallen . She will not rise again . She has been thrown down upon her own land . There is none to raise her up .
The Sovereign and Almighty Lord Jehovah declared : » The city that went forth a thousand will have a hundred left , and that which went forth a hundred will have ten left , for the house of Israel . «
Jehovah said to the house of Israel : » Seek me and you will live !
» Do not seek Bethel , nor enter into Gilgal . Do not pass to Beersheba . For Gilgal will surely go into captivity exile , and Bethel will come to nothing .
» Seek Jehovah , and you will live . Lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph , and it will devour , and there will be none to quench it in Bethel .
You who turn justice to wormwood a curse , and cast righteousness down to the earth
seek the creator of the cluster of stars named Pleiades and the star constellation Orion . He turns the shadow of death into morning , and makes the day dark with night . He calls for the waters of the sea , and pours them out upon the face of the earth . Jehovah is his name !
He brings sudden destruction upon the strong . Destruction comes upon the fortress .
You hate the one who reproves in the gate , and abhor him who speaks the truth with integrity .
You impose unfair rent on the poor and defraud a tribute of grain from them . You haave built houses of hewn stone yet you will not live in them . You planted pleasant vineyards , but you will not drink the wine from them .
I know you have many transgressions and your sins are great . You afflict the righteous . You take bribes . You refuse to help the needy at the gate .
The prudent will keep silent for it is an evil time .
» Seek good and not evil , that you may live . Jehovah , the God of Hosts , will be with you , as you have said .
» Hate evil , and love good ! Establish justice in the gate . It may be that Jehovah , the God of Hosts , will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph . «
Listen to Jehovah the God of Hosts , the Almighty : Wailing will be in all the broad ways . They will say in all the streets , » Alas ! Alas ! « They will call the farmer to mourning , and the professional mourner to lamentation and crying .
» All vineyards will lament . For I will pass through your midst , « said Jehovah .
» Woe to you who desire the day of Jehovah ! What will the day of Jehovah mean to you ? It is darkness , and not light .
» Like a man who ran from a lion , and a bear met him ! So he went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall , and a serpent bit him .
» Will the day of Jehovah be darkness with no light ? Will it be very dark , and no brightness in it ?
» I hate , I despise reject your feasts , and I will take no delight in your solemn assemblies .
» Yes , even if you offer me your burnt offerings and meal offerings , I will not accept them . Neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts .
» Take the noise of your songs away from me ! I will not listen to the melody of your harps .
» Justice should roll down as waters and righteousness as a mighty stream .
» Did you bring sacrifices and offerings to me in the wilderness for forty years , O house of Israel ?
» You have carried the tabernacle of your king and the shrine of your images , the star of your god , which you made for yourselves .
» Therefore I will cause you to go into captivity exile beyond Damascus , « said the God of Hosts , whose name is Jehovah .
» Those who are at ease in Zion and are secure in the mountain of Samaria will have trouble . You are the notable men of the foremost nations to whom the house of Israel comes !
» Travel to Calneh and observe . From there go to the great Hamath . Then go down to Gath of the Philistines . Are they better off than these kingdoms ? Is their territory greater than your territory ?
» You put far away the evil day and cause the place of violence to come near .
» You lie on beds of ivory , and stretch on couches . You eat the the best lambs out of the flock and the fattest calves out of the stall .
» You sing idle songs to the sound of the harp and like David you improvise on musical instruments .
» You drink wine in bowls , and anoint yourselves with the finest oils . But you are not grieved because of the affliction of Joseph .
» Therefore you will be captured with the first that go captive . Your feasting and lounging will pass away . «
The Lord Jehovah has sworn by himself . Jehovah , the God of Hosts declares : » I abhor the pride of Jacob , and hate his palaces . Therefore I will deliver up the city with all that is in it .
» It will happen ! If there remain ten men in one house , they will die .
» When a man's uncle takes the body to be burned and brings the bones out of the house he will say to the innermost parts of the house : ‘ Is there yet any one here ? ’ ’ And he will say , ‘ No . ’ ’ Then he will say : ‘ Hold your peace . We may not make mention of the name of Jehovah . ’
» For , behold , Jehovah commanded , and the great house will be struck to pieces and the little house to tiny bits .
» Do horses run upon the rock ? Will one plow there with cattle ? You have turned justice into gall , and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood bitterness !
» You who rejoice in Lodebar , you say , ‘ have we not by our own strength taken Karnaim ? ’
» For , behold , I will raise up against you a nation , O house of Israel , « said Jehovah , the God of Hosts . » They will afflict you from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of the Arabah . «
This is what the Lord Jehovah showed me : Behold , he formed locusts in the beginning of the sprouting of the second crop . It was the later growth second crop after the king’s mowing .
It happened when they quit eating the grass of the land . I said , » O Lord Jehovah , forgive , I entreat you : how shall Jacob stand ? Since he is so small . «
Jehovah changed his mind about this . » It will not be , « said Jehovah .
The Lord Jehovah showed me and , behold , the Lord Jehovah called for judgement contention by fire and it devoured the great deep . It would have eaten up the land .
Then I said , » O Lord Jehovah , cease , I plead with you : how can Jacob stand ? After all he is small . «
Jehovah changed his mind concerning this : » This also will not be , « said the Lord Jehovah .
He showed me : and , behold , Jehovah stood beside a wall made by a plumb line , with a plumb line in his hand .
And Jehovah asked me , » Amos , what do you see ? « I said : » A plumb line . « Then Jehovah said : » Behold , I will set a plumb line in the midst of my people Israel . I will not spare them any more .
» The high places of Isaac will be desolate , and the sanctuaries of Israel will be laid waste . I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword . «
Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel , saying : » Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel . The land is not able to bear all his words . «
Amos said : » Jeroboam will die by the sword . Israel will surely be led away captive in exile out of his land . «
Amaziah said to Amos : » Go , run away , you seer . Go into the land of Judah . Eat bread and prophesy there .
» Do not prophesy any more at Bethel for it is the king's sanctuary , and it is a royal house . «
Amos told Amaziah , » I was no prophet , neither was I a prophet's son . I was a herdsman , and a grower of sycamore figs .
» Jehovah took me from following the flock , and Jehovah said to me : ‘ Go prophesy to my people Israel . ’ «
Now hear the word of Jehovah : » You say , do not prophesy against Israel , and do not speak against the house of Isaac . «
Jehovah proclaims : » Your wife will become a prostitute in the city , and your sons and daughters will fall by the sword . Your land will be divided by measuring line . You will die in a land that is unclean . Israel will surely be led away captive out of his land . «
The Lord Jehovah showed me a basket of summer fruit .
He said : » Amos , what do you see ? « And I said , » A basket of summer fruit . « Then Jehovah said to me : » The end has come to my people Israel . I will spare them no longer .
» The songs of the Temple will be weeping in that day , « said the Lord Jehovah : » the dead bodies shall be many . They will observe silence in every place .
» Hear this , you who would swallow up the needy , and cause the poor of the land to fail .
» You say : When will the new moon be gone , that we may sell grain ? And the Sabbath , that we may set forth wheat , making the ephah small , and the shekel great , and dealing falsely with balances of deceit .
» We may buy the poor for silver , and the needy for a pair of shoes , and sell the refuse of the wheat ?
» Jehovah has sworn by the pride of Jacob : I will never forget any of their works .
» Will the land not tremble for this , and every one who dwells there mourn ? I will rise up like the river . It will be troubled and sink again , like the River of Egypt .
» It will happen in that day , « said the Lord Jehovah , » that I will cause the sun to go down at noon , and I will darken the earth in the clear day .
» I will turn your feasts into mourning and all your songs into lamentation dirges . I will bring sackcloth on all loins and baldness on every head . I will make it as the mourning for an only son like the end of a bitter day .
» Behold , the day is coming , « said the Lord Jehovah , » that I will send a famine in the land . Not a famine of bread , or a thirst for water , but for hearing the words of Jehovah .
» They will wander from sea to sea and from the north even to the east . They will run to and fro to seek the word of Jehovah , and will not find it .
» In that day the fair virgins and the young men faint for thirst .
» They who swear by the sin of Samaria . They will say : ‘ As your god lives , O Dan , the way Beersheba lives . ’ ’ They will fall and never rise up again . «
I saw Jehovah standing beside the altar . He said : » Strike the capitals that the thresholds may shake ! Break them in pieces on the head of all of them and I will slay the last of them with the sword . Not one of them will get away . Not one of them will escape !
» Though they dig into the grave my hand will take them . Though they climb to heaven I will bring them down .
» Though they hide on top of Mount Carmel I will search and find them and take them from there . Though they hide from my sight on the bottom of the sea I will command the serpent to bite them .
» Though they go into the captivity of their enemies I will command the sword , and it will slay them . I will set my eyes against them for evil , and not for good .
» For the Lord , Jehovah of Hosts , is he who touches the land and it melts . All who live there will mourn . It will rise up like the River Nile , and will subside again , like the River of Egypt .
» He builds his chambers in the heavens . He founded his dome over the earth . He calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out upon the face of the earth . Jehovah is his name .
» Are you not as the children of the Ethiopians to me , O children of Israel ? « Said Jehovah . » Have I not brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt , and the Philistines from Caphtor , and the Syrians from Kir ?
» Behold , the eyes of the Lord Jehovah are upon the sinful kingdom ! Yet , I will destroy it from off the face of the earth ! I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob , « said Jehovah .
I will command , and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations ! Like grain is sifted in a sieve , yet the least kernel will not fall on the earth .
» All the sinners of my people will die by the sword . They say : The evil will not overtake nor meet us .
» In that day I will raise up the fallen tabernacle of David and close up the breaches . I will raise up its ruins and rebuild it as in the days of old .
» They may possess the remnant of Edom , and all the nations that are called by my name , « said Jehovah .
» Behold , the days are coming , « said Jehovah , » that the plowman will overtake the reaper , and the treader of grapes by the one who sows seed . The mountains will drop sweet wine , and all the hills will melt .
» I will bring my people Israel back from captivity . They will rebuild the cities and inhabit them . They will plant vineyards , and drink the wine . They will also make gardens and eat their fruit .
» I will plant them upon their own land and they will no more be plucked up out of their land that I have given them . « Jehovah your God has spoken .
The vision of Obadiah . The Sovereign Lord Jehovah spoke concerning Edom : » We have heard news from Jehovah . An ambassador is sent to the nations , saying , we must stand up against her Edom in battle . «
» Behold , I have made you small among the nations ! You are greatly despised .
» Your proud heart has deceived you . You reside in the refuge of the rock . Your habitation is high above others and you say in your heart : ‘ Who will bring me down to the ground ? ’ «
» Even though you place yourself as high as the eagle , and though you nest among the stars , I will bring you down from there , « said Jehovah !
» If thieves and robbers came to you by night you would be destroyed . Would they steel only till they had enough ? If grape-gatherers came to you , would they leave some grapes for gleaning ?
» How is Esau searched , his hidden treasures sought ?
» All the men allied with you have brought you to the border . The men that were at peace with you have deceived you and prevailed against you ! They eat your bread and lay a snare under you . There is no understanding in him Edom .
» Shall I not in that day , « said Jehovah , » destroy the wise men out of Edom , and destroy understanding out of the mountain of Esau ?
» Your mighty men , O Teman , will be dismayed , to the end that every one may be destroyed removed from the mountain of Esau by slaughter .
» You will be covered with shame for the violence done to your brother Jacob . You will be destroyed and disgraced for a very long time .
» In that day you stood on the other side ! In that day strangers carried away his wealth . Foreigners entered his gates , and cast lots for Jerusalem ! It was as if you were one of them !
Do not look on the day of your brother’s disaster . Do not rejoice over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction ! Do not speak proudly in the day of distress .
» Do not enter the gate of my people in the day of their calamity ! Do not look on their affliction in the day of their tragedy ! Do not loot their wealth in the day of their disaster .
» Do not stand in the way of those who escape and do not hand over his survivors in the day of distress .
» The Day of Jehovah draws near upon all the nations . It will be done to you just as you have done . Your dealings will return upon you head !
» Just as you have drunk upon my holy mountain , so will all the nations drink ! Continually : Yes they will drink , and swallow down , and will be as though they had never existed .
» There will be those who escape in Mount Zion . It will be holy , and the house of Jacob will take confiscate their possessions .
» The house of Jacob will be a fire ! The house of Joseph will be a flame ! The house of Esau will be for stubble and they will burn among them , and devour them . There will be no survivors of the house of Esau : for Jehovah has spoken !
» And they of the South will possess the mount of Esau ! They of the lowland , the Philistines , will possess the field of Ephraim and the field of Samaria ! Benjamin will possess Gilead .
» The captives of this host of the children of Israel among the Canaanites , will possess Zarephath . The captives of Jerusalem in Sepharad will possess the cities of the South .
» Saviors will come up on Mount Zion to judge the mountain of Esau ; and the kingdom will be Jehovah's . «
Now the word of Jehovah came to Jonah the son of Amittai . He said :
» Arise , go to Nineveh the great city and proclaim against her that Jehovah has seen their terrible wickedness . «
Jonah tried to run away from the presence of Jehovah . He went to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish . He paid the fare and boarded it to go with them to Tarshish away from the presence of Jehovah .
Jehovah sent out a great windstorm upon the sea and the ship was about to break up .
The sailors were so afraid that each man cried out to his own god . They threw the cargo that was on the ship into the sea to lighten the load . At that time Jonah was fast asleep down in the innermost parts of the ship .
So the captain came to him , and said : » Why are you sleeping ? Get up and call on your god . Perhaps your god will be concerned about us so that we will not perish . «
The sailors said to each other , » Come , and let us cast lots , that we may know whom to blame for this evil . « So they cast lots , and the lot fell upon Jonah .
Then they said to him , » Please tell us who is the cause of this evil ? What is your occupation ? Where do you come from ? What is your country ? What people are they ? «
He replied : » I am Hebrew and I respect Jehovah , the God of heaven , who has made the sea and the dry land . «
Then the men were very afraid , and they asked : » What is this you have done ? « For the men knew that he was running away from the presence of Jehovah , because he told them .
Then they said : » What shall we do to you to make the sea calm for us ? « But the sea grew more and more stormy .
He replied : » Pick me up and throw me into the sea . Then the sea will be calm for you . I know that it is my fault the great storm came upon you . «
The men rowed hard to get back to the land ; but they could not ! The sea grew more and more stormy against them .
So they cried to Jehovah , and said : » We earnestly request that you , O Jehovah , do not let us perish because of this man . Do not allow the loss of innocent blood ! For you , O Jehovah , have done as you pleased . «
So they picked up Jonah , and threw him into the sea . Immediately the sea ceased from its raging .
The men greatly reverenced Jehovah . They offered a sacrifice to Jehovah , and made vows .
However , Jehovah prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah . Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights .
Then Jonah prayed to Jehovah his God from inside the fish's belly .
He said : » I called to Jehovah because of my affliction . And he answered me ! Out of the belly of the grave I cried and you heard my voice .
» For you threw me into the deep , in the heart of the seas . The current was all around me . All your waves , your huge breakers passed over me !
» And I said : I have been cast out of your sight . Yet I will look again toward your Holy Temple .
» The waters encompassed me and threatened my life . The deep sea surrounded me . The sea weeds were wrapped about my head .
» I went down to the bottom of the mountains ! The earth with its bars closed upon me for a very long time . Yet you have brought my life up from the pit , O Jehovah my God ?
» My life was leaving me and I remembered Jehovah ! My prayer came to you , into your Holy Temple .
» They that regard lying vanities forsake their own mercy .
» But I will sacrifice to you with the voice of thanksgiving ! I will pay that which I have vowed . Salvation is from Jehovah ! «
Jehovah spoke to the fish , and it vomited Jonah out upon the dry land .
The word of Jehovah came to Jonah a second time :
» Arise and go to the great city , Nineveh . Proclaim to it the proclamation I give you . «
So Jonah arose , and went to Nineveh , according to the word of Jehovah . Nineveh was a very important and large city , a three days' walk from one side to the other .
Jonah began to enter into the city , a day's journey walking , and he shouted : » Nineveh will be overthrown in Forty days . «
The people of Nineveh believed God and they proclaimed a fast , and put on sackcloth , from the greatest of them even to the least of them .
The news reached the king of Nineveh . He left his throne , and took off his robe and covered himself with sackcloth . Then he sat in ashes .
He made proclamation and published it in Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles , saying : » Let neither man nor beast , herd nor flock , taste anything ; let them not eat , nor drink water .
» Let them be covered with sackcloth , both man and beast . Let them sincerely call on God ! Let them turn away each one from his evil way , and from the violence that is in his hands .
» Who knows whether God will turn back and change his mind , and turn away from his fierce anger that we will not perish ? «
God saw their works ! That they turned from their evil way . God turned back from the deed that he said he would do to them . He did not do it .
But it displeased Jonah exceedingly . He was angry !
He prayed to Jehovah : » I pray to you , O Jehovah , was this what I said , when I was yet in my country ? Therefore I hurried to flee to Tarshish . Because I knew that you are a gracious God . You are merciful , slow to anger , abundant in loving kindness , and one who takes pity over calamity tragedy catastrophe disaster .
» Now , O Jehovah , please take my life from me for it is better for me to die than to live . «
Jehovah asked him : » Do you have good reason to be angry ? «
Then Jonah went out of the city . He sat on the east side of the city . He made a booth , and sat under it in the shade . He wanted to see what would become of the city .
And Jehovah God prepared a gourd plant . He made it grow up over Jonah . That way it would be a shade over his head . It would deliver him from his disastrous fateful attitude . So Jonah was very glad to have the gourd plant .
The next morning God prepared a worm and it attacked the plant and it withered .
When the sun rose God prepared a sultry burning hot east wind . So the sun beat upon the head of Jonah and he grew faint . He requested for himself that he might die . He said : » It is better for me to die than to live ! «
However God replied to Jonah : » Do you have good reason to be angry at the plant ? « He said to God : » I have good reason to be angry even unto death . «
Jehovah said : » You have compassion for the plant for which you did not work and which you did not cause to grow . It came up overnight and perished in a night .
» Should I not then have regard for Nineveh , that great city , where there are more than one hundred and twenty thousand people that do not know the difference between their right and their left hand , and also many animals ? «
The word of Jehovah that came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah . This is the vision he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem :
» Hear , all you peoples ! Listen , O earth , and all who are in it ! Let the Sovereign Lord Jehovah be a witness against you , Jehovah from his Holy Temple .
» For , behold , Jehovah comes out of his place ! He comes down and treads upon the high places of the earth .
» The mountains melt under him . The valleys split like wax before the fire ! Like waters poured down a steep place .
» This is because of the transgression of Jacob and the sins of the house of Israel . What is the transgression of Jacob ? Is it not the idol worship of Samaria ? What is Judah’s high place ? Is it not Jerusalem ?
» I will make Samaria a heap of ruins in the field . It will be a place for planting vineyards . I will tumble down her stones into the valley ! I will uncover her foundations .
» All her images will be broken to pieces ! All that she has earned will be burned with fire . I will destroy all her idols . She gathered them for the price of a prostitute and for the price of a prostitute they will return . «
I Micah will lament and wail . I will go barefoot and naked . I will make a howling like the jackals , and a lamentation like the ostriches .
Samaria’s wound is incurable ! It came as far as Judah . It even reached to the gate of my people , Jerusalem .
» Do not announce it at Gath , Philistia . Do not weep or show grief . At the house of Ophrah house of dust roll in the dust !
» Pass away , O inhabitant of Shaphir , in nakedness and shame . The inhabitant of Zaanan has not come forth ! The wailing of Bethezel takes away from you the place where it stands .
» The inhabitant of Maroth waits anxiously for good , because bad came down from Jehovah to the gate of Jerusalem .
» Bind the chariot to the swift steed , O lady inhabitant of Lachish ! You were the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion . The transgressions of Israel were found in you .
» Therefore you should give a parting gift to Micah’s hometown Moresheth-gath . The houses of Achzib shall be a place of deceit to the kings of Israel .
» I will yet bring a conqueror against you , O inhabitant of Mareshah ! He will possess you . The glory of Israel will come to Adullam .
» Make yourself bald . Cut off your hair for the children of your delight ! Enlarge your baldness as the eagle . For your children are gone into exile captivity from you . «
» Woe to those who devise iniquity and work evil upon their beds ! When the morning comes they do it because they are able to it is in the power of their hands .
» They covet fields and seize them . They covet houses and confiscate them ! They oppress a man and his house , even a man and his heritage . «
Therefore Jehovah says : » Behold , against this family I plan bad things , from which you will not remove the burden . You will not be able to show pride for it is an evil time .
» In that day they will taunt you and speak mournfully with sorrow and much grief : ‘ We are utterly ruined ! He exchanged the portion of my people and removed it from me . He divided our fields and gave them to the apostate . « ’
» You will not have any who cast the measuring line by lot in the assembly of Jehovah .
» Do not prophesy to me . They prophesy . But they will not prophesy these things .
» Will it be said , O house of Jacob , ‘ Is the Spirit of Jehovah impatient ? Are these his doings ? Do my words not do good for he who walks uprightly ? ’
» Lately my people have become an enemy ! You strip the robe off the garment from passersby , from men returning from war .
» You evict the women of my people from their pleasant houses . You remove the glory of their young children from generation to generation .
» Get up and go because this is not your resting-place . Uncleanness brings on destruction , a painful destruction .
» If a man who is a constant liar tells a lie saying : ‘ I will prophesy to you about wine and of strong drink ; ’ ’ he would be the prophet of this people .
» I will surely assemble , O Jacob , all of you . I will surely gather the remnant of Israel ! I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah , as a flock in the midst of their pasture . They will make great noise because of the crowd of men .
» The breaker one who opens the breach one that breaks through has gone ahead of them . They will pass through the gate and go out by it . Their king will lead them with Jehovah at the head of them . «
I said : » Please listen , you heads of Jacob , and rulers of the house of Israel : is it not your responsibility to know justice ?
» You hate good and love evil ! You rip off their skin and their flesh from off their bones !
» You eat the flesh of my people , and flay their skin from off them ! You break their bones , and chop them in pieces similar to the contents of a pot or a caldron .
» They will cry to Jehovah but he will not answer them . In fact , he will hide his face from them at that time because they have done evil things . «
Jehovah spoke concerning the prophets : » They make my people stray . They bite with their teeth and cry , » Peace , « but receive nothing in their mouths . They declare holy war on him .
» Therefore you will have night . You will have no vision ! It will be dark to you . You will not perform divination . The sun will go down on the prophets and they will be in the dark .
» The visionaries will be shamed . The diviners confounded ! They will all cover their mouths for there is no answer from God . «
Jehovah’s Spirit fills me with power ! I have judgment and mightiness to declare to Jacob , his evil behavior , to tell Israel about his sin !
Please hear this you heads of the house of Jacob , and rulers of the house of Israel . You who abhor justice , and pervert honesty !
They build up Zion with blood , and Jerusalem with immorality .
The leaders judge for a bribe , and the priests teach for wages ! The prophets predict for money yet they rely on Jehovah when they say : » Is not Jehovah in the midst of us ? No evil will come upon us . «
It is your fault that Zion will be plowed like a field . Jerusalem will become heaps of ruin , and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest .
It will happen in the last days ! The mountain of the house of Jehovah will be established above the top of the mountains . It will be exalted above the hills . Peoples will flow to it .
Many nations will come . They will say : » Come you people , let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah , to the house of the God of Jacob . He will teach us his ways , and we will walk in his paths ! « For out of Zion will go forth the law , and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem .
He will judge between many peoples , and will decide concerning strong nations far away . They will beat their swords into plowshares , and their spears into pruning hooks ! Nation will not lift up sword against nation and they will not learn war any more !
Each man will sit under his vine and under his fig tree . No one will make them afraid ! The mouth of Jehovah of Hosts has spoken .
All the nations walk every one in the name of their god . We will walk in the name of Jehovah our God forever and ever .
» In that day , « said Jehovah , » I will assemble the lame , and I will gather the outcasts , and those I have afflicted .
» I will make the lame a remnant and the outcast far off a strong nation . Jehovah will reign over them in mount Zion from now on and forever .
» You , O tower of the flock , the hill of the daughter of Zion , it will come to you . The former dominion will come , the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem .
» Why do you cry out aloud ? Is there no king in you ? Has your counselor perished ? Has pain taken hold of you like a woman in childbirth ?
» Be in pain , and labor to bring forth , O daughter of Zion , like a woman in childbirth ! For now you will go out of the city and dwell in the field . You will go to Babylon where you will be rescued . Jehovah will redeem you from the hand of your enemies .
» Many nations are assembled against you ! They say : ‘ Let her be defiled , and let us gloat over it . ’
» They do not know Jehovah’s thoughts . Neither do they understand his counsel . He has gathered them like the sheaves of cut grain to the threshing floor .
» Arise and thresh , O daughter of Zion ! I will make your horn like iron and I will make your hoofs like brass . You will pulverize many nations into pieces . I will devote their profit and wealth to Jehovah the Lord of the whole earth . «
» Now you will gather in troops , O daughter of troops ! He has attacked us . They will strike the judge of Israel on the cheek with a rod .
» You Bethlehem Ephrathah who are little to be among the thousands of Judah . Out of you one will come to me who is to be ruler in Israel ! His origin is from of old , from everlasting days of antiquity ancient times .
» He will give them up , until the time that she who is giving birth delivers . Then the remainder of his brothers will return to the children of Israel .
» He will stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of Jehovah . They will abide in the majesty of the name of Jehovah his God ! Now he will be great to the ends of the earth .
» This man will be our peace . When the Assyrian invades our land and tramples our palaces we will raise against him seven shepherds , and eight leaders of men .
» They will rule the land of Assyria and the entrances to the land of Nimrod with the sword . When he comes to our land and treads inside our borders he will deliver us from the Assyrian .
» Like dew from Jehovah the remnant of Jacob will be in the midst of many peoples . It will be like showers upon the grass that do not wait for man or for sons of men .
» The remnant of Jacob will be among the nations , in the midst of many peoples . It will be like a lion among the beasts of the forest . Should he go through he will be like a young lion among the flocks of sheep . He treads down and tears to pieces . There is none to rescue .
» Let your hand power be lifted up exalted above your adversaries , and let all your enemies be destroyed . «
» It will happen , « said Jehovah : » I will remove and destroy your horses and your chariots from among you .
» I will destroy the cities of your land , and I will throw down all your strongholds .
» I will remove witchcrafts from your hand . You will have no more magic practitioners .
» I will remove your graven images and your sacred pillars from you . You will no longer worship the work of your hands .
» I will remove your godess Astarte from your midst . I will destroy your cities .
» In anger and rage I will execute vengeance on the nations that have not obeyed me . «
Listen to what Jehovah said : Arise , plead your case before the mountains . Let the hills hear your voice .
Hear Jehovah’s indictment you mountains and you enduring foundations of the earth ! Jehovah argues a case against his people . He will contend with Israel :
» O my people , what have I done to you ? How have I grieved you ? Respond to me .
» I brought you out of the land of Egypt . I redeemed you out of the house of bondage . I sent before you Moses , Aaron , and Miriam .
» O my people , remember now what Balak king of Moab devised , and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him . Remember from Shittim to Gilgal , that you may know the righteous acts of Jehovah . «
With what shall I come before Jehovah ? Shall I bow down before the high God ? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings , with year old calves ?
Will Jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams , or with ten thousand rivers of oil ? Shall I give my first-born for my transgression , the fruit of my body for my sin ?
He told you , O lowly man , what is good and what Jehovah requires of you . You should display justice , love kindness , and walk humbly with your God !
The voice of Jehovah calls to the city . The man of wisdom will see respect your name ! Hear the rod and who appointed it .
Is there a depository of wickedness in the house of the wicked , and a short measure that is cursed ?
Can I be pure with wicked scales and with a bag of deceitful stone weights ?
The rich men are full of violence ! Her inhabitants speak lies . Their tongue is deceitful in their mouth .
» I also struck you with a grievous wound . I made you desolate because of your sins .
» You will eat and not be satisfied . Your stomach will still be empty . You will put away and yet will not save . That which you save I will give to the sword .
» You will sow and not reap . You will tread the olives , but will not be anointed with oil ! And you will grow the grapes but you will not drink the wine .
» The statutes of Omri and the works of the house of Ahab are observed . You walk in their counsels . I will make you desolation ! The inhabitants will be hissed . You will bear the reproach of my people . «
Too bad for me ! For I am like the gathered summer fruit , as the grape gleanings of the vintage . There is no cluster to eat . I desire the first ripe fig .
The godly loyal holy man has perished from the earth . There is none upright among men ! They all lie in wait for blood . Every man hunts his own brother with a net .
They diligently seek to do evil with their hands . The prince asks and the judge is ready for a bribe . The great man utters his own evil desire . They weave it together .
The best of them is as a brier . The most upright is worse than a thorn hedge ! Your watchmen’s day has come . Your visitation has come . Now you will be perplexed .
Do not put your faith in your neighbor . Do not trust a friend ! Guard your lips from her who lies in your bosom is your intimate companion .
The son dishonors the father . The daughter rises up against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law . A man's enemies are the men of his own house .
But as for me , I will look to Jehovah ! I will wait for the God of my salvation ! My God will hear me .
Do not rejoice against me , O my enemy ! When I fall , I will arise . When I sit in darkness , Jehovah will be a light to me .
I will bear the indignation of Jehovah , because I have sinned against him . He will plead my cause , and execute judgment for me . He will bring me forth to the light and I will see his righteousness .
My enemy will see it and she will be filled with shame . She will ask : » Where is Jehovah your God ? « My eyes will look upon her and she will be trampled down like the mire of the streets .
A day for building your walls ! In that day the decree will be far removed .
Then they will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt . They will come from Egypt even to the River , and from sea to sea , and from mountain to mountain .
The earth will become desolate because of the inhabitants and the fruit of their deeds .
Shepherd your people , the flock of your heritage , with your staff . They dwell alone in the forest in the midst of Carmel . Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead , as in the days of old .
» I will show them marvelous things like the days of your coming out of the land of Egypt .
» The nations will see and be ashamed of all their might ! They will cover their mouth with their hand and their ears will be deaf .
» They will lick up the dust like a serpent . They will come trembling out of their hole like crawling things of the earth . They will approach Jehovah our God with fear and be afraid because of you . «
Who is a God like you who pardons iniquity and passes over the transgression of the remnant of his heritage ? You do not keep your anger forever , because you delight in loving-kindness unchanging love .
You will again have compassion on us . You will tread our iniquities under foot . You will throw all our sins into the depths of the sea .
You will give truth to Jacob , and show loving-kindness unchanging love to Abraham . For you have sworn this to our fathers from the days of old .
The oracle of Nineveh . The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite :
Jehovah is a zealous God requiring exclusive devotion tolerates no rivals . Jehovah takes vengeance punishment against his adversaries . He reserves maintains wrath indignation displeasure against his enemies .
Jehovah is slow to anger , and great in power ! He will by no means reprieve the guilty leave them unpunished . Jehovah has his way in the whirlwind and in the storm . The clouds are the dust of his feet .
He rebukes the sea , and makes it dry . He dries up all the rivers . Bashan and Carmel become dry and the flower of Lebanon withers .
The mountains quake because of him , and the hills melt . The earth trembles shakes heaves at his presence , yes , the world , and all that dwells in it .
Who can stand before his indignation displeasure ? Who can resist withstand endure the heat of his anger ? His wrath is poured out like fire , and the rocks are broken to pieces by him .
Jehovah is good , a stronghold in the day of trouble ! He knows protects takes care of those who take refuge in him .
He will exterminate adversaries with an over flowing flood and will pursue his enemies into darkness .
What do you fabricate impute against Jehovah ? He will exterminate it ! Affliction will not rise up a second time .
Entangled like thorns and drunken from drink , they are consumed like dry stubble .
There is one who comes out from you O Nineveh . He counsels wickedness and devises evil against Jehovah .
Jehovah declares : » Though they are strong and are many they will be destroyed ! They will pass away . Though I have afflicted you O Judah I will not afflict you any more .
» I will break their yoke off of you . I will remove your restraint .
» Jehovah has given command concerning you Nineveh . Your name will no longer be perpetuated . I will throw your gods , graven and molten images out of your house . I despise you ! You are contemptible ! I will prepare your grave .
» Behold , upon the mountains the feet of him who brings good tidings . Who publishes peace ! Keep your feasts , O Judah and perform your vows ! The wicked will no more pass through invade you . They will be completely destroyed . «
He who breaks in pieces has come up against you : Safeguard the fortress , watch the way , make your loins strong , and reinforce your power .
Jehovah will restore the pride of Jacob just like the pride of Israel . The devastators have emptied them out and destroyed their vine-branches .
The shield of his mighty men is made red , the valiant men are dressed in scarlet : the chariots flash with steel in the day of his preparation , and the cypress tree spears are brandished .
The chariots wildly race through the streets . They rush to and fro in the broad ways . They look like torches and they run like lightning .
He remembers his majestic ones . They stumble as they march . They hurry to the wall to prepare the barricade .
The gates of the rivers are opened and the palace is dissolved .
It is decreed : she is uncovered ! She is carried away and her handmaids moan like the sound of doves , beating on their chests .
Nineveh has been from of old like a pool of water : yet they flee away . » Stand , stand , « they cry ; but none looks back .
Take the spoil of silver , take the spoil of gold for there is no limit to the amount of desirable things .
She is empty and void , a city laid waste ! The hearts melt and the knees knock together . There is pain in all the hips and their faces have all grown pale .
Where is the lions den , the feeding-place of young lions ? Where have the lion and the lioness walked where none have made them afraid ?
The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps , and strangled for his lionesses . He filled his caves and dens with prey .
» I am against you , « said Jehovah of Hosts ! » I will burn her chariots in the smoke , and the sword will devour your young lions . I will destroy your prey from the earth , and the voice of your messengers will be heard no more . «
Woe to the bloody city ! It is full of lies and robbery ! The prey does not leave .
There is the noise of the whip and the sound of the rattling wheel ; the sound of the dashing horse and the bounding chariot .
The horseman is mounting . There is the flashing sword and the glittering spear ! The multitudes of slain ones produce a great heap of corpses . There is no end of the bodies ! They stumble upon their bodies .
This is because of Nineveh's constant prostitution , this very charming mistress of evil magic . She used to sell nations by her prostitution and people by her evil magic .
» I am against you , Nineveh , « declares Jehovah of Hosts . » I will lift up your dress over your face . I will show nations your naked body and kingdoms your disgrace .
I will treat you with contempt and cover you with filth . People will stare at you in horror .
» And it will come about that all who see you will go in flight from you and say , Nineveh is devastated : who will weep for her ? Where will I get comforters for her ?
» Are you better than Noamon , which sits by the streams of the Nile with water surrounding her ? The sea was her defense . The water was her wall .
» Sudan and Egypt were her endless strength . Put and the Lybians were her help .
» She went into captivity and was exiled . Her children were smashed to death at every street corner . Soldiers tossed dice for her important men , and all her best men were bound in chains .
» Nineveh , you will stagger like a drunk . You will disappear . You will look for a fortress to escape from the enemy .
» All your defenses will be like fig trees with the ripe figs . When shaken , the figs fall into the mouth of the eater .
» Look ! Your soldiers are like women ! The gates of your land are wide open to your enemies . Fire will destroy the bars of your gates .
» Draw pump water for the siege ! Strengthen your defenses ! Step into the clay pits and trample the clay ! Grab hold of the brick mold !
» You will be burned to death or killed in battle . You will be devoured like crops eaten by locusts . You grew in number like locusts !
» You multiplied your merchants like the stars in the sky ! But now they are gone , like locusts that spread their wings and fly away .
» Your princes are as the locusts , and your officers as the swarms of grasshoppers . They encamp in the hedges on a cold day , but when the sun shines they flee away and no one knows where they go .
» Your shepherds slumber , O king of Assyria ; your nobles are at rest . Your people are scattered upon the mountains , and there is none to gather them .
» There is no relief for your pain . Your wound is grievous ! All who hear the report about you applaud for your wickedness affected everyone . «
This is the message Jehovah revealed to Habakkuk the prophet :
How long , O Jehovah , will I call for help and you do not hear ? I cry out to you , save me from violence ! And yet you do not save .
Why do you make me see wickedness and immorality ? Destruction and violence are before me . Strife exists and contention arises .
The law is paralyzed and justice is never delivered . The wicked surround the righteous and deliver perverted justice .
» Look among the nations , watch , and be amazed . Though you are told you will not believe the work I do today .
» Behold , I bring the Chaldeans to power , that bitter and impetuous nation . They march through the expanse of the earth to possess dwelling places that are not theirs .
» They are feared and dreaded . Their justice and dignity are of their own being .
» Their horses are swifter than leopards . They are fiercer than the evening wolves . Their horsemen proudly press on . Yes , their horsemen come from afar . They fly like an eagle in a hurry to eat .
» They all come for violence . Their crowds look straight ahead and gather prisoners like the sand .
» They scoff at kings , and princes are derision to them . They laugh at every stronghold , for they build earthen ramps and capture them .
» They will sweep by like a wind and continue on . They will be held guilty for might is their god . «
You are from everlasting , O Jehovah my God , my Holy One , You are eternal . O Jehovah , you have appointed them the Chaldean to execute judgment . You , O Rock , have established them for correction .
Your eyes are too pure to look at evil . You cannot look at perversity . Why do you look at treacherous persons and not act ? Why do you keep quiet when the wicked destroy the man who is more righteous ?
Why do you make men like the fish of the sea , like creeping things that have no ruler over them ?
He brings them all up with the hook . He gathers them away in his net . He gladly gathers them and rejoices .
He offers sacrifices and burns incense to his fishing net . For it is through this their catch is great and the food is plentiful .
Will they keep on emptying their nets and keep on destroying nations without mercy ?
I will stand at my guard post at the tower on the wall . I will watch and wait to see what he will say to me and what I will answer when I am reproved .
Jehovah answered me : » Write the vision . Record it on tablets that he who reads it may run .
» The vision is yet for the appointed time . It moves quickly to the end . It will not lie ! If it delays , wait for it for it will surely come . It will not be late !
» Behold , he is proud . He is not righteous . The righteous will live by faith .
» Wine is treacherous and never allows an arrogant man to rest . He never stays home . He has a large appetite like the grave . Like death he is never satisfied . He gathers all nations and collects all the people .
» Will they all taunt him by directing clever sayings and riddles at him ? They will say : How horrible it will be for the one who makes himself rich with what is not his own by extortion and makes himself wealthy on loans . How long will this go on ?
» Will your creditors and collection agents suddenly arise and make you tremble ? Then you will become their prize .
» The people who remain will plunder you because you have plundered many nations . It is because of the blood you shed and the violence you brought on the land , the city and all who dwell there .
» He who receives a dishonest profit for his house will have trouble . He may set his nest on high in order to be delivered from the hand of evil !
» You have purposed a shameful thing for your house . You have sinned against yourself by destroying many people .
» The stones will cry out from the wall . The beams out of the woodwork will answer it .
» Woe to him who builds a town with bloodshed and establishes a city with iniquity !
» Is it for Jehovah of Hosts that the peoples labor for the fire ? Do the nations weary themselves for vanity ?
» The earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah , as the waters cover the sea .
» Woe to anyone who gives his neighbors drink and empties his bottle . He makes them drunk and then looks on their nakedness .
» You are filled with shame and not glory . You drink also as one who is uncircumcised . The cup of Jehovah's right strong hand will come around to you . Intense shame will tarnish your glory .
» The violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you . The destruction of the animals and shedding of blood will frighten you . The violence done to the inhabitants of the land and the city will terrify you .
» What is an idol worth after the carver is done ? It is merely a false god . Why trust a speechless image made by human hands from wood or metal ?
» Woe to anyone who says to an idol of wood or stone get up ! You can learn nothing from idols covered with silver or gold ? They cannot breathe or talk .
» Jehovah is in his Holy Temple . Let all the earth be silent before him . «
A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet , set to a rambling poem :
O Jehovah , I heard the report about you and I am afraid of your actions . O Jehovah , make it live in the midst of the years . In the midst of the years make it known ! When you are angry remember mercy .
God came from Teman . He is the Holy One from Mount Paran . His glory covered the heavens ! The earth is full of his praise .
His brightness is like the sun . He has rays of power coming from his hand ! There was protection in his power .
Before him go the pestilence , and fiery bolts go forth at his feet .
He stood and measured the earth . He looked and agitated the nations . The everlasting mountains were shattered ! The ancient hills collapsed . His ways are eternal !
I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction . The tent cloths of the land of Midian trembled .
Was Jehovah displeased with the rivers ? Was your anger against the rivers ? Or is your fury against the sea ? You rode upon the horses and your chariots are salvation .
Your bow was made quite bare . The oaths to the tribes were a sure word . You split the earth with your rivers .
The mountains saw you and were afraid . The tempest of waters passed by . The deep water uttered its voice , and lifted up its hands power on high .
The sun and moon stood still in their habitation . They went away at the light of your arrows and the shining of your glittering spear .
You marched through the land in indignation . You trampled the nations in anger .
You went forth for the salvation of your people even for the salvation of your anointed . You wounded the head of the wicked man in the house of the evil . You laid bare the foundation even to the neck .
You pierced the head of his warriors . They came as a whirlwind to scatter me . They secretly devour the oppressed .
You tread the sea with your horses , the serge of mighty waters .
I heard and my body trembled ! My lips quivered at the voice . Rottenness entered into my bones and I tremble . I must wait quietly for the day of trouble , for the people who invade us .
The fig tree will not flourish . There will be no fruit on the vines . The labor of the olive will fail and the fields will yield no food ! The flock will be cut off from the fold and there will be no herd in the stalls .
Yet I will rejoice in Jehovah ! I will find joy in the God of my salvation .
Jehovah , the Sovereign Lord , is my strength ! He makes my feet like a deer’s feet . He will make me walk upon high places .
This is the word Jehovah spoke to Zephaniah . Zephaniah was the son of Cushi , the grandson of Gedaliah , and the great-grandson of Amariah , son of Hezekiah . Jehovah spoke his word in the days of Judah's King Josiah , son of Amon .
» I will destroy take away remove consume everything on the face of the earth ! « declared Jehovah .
» I will terminate both man and beast . I will put an end to the birds of the sky and the fish of the sea . I will eliminate the sins that make people fall , together with the sinners . I will remove people from the face of the earth , « declared Jehovah .
» I will use my power against Judah and against the inhabitants of Jerusalem . I will destroy followers of Baal in this place . I will remove the names of the pagan idolatrous priests along with my priests .
» I will remove those who bow down to worship the host of heaven on the housetops and those who bow down and swear to Jehovah and yet swear by Malcolm .
» The same for those who have turned back from following Jehovah , and those who have not sought Jehovah or inquired of Him . «
Be silent before the Sovereign Lord Jehovah ! For the day of Jehovah is near ! Jehovah has prepared a sacrifice . He has sanctified His guests .
» On that day of Jehovah’s sacrifice , « said Jehovah , » I will punish the officials , the king's sons , and all who practice foreign customs .
» I will punish all who worship false gods and who steal and kill in order to fill their master's house with violence . «
» On that day , « said Jehovah , » you will hear the sound of crying at the Fish Gate in Jerusalem . You will hear wailing in the newer part of the city and a loud crash from the hills .
» Wail , you inhabitants of Maktesh ! The people of Canaan have perished . Those wealthy with silver will be destroyed .
» At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps . I will punish the men that are satisfied with their wayward lifestyle . They say in their heart , ‘ Jehovah will not do good and he will not do evil . ’
» Their wealth will be looted . Their homes will be demolished . They will build houses . However they will not live in them ! They will plant vineyards . But they will not drink their wine !
» The great Day of Jehovah is near . It is near and coming quickly . Listen ! The mighty man will cry out bitterly on the Day of Jehovah .
» That day will be a day of wrath , a day of distress and anguish . That day will be a day of trouble , devastation and desolation ! It will be a day of darkness and gloom . Indeed that day will be a day of clouds and overcast skies .
» That day will be a day of alarm signals and battle cries against the fortified cities and against the high corner towers .
» I will bring distress on humans and they will walk like they are blind ! They have sinned against Jehovah ! Their blood will be poured out like dust and their intestines like manure .
» Their silver and their gold will not be able to keep them safe in the Day of Jehovah’s anger rage wrath . He will devour all the nations by the fire of his zeal ! He will exterminate all the inhabitants of the earth ! «
Come together , make everyone come together , you nation without shame !
Before the decree takes effect . Before the day passes like the chaff . Before the fierce anger of Jehovah comes upon you . Yes , before the Day of Jehovah's anger comes upon you .
Seek Jehovah all you meek ones of the earth , you who have obeyed his Law ! Seek righteousness ! Seek meekness that you may be hidden in the Day of Jehovah's anger . Hebrew : ulay-ulay , may-be ; Septuagint : » you may be hid . « Hebrew : sathar : concealed , hidden , protected
For Gaza will be abandoned . Ashkelon will be a desolate waste . They will drive out Ashdod at high noon . Ekron will be exterminated .
» Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast , the nation of the Cherethites ! The word of Jehovah is against you , O Canaan , the land of the Philistines . I will destroy you and you will not be inhabited .
» The seacoast will be pastures , with cottages for shepherds and pens for sheep .
» The coast will be for the remnant of the house of Judah . They will feed their flocks there . They will rest at night in the houses of Ashkelon . Jehovah their God will visit them and gather back the captive ones . «
» I have heard the reproach of Moab and the taunting by the children of Ammon . They have reproached my people . They behave arrogantly at the border . «
» Just as I live , « said Jehovah of Hosts , the God of Israel , » Moab will be like Sodom , and the children of Ammon like Gomorrah . They will be possessions of nettles and salt pits . They will be deserted forever ! My people will plunder them and the remnant of my nation will take possession of their land .
» They will have this instead of their pride . This is because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of Jehovah of Hosts .
» Jehovah will fill them with fear for he will starve emaciate all the gods of the earth ! Men will worship him , each one from his place , even the coastlands of the nations .
» You Ethiopians Cushites will be slain by my sword !
» He will stretch out his hand exercise his power against the north , and destroy Assyria . He will make Nineveh a desolation . It will be barren like the desert wilderness .
» And herds will lie down in her midst , all the beasts of the nations . The pelican and the porcupine will lodge on the top of her pillars . Their voice will sing hoot croak in the windows . Desolation will be in the thresholds for he will lay bare that which is built with cedar .
» This is the joyous city that dwelled in security . She said in her heart , ‘ I am ! There is no one else ! ’ ’ She has become an object of desolation , a place for wild animals to lie down in . Every one who passes by her will hiss , and wag his hand . «
Woe to the oppressive city for she is rebellious and polluted defiled !
She did not obey the voice of Jehovah . She would not accept correction discipline . She did not trust Jehovah and draw close to her God .
Her princes rulers within her are roaring lions . Her judges are evening wolves . They leave nothing till the morning .
Her prophets are insolent and treacherous persons . Her priests have profaned the sanctuary ! They have done violence to the law .
Jehovah is righteous within her . He will do no wrong . He brings justice to the dawn of the morning . He does not fail ! Yet the unjust know no shame .
» I have destroyed nations ! Their battlements are completely destroyed ! I have made their streets waste so that none pass by . I destroyed the people and the cities so that there is no inhabitant .
» I said , show me respect and receive discipline instruction correction ! That way she would not loose her dwelling . This is according to all that I have appointed concerning her . But they rose early to corrupt all their deeds . «
» Wait for me , « said Jehovah , » until the day that I rise up as a witness . I am determined to gather the nations . I will assemble the kingdoms to pour out upon them my indignation , even all my fierce anger ! All the earth will be devoured with the fire of my zeal .
» I will give the peoples a pure language . They may all call upon the name of Jehovah , to serve him united in total agreement and purpose shoulder to shoulder .
» The daughter of my scattered ones my people my worshippers will bring an offering to me from beyond the rivers of Ethiopia .
» At that time you will no longer be ashamed of your transgression against me . I will remove everyone who is proud and arrogant . You will never again be haughty on my holy mountain .
» I will leave a faithful few , a humble and lowly people with you . They will seek refuge in the name of Jehovah .
» The faithful few remnant in Israel will not do wrong , tell lies , or use their tongues to deceive others . They will feed their sheep and lie down , and there will be no one making trouble for them . «
Shout for joy , O daughter of Zion ! Shout and sing in triumph , O Israel ! Rejoice and exult with all your heart , O daughter of Jerusalem !
Jehovah has removed his judgments against you . He has turned aside your enemies . The King of Israel , Jehovah , is in your midst ! You will fear calamity no more .
Jerusalem will be told in that day : » Do not be afraid , O Zion ! Do not loose courage .
» Jehovah your God is with you ! He is a mighty one . He will exult over you with joy . He will refresh you with his love . He will rejoice over you with shouts of joy .
» I will gather those who grieve about the appointed feasts . They came from Jerusalem . The reproach of exile is a burden to them .
» I will deal at that time with all your oppressors . I will save the lame and gather the outcast . I will turn their shame into praise and renown in all the earth .
» At that time I will bring you in ! At that time I will gather you together . I will give you a name honor and praise among all the peoples of the earth ! This will happen when I gather back your captive ones before your very eyes , « declares Jehovah .
It was the second year that Darius was king of Persia . Jehovah spoke through Haggai the prophet in the sixth month , on the first day of the month . The message was delivered to the governor of Judah , Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and to the High Priest , Joshua son of Jehozadak .
Jehovah of Hosts said to Haggai : » These people say that this is not the right time to rebuild the Temple . «
Then came the word of Jehovah by Haggai the prophet . He said :
» Is it time for you to dwell in your roofed and covered houses , while this house is desolate ? «
Jehovah of Hosts said : » Consider your ways .
» You sow much and reap little . You eat but you do not have enough ! You drink and yet you are not filled . You clothe yourselves but you are not warm . You earns wages , only to put them in a purse with holes in it . «
Then Jehovah said : » Consider your ways .
» Go up to the mountain and bring lumber , and rebuild my house . I will take pleasure in it and I will be glorified , « said Jehovah .
» You looked for much harvest and you received little . When you brought it home , I blew it away . Why ? « Said Jehovah of Hosts . » Because my house lies in waste , while each of you run to his house .
» It is because of you that the sky above you withholds the dew , and the earth below withholds its produce .
» I brought drought on the land and its hills , grain fields , vineyards , and olive orchards . Yes drought on every crop the ground produces , on people and animals , on everything you try to grow . «
Governor Zerubbabel and Joshua the High Priest and all the people who returned from the exile in Babylon did what Jehovah God told them to do . They were afraid and obeyed Jehovah’s messenger , Haggai the prophet .
Then Haggai gave Jehovah’s message to the people : » I am with you ! «
Jehovah inspired everyone to work on the Temple . That included : Zerubbabel , the governor of Judah ; Joshua , the High Priest , and all the people who had returned from the exile . They worked on the house of Jehovah of Hosts , their God .
This was on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month of the second year that Darius was king .
On the twenty-first day of the seventh month of that same year , Jehovah spoke again through the prophet Haggai :
» Speak to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , governor of Judah , and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak , the high priest , and to the remnant of the people , saying :
‘ Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory ? How do you see it now ? Is it nothing in your eyes ? ’
» Be strong Zerubbabel , « said Jehovah . » Be strong , Joshua , son of Jehozadak , the high priest . Be strong , all you people of the land , said Jehovah . Work ! I am with you , « said Jehovah of Hosts .
» I gave my word when you came out of Egypt that my Spirit would be with you . Do not fear ! «
Jehovah of Hosts proclaims : » Soon I will shake heaven and earth , land and sea !
» I will shake all the nations and make them afraid . The treasures of all the nations will be brought here . I will fill this house with glory .
» The silver and gold of the world is mine , « said Jehovah of Hosts .
» The glory of this house will be greater than it was before . I will give my people peace . « Jehovah of Hosts has spoken .
On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month of the second year that Darius was king , Jehovah spoke again to the prophet Haggai .
He said : » Ask the priests for a ruling on this question of law .
» A man takes a piece of consecrated meat from a sacrifice and carries it in a fold of his robe . He then lets his robe touch any bread , cooked food , wine , olive oil , or any kind of food at all . Will it make that food consecrated also ? « When the question was asked , the priests answered , » No . «
Then Haggai asked : » This person is defiled because he has touched a dead body . If he then touches any of these foods , will that make them defiled too ? « The priests answered , » Yes . «
Then Haggai said : » Jehovah declared that the same thing applies to the people of this nation and to everything they produce ; and so everything they offer on the altar is defiled . «
» Can you see what has happened to you , « Jehovah asked , » before you started to rebuild the Temple ?
» You would go to a pile of grain looking for twenty bushels , but there would be only ten . You would go to draw fifty gallons of wine from a vat and find only twenty .
» I struck you with scorching winds , mildew and hail to ruin everything you tried to grow , « declared Jehovah , » but you still did not repent .
» Today is the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month , the day that the foundation of the Temple of Jehovah was completed . See what is going to happen from now on .
» There is no grain left . The grapevines , fig trees , pomegranates , and olive trees have not yet produced . However from now on I will bless you . «
Jehovah gave Haggai a second message on that same day , the twenty-fourth of the month .
» Say to Zerubbabel , the governor of Judah : I will shake heaven and earth !
» I will overthrow kingdoms and end their power . I will overturn chariots and their drivers ; the horses will die , and their riders will kill one another . «
» On that day , « declared Jehovah of Hosts , » I will take you , my servant Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel , « declared Jehovah . » I will make you important like a signet signature ring , because I have chosen you , « proclaimed Jehovah of Hosts .
The word of Jehovah came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah , the son of Iddo , the prophet . It was in the eighth month , in the second year of Darius the king :
Jehovah was very angry with your fathers .
Tell them , Jehovah of Hosts has said : » Jehovah of Hosts says return to me and I will return to you . «
» Do not be like your fathers ! The former prophets declared : ‘ Jehovah of Hosts said , I implore you , return from your evil ways , and from your wicked activities ! But they did not listen , they paid no attention to me , ’ « said Jehovah .
» ’ Your fathers , where are they ? ’ ’ The prophets , do they live forever ?
» I commanded my servants the prophets to obey my words and my statutes . They disregarded them and suffered greatly . Then they repented and admitted that I , Jehovah of Hosts , corrected them as they deserved according to their deeds . ’ «
In the second year that Darius was king , on the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month the month of Shebat , Jehovah gave me a message in a vision at night .
He said : » I had a vision in the night . I saw someone riding a red horse . He stopped among some myrtle trees in a valley , and behind him were other horses , red , speckled , and white . «
I asked him , » Sir , what do these horses mean ? « He answered : » I will show you what they mean . «
The man answered : » These are they whom Jehovah sent to inspect the earth . «
They spoke to the Messenger Angel of Jehovah who stood among the myrtle-trees : » We have patrolled the earth and the entire world is at rest . «
Then the Messenger Angel of Jehovah said : » Jehovah of Hosts , how much longer until you show compassion to Jerusalem and the cities of Judah ? You have been angry with them for seventy years . «
Jehovah replied to the angel that talked with me with gracious and comforting words .
The angel said : » Call out , say , this is what Jehovah of Hosts has said : ‘ I am zealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with intense ardor .
‘ And I am very angry with the nations that are at ease secure . I was but a little angered and they caused my anger to grow into fury . ’ «
» Therefore , « said Jehovah : » I will return to Jerusalem with compassion . My house will be built in it , « said Jehovah of Hosts , » and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem . «
» Pronounce again , Jehovah of hosts : ‘ My cities will again overflow with prosperity . Jehovah will comfort Zion and yet choose Jerusalem . ’ «
I lifted up my eyes , and saw , and , behold , four horns .
I questioned the angel : » What are these ? « And he answered me , » These are the horns governments that have scattered Judah , Israel , and Jerusalem . «
Then Jehovah showed me four craftsmen .
I asked : » What did these come to do ? « He answered : » These are the horns that scattered Judah ! No man lifted up his head for these came to terrify them . They will cast down the horns power authority of the nations that lifted up their horn power authority against the land of Judah to scatter it . «
I lifted up my eyes and saw , behold , a man with a measuring line in his hand .
Then I asked : » Where are you going ? « He said to me : » To measure Jerusalem , to see the width and the length of it . «
Behold ! The angel went forth and another angel met him .
He said to him : » Run and speak to this young man , saying , Jerusalem will be inhabited as villages without walls , by reason of the multitude of men and cattle there . «
Jehovah said : » I will become to her a wall of fire around her , and I will be the glory in the midst of her . «
» Flee from the land of the north , « said Jehovah . » I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens , « continued Jehovah .
» Escape Zion ! You who dwell with the daughter of Babylon should escape .
» Jehovah of Hosts proclaims : ‘ He sent me after glory ! He sent me to the nations that plundered you . For he that touches you touches the pupil of his eye . ’
» Behold ! I will shake my hand power over them , and they will be a spoil to those who served them . « Then you will know that Jehovah of Hosts has sent me .
» Sing and rejoice , O daughter of Zion ! For I am coming , and I will dwell in the midst of you , « said Jehovah .
» Many nations will join themselves to Jehovah in that day , and will be my people ! I will dwell in the your midst , and you will know that Jehovah of Hosts has sent me to you . «
Jehovah will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land , and will yet choose Jerusalem .
Be silent , all flesh , before Jehovah , for he is aroused out of his holy dwelling .
He showed me Joshua the high priest . Joshua was standing before the angel of Jehovah , and Satan was standing at his right hand to be his adversary .
Jehovah said to Satan : » Jehovah rebukes you , O Satan ; yes , Jehovah , who has chosen Jerusalem , rebukes you . Is this a brand plucked out of the fire ? «
Joshua was clothed with filthy garments , and was standing before the angel .
He spoke to those who stood before him : » Take the filthy garments from him . Behold , I have caused your iniquity to pass from you and I will clothe you with rich apparel . «
I said : » Let them set a clean headdress upon his head . « So they set a clean headdress upon his head , and clothed him with garments . The angel of Jehovah was standing nearby .
And the angel of Jehovah witnessed to Joshua , saying :
» Jehovah of Hosts said : ‘ If you will walk in my ways , and if you will keep my ordinance you will judge my house and take care of my courts . I will give you free access among these that stand by . ’
» ’ Hear now , O Joshua the high priest , you and your friends who sit before you . They are men that are a sign . I will bring forth my servant the Branch Sprout !
» Look at the stone I set before you Joshua . There are seven eyes on one stone . I will engrave the inscription on it , « said Jehovah of Hosts , » and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day . «
» In that day , « said Jehovah of Hosts , » you will invite every man and his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree . ’ «
The angel who spoke with me returned and woke me from sleep .
He asked : » What do you see ? « I answered : » I see a gold lamp stand , with a bowl on top and seven lamps . There are seven pipes to each of the lamps , which are on the top .
» There are two olive trees beside it . One is on the right side of the bowl and the other is on the left side of the bowl . «
I asked the angel who spoke to me : » What are these , my lord ? «
The angel responded : » Do you not know what these are ? « I said , » No , my lord . «
He answered : » This is the word of Jehovah to Zerubbabel . « Then Jehovah of Hosts said : ‘ Not by might , nor by power , but by my Spirit . ’ «
‘ » Who are you , O Great Mountain ? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain . He will bring the head stone with shouts of blessing . ’ «
The word of Jehovah continued to come to me :
» The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house . His hands will also finish it ! You should know that Jehovah of Hosts has sent me to you .
» For who has despised the day of small things ? For these seven will rejoice , and will see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel . These are the eyes of Jehovah , which run to and fro through the whole earth . «
I said to him : » What are these two olive-trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side of it ? «
I spoke a second time : » What are these two olive branches , that are beside the two golden spouts , that empty the golden oil from themselves ? «
He answered : » You do not know what these are ? « I said , » No , my lord . «
Then he said : » These are the two anointed ones who stand by Jehovah the God of the whole earth ! «
I opened my eyes again and I saw a flying scroll .
He asked me : » What do you see ? « I said : » I see a flying scroll . It is thirty feet long and fifteen feet wide . «
He continued : » This is the curse that is upon the land . Every one who steals will be acquitted . Every one who swears falsely will be innocent . «
» I will cause it to happen , « said Jehovah of Hosts , » and it will enter into the house of the thief , and into the house of he who swears falsely by my name . The curse will abide in the midst of his house and will consume it with the timber and the stones of the house . «
Then the angel said : » Lift up your eyes and see what this is that goes forth . «
I asked : » What is it ? « And he replied : » This is the ephah measure that goes forth . This is their appearance in all the land «
A round flat weight made of lead was lifted up . There was a woman sitting in the midst of the ephah measure .
He said : » This is Wickedness . « He tossed her down into the middle of the ephah measure . He threw the weight of lead on the opening .
Two women came out with the wind in their wings . They had wings like the wings of a stork . They lifted up the ephah measure between earth and heaven .
I asked the angel : » Where are they taking the ephah measure ? «
He answered : » To build her a house temple in the land of Shinar . When it is prepared , she will be moved there to her own place . «
I opened my eyes again and saw four chariots . They came out from between two mountains . The mountains were mountains of copper .
In the first chariot were red horses ; and in the second chariot black horses ;
and in the third chariot white horses ; and in the fourth chariot grizzled strong horses .
Then I asked the angel : » What are these , my lord ? «
The angel answered : » These are the four winds of heaven , which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth .
» The chariot with the black horses goes toward the North Country . The white went forth after them ; and the grizzled went forth toward the South Country .
» The strong ones went forth , and sought to go that they might inspect the earth . « He said : » Go inspect the earth . Search back and forth through out the earth . « So they inspected the earth . They searched back and forth through out the earth .
Then he cried out to me : » Behold ! Those who go toward the North Country have quieted my spirit of anger in the North Country . «
The word of Jehovah continued to come to me :
» Take them into captivity , even Heldai , of Tobijah , and of Jedaiah . The same day go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah . They came from Babylon .
» Take silver and gold and make crowns , and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak , the high priest .
‘ » Say to him : ‘ Jehovah of Hosts says , » See here , the man whose name is the Branch Sprout Shoot Bud . For he will branch out sprout from where he is and he will build the Temple of Jehovah .
» Yes , he will build the Temple of Jehovah . He will receive the glory , and will sit and rule upon his throne . He will be a priest upon his throne and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices .
» And the crowns will be given to Helem , and to Tobijah , and to Jedaiah , and to Hen the son of Zephaniah . This will be for a memorial in the Temple of Jehovah .
» Those who are far off will come and build in the Temple of Jehovah . « You will know that Jehovah of Hosts sent me to you . This will come to pass if you will diligently obey the voice of Jehovah your God . «
The word of Jehovah came to Zechariah in the fourth year of King Darius . It was the fourth day of the ninth month that is Chislev .
Now they of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech , and their men , to request the favor of Jehovah .
Therefore speak to the priests of the house of Jehovah of Hosts , and say to the prophets : » Should I weep in the fifth month , separating myself , as I have done these many years ? «
Then came the word of Jehovah of Hosts to me :
» Speak to all the people of the land and to the priests , saying : ‘ For the past seventy years did you fast for me when you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months ?
‘ » Did you eat for yourselves and drink for yourselves ?
» ‘ Should you hear the words that Jehovah cried by the former prophets , when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity , and the cities near her and the South and the lowland were inhabited ? ’ «
And the word of Jehovah came to Zechariah :
» Jehovah of Hosts has spoken : Every man should execute true judgment , and show kindness and compassion to his brother !
» Do not oppress the widow . Do not oppress the fatherless . Do not oppress the stranger and do not oppress the poor . And you should not devise evil in your heart against your brother .
» They refused to pay heed , turned a stubborn shoulder resisted , and stopped their ears , that they might not hear .
» They made their hearts hard like flint and would not listen to the law , and the words that Jehovah of Hosts sent by his Spirit through the former prophets . Great anger came from Jehovah of Hosts ! «
» ‘ I cried , and they would not listen . Now they will cry , and I will not listen , ’ ’ said Jehovah of Hosts !
‘ I will scatter them with a whirlwind among the nations that they have not known . Thus the land was desolate after them , so that no man passed through nor returned . They tread down the pleasant land and made it desolate . ’ «
The word of Jehovah of Hosts came to me .
Jehovah of Hosts said : » I am zealous for Zion with great ardor , and I am very zealous for her with great rage .
Jehovah of Hosts said : » I have returned to Zion , and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem . Jerusalem will be called the city of truth and the mountain of Jehovah of Hosts , the holy mountain . «
Jehovah of Hosts said : » Old men and old women walk with the help of canes in the streets of Jerusalem . They sit in the city square .
» The streets of the city will be full of boys and girls playing there in the streets . «
Jehovah of hosts proclaims : » If it is marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days , should it also be marvelous in my eyes ? « Said Jehovah of Hosts .
Thus said Jehovah of Hosts : » Behold ! I will save my people from the land of the east and from the land of the west .
» I will bring them and they will live in Jerusalem . They will be my people , and I will be their God , in truth and in righteousness ! «
Jehovah of hosts said : » Let your hands be strong you who hear these words from the mouth of the prophets . These are words from the day that the foundation of the house of Jehovah of Hosts was laid . It was for the purpose of building the Temple .
» Before those days , there was no wage for man or beast . The enemy set everyone against his neighbor and going or coming there was no peace . «
» I will not treat the remnant of this people the same as it was in the former days , « said Jehovah of Hosts .
» There will be peace for the seed . The vine will give its fruit . The ground will yield its increase . The heavens will offer their dew and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things !
» You were a curse among the nations , O house of Judah and house of Israel . I will save you ! You will be blessed . Do not fear ! Be strong ! «
Jehovah of hosts said : » I thought to do evil to you , when your fathers provoked me to anger . I have not relented , « Said Jehovah of Hosts .
» I have again purposed to do good to Jerusalem and the house of Judah . Do not fear ! «
» These are the things that you should do . Every man should speak the truth with his neighbor . Execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates towns .
» Let none of you devise evil in your hearts against his neighbor . Do not love a false oath perjury : for all these are things that I hate , « said Jehovah .
The word of Jehovah of Hosts came to me , saying ,
Jehovah of Hosts said : » The fast of the fourth month , and the fast of the fifth month , the fast of the seventh month , and the fast of the tenth month , will be to the house of Judah joy , gladness , and cheerful feasts . Therefore love truth and peace . «
Jehovah of Hosts said : » It will yet come to pass , peoples , and the inhabitants of many cities will come .
» The inhabitants of one city will go to another , saying , ‘ Let us go speedily to entreat the favor of Jehovah , and to seek Jehovah of Hosts ; I will go also .
» Yes , many peoples and strong nations will come to seek Jehovah of Hosts in Jerusalem , and to request the favor of Jehovah . «
Jehovah of hosts said : » In those days it will come to pass , that ten men out of all the languages of the nations , will take hold of the skirt of the one who is a Jew , saying , We will go with you , for we have heard that God is with you . «
The prophetic utterance of the word of Jehovah upon the land of Hadrach : » Damascus will be its resting-place . The eye of man and of all the tribes of Israel is toward Jehovah .
» Hamath and all that borders on it , including Tyre and Sidon , because they are very wise .
» Tyre built herself a stronghold , and heaped up silver as the dust , and fine gold as the mire of the streets .
» Behold ! Jehovah will evict her , and he will strike her power in the sea ; and she will be devoured with fire .
» Ashkelon will see it and fear ! Gaza will be pained and Ekron will be put to shame . The king will perish from Gaza , and Ashkelon will not be inhabited .
» An illegitimate son will dwell in Ashdod . I will remove the arrogance of the Philistines .
» And I will remove his blood from his mouth , and his detestable things from between his teeth . He will remain for our God . He will be like a chieftain in Judah , and in Ekron like a Jebusite .
» I will encamp about my house against the army . None will pass through or return . No oppressor will pass through them any more : for now I have seen with my eyes .
» Rejoice greatly , O daughter of Zion ! Shout , O daughter of Jerusalem ! Behold , your king comes to you ! He is righteous having salvation . He is humble , and riding upon an ass , even upon a colt the son of a she ass .
» I will destroy the war chariot from Ephraim , and the horse from Jerusalem . The battle bow will be dismantled . He will speak peace to the nations ! His dominion will be from sea to sea , and from the River to the ends of the earth .
» I set your prisoners free from the waterless pit . This is because of the blood of your covenant !
» Return to the stronghold , you prisoners of hope . I declare today : I shall repay you a double portion .
» I bend as my bow , Judah . I filled the bow with Ephraim ! I will stir up your sons , O Zion , against your sons , O Greece . I will make you like the sword of a mighty man .
» Jehovah will be seen over them . His arrow will go forth like lightning ! The Sovereign Lord Jehovah will blow the trumpet and will go with windstorms of the south .
» Jehovah of Hosts will defend them ! They will devour and trample on the sling stones . They will drink and be boisterous with the wine . They will be filled like the sacrificial basins by the corners of the altar .
» Jehovah their God will save them in that day like the flock of his people . They will be like the stones in a crown lifted high over his land .
» How great is his goodness ! How great is his beauty ! Grain will make the young men flourish , and new wine the virgins . «
» In the spring ask Jehovah for rain . It is Jehovah who makes storm clouds and lightning . He will give showers of rain for the vegetation in the field .
» For the teraphim have spoken vanity , and the diviners have seen a lie . They have told false dreams ! They comfort in vain . They go their way like sheep . They are afflicted because there is no shepherd .
» I am angry with the shepherds ! I will punish the male goats . Jehovah of Hosts visited his flock , the house of Judah . He will make them as his majestic horse in the battle .
» The corner stone will come from them . The tent peg will come from them . Every ruler and the battle bow will come from them .
» They will be as mighty men treading down their enemies in the mire of the streets . They will fight in the battle ! Because Jehovah is with them ! The riders on horses will be confounded confused bewildered .
» I will strengthen the house of Judah . I will save the house of Joseph and I will bring them back . I will have mercy upon them ; and they will be as though I had not cast them off . For I am Jehovah , their God , and I will hear them !
» They of Ephraim will be like a mighty man ! Their heart will rejoice as if from wine . Their children will see it , and rejoice ! Their heart will be glad in Jehovah .
» I will whistle for them , and gather them . I have redeemed them and they will increase the same as they have increased .
« I will sow them among the peoples ! They will remember me in far countries . They will live with their children and return .
» I will once again bring them out of the land of Egypt . I will gather them out of Assyria . I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon and a place will not be found for them .
« He will pass through the sea of affliction and will strike the waves in the sea . The depths of the Nile will dry up ; and the pride of Assyria will be removed and the scepter of Egypt will depart .
» I will strengthen them in Jehovah and they will walk in his name , « declared Jehovah .
» Open your doors , O Lebanon , that the fire may devour your cedars .
» Wail , You fir tree , for the cedar has fallen , because the majestic ones are destroyed . Wail you oaks of Bashan , for the strong forest has come down .
» Listen to the wailing of the shepherds ! Their glory is destroyed ! Listen to the roaring of young lions ! The pride of the Jordan is laid waste . «
Jehovah my God said : » Feed the flock doomed to slaughter .
» Their owners slay them and claim they are not guilty . They that sell them say : Blessed be Jehovah , for I am rich and their own shepherds do not pity them .
» I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land , « said Jehovah . » I will deliver every one into his neighbor's hand , and into the hand of his king . They will strike the land , and out of their hand I will not deliver them .
» So I fed the poor of the flock of slaughter . I took two staffs ; the one I called Beauty , and the other I called Bands ; and I fed the flock .
» And I eliminated the three shepherds in one month . I was tired of them , and they also abhorred me found me repugnant .
» Then I said , ‘ I will not feed you ! If you die go ahead and die . Let those that are left eat each other ! «
So I took my staff , Beauty , and broke it in pieces that I might break my covenant that I had made with all the peoples .
It was broken in that day . In this way , the poor of the flock listened to me and knew that it was the word of Jehovah .
I said to them , » If it is good in your sight give me my wages , if not forget it . « So they paid me thirty pieces of silver .
Jehovah said to me , » Throw it to the potter , « the amount they paid me . I took the thirty pieces of silver , and threw them to the potter , in the house of Jehovah .
I broke my other staff in pieces . It was the one I called Bands . That way I broke the brotherhood between Judah and Israel .
Jehovah said : » Take yet again the instruments of a foolish shepherd .
» Warning ! I will allow a shepherd in the land , who will not visit those who are perishing , and will not seek those that are scattered . This shepherd will not heal that which is broken , nor feed that which is hungry . He will eat the flesh of the fat sheep , and will tear their hoofs in pieces .
» Woe to the worthless shepherd that leaves the flock ! The sword will be upon his arm , and upon his right eye . His arm will be withered and dried up , and his right eye will be blind . «
The prophetic utterance of the word of Jehovah concerning Israel . Jehovah declared : » Who stretches forth the heavens ? Who lays the foundation of the earth ? Who forms the spirit of man within him ?
» I will make Jerusalem a cup that causes trembling to the people in the nations nearby . Judah will also be attacked when they attack Jerusalem .
» It will happen in that day ! I will make Jerusalem a heavy weight for all the people . All who lift it will be severely injured . All the nations of the earth will gather against her . «
» In that day , « said Jehovah , » I will strike every horse with terror and his rider with madness ! I will watch the house of Judah . Every horse of the people will be struck with blindness .
» The people of Judah including the leaders will say in their hearts : The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength through Jehovah of Hosts their God .
» I will make the people of Judah like a pan of fire among wood and like a flaming torch among sheaves of grain . They will consume all the peoples on the right hand and on the left all around . The inhabitants of Jerusalem will again dwell in their own place , in Jerusalem .
» Jehovah will save the dwellings of Judah first . The glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not be magnified above Judah .
» In that day Jehovah will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem . He that is feeble among them will be like David . For the house of David will be like God , like the angel of Jehovah before them .
» It will happen at that time . I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem .
» I will pour upon the house of David , and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem , the spirit of kindness and of supplication . They will look to the one whom they pierced ; and they will mourn for him , as one mourns for his only son . There will be a bitter lamentation for him , like one who grieves for his first-born .
» That day will be a great mourning in Jerusalem , like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the Valley of Megiddon Megiddo .
» And the land will mourn , every family by itself ; the family of the house of David by itself , and their wives by themselves , the family of the house of Nathan by itself , and their wives by themselves .
» The family of the house of Levi will mourn by itself , and their wives by themselves ; the family of the Shimeites by themselves , and their wives by themselves ;
» All the remaining families and their wives will mourn by themselves .
» A fountain for sin and for uncleanness will be opened for the house of David . «
Jehovah of Hosts declared : » I will remove the names of the idols from the land ! They will no longer be remembered . I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to leave the land .
» It will happen when any attempt to prophesy , the father and mother who gave birth to him will say to him : You will not live , for you speak lies in the name of Jehovah . They will stab him through when he prophesies .
» It will happen ! The prophets , each one of them will be ashamed of his vision and his prophesy . They will not wear a hairy mantle to deceive .
» He will say I am no prophet ! I am a tiller of the ground . I have been made a slave from my youth .
» One will ask him : What are these wounds between your arms ? He will answer : Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends .
» Awake , O sword , against my shepherd , and against the man that is my fellow neighbor companion , said Jehovah of Hosts : Strike the shepherd , and the sheep will be scattered ! I will turn my hand upon against the little ones .
» It will happen in all the land , « said Jehovah , » two parts will be cut off and die ; but the third will be left .
» I will bring the third part into the fire . I will refine them , as silver is refined , and I will test them as gold is tested . They will call on my name , and I will hear them . I will say : ‘ It is my people ! ’ ’ They will say : ‘ Jehovah is my God ! « ’
» Behold ! A Day of Jehovah comes , when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you .
» I will gather all nations to battle against Jerusalem ! The city will be defeated . The houses will be plundered and the women raped ! Half of the city will be taken into captivity . The remainder of the people will not be removed from the city .
» Then Jehovah will go forth and fight against those nations . It will be just as when he fought in the day of battle .
» His feet will stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives , which is before Jerusalem on the east . The Mount of Olives will be split in half toward the east and toward the west . There will be a very large valley . Half of the mountain will move toward the north , and half of it toward the south .
» You will flee by the valley of my mountains . For the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel . Yes you will flee the same as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah . Jehovah my God will come , and all the holy ones with him .
» It will happen ! There will be no light for the bright ones will withdraw themselves !
» It will be a day known to Jehovah . It will not be day and it will not be night , but there will light in the evening .
» It will happen ! Living waters will go out from Jerusalem : half of them toward the eastern sea , and half of them toward the western sea . It will be both in the summer and in the winter .
» Jehovah will be King over all the earth . Jehovah will be the only one and his name will be the only one in that day .
» All the land will be made like the Arabah , from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem . Jerusalem will be lifted up , and will dwell in her place , from Benjamin's gate to the place of the first gate , to the corner gate , and from the tower of Hananel to the king's winepresses .
» People will live there and there will be no more curses . Jerusalem will dwell safely .
» The plague will be that Jehovah will strike all the peoples that have gone to war against Jerusalem ! Their flesh will wither away while they stand upon their feet , and their eyes will wither away in their sockets , and their tongue will wither away in their mouth .
» It will happen ! A great tumult trouble disturbance from Jehovah will fall on them . Everyone of them will lay hold on the hand of his neighbor , and his hand will rise up against the hand of his neighbor neighbor will fight against neighbor .
» Judah will also fight at Jerusalem . The wealth of all the nations round about will be gathered together , gold , and silver , and apparel , in great abundance .
» This will be the plague of the horse , of the mule , of the camel , and of the donkey , and of all the beasts that will be in those camps , as that plague .
» Every one that is left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King , Jehovah of Hosts , and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles .
» There will be no rain on those who do not go to Jerusalem to worship the King , Jehovah of Hosts .
» If the family of Egypt does not go it will not be upon them . There will be the plague and Jehovah will strike the nations that do not go to keep the Feast of Tabernacles .
» This will be the punishment of Egypt , and the punishment of all the nations that do not keep the Feast of Tabernacles .
» In that day it will be on the bells of the horses , HOLY UNTO JEHOVAH . And the pots in Jehovah's house will be like the bowls before the altar .
» Yes , every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to Jehovah of Hosts ! Every thing they sacrifice will be boiled in them . In that day there will be no more Canaanites in the House of Jehovah of Hosts . «
This is Jehovah’s Word , a divine revelation to Israel through His Messenger , Malachi :
» I have loved you , « said Jehovah . You replied : » How have you loved us ? « » Was Esau Jacob's brother ? « Responded Jehovah : » Yet I loved Jacob .
» And yet I hated Esau and his descendants . I devastated Esau's hill country and abandoned his inheritance to the desert jackals . «
Esau's descendants , the Edomites , say : » Our towns have been destroyed , but we will rebuild them . « Thus Jehovah will reply : » Let them rebuild . I will tear them down again . People will call them the evil country . They are the nation with whom Jehovah has a long lasting anger .
The people of Israel will see this with their own eyes . They will say : Jehovah is mighty even outside the land of Israel ! «
Jehovah of Hosts declares to the priests : » Children honor their parents and servants honor their masters . I am your father . Why do you not honor me ? I am your master . Why do you not respect me ? You despise me , and yet you ask : How have we despised you ? «
» This is how you despise me . You offer worthless food on my altar . Then you ask : ‘ How have we failed to respect you ? ’ ’ I tell you it is by showing contempt for my altar .
» You bring blind , sick and lame animals to sacrifice to me . Do you think there is nothing wrong with that ? Try giving an animal like that to the governor ! Would he be pleased with you or grant you any favors ?
» Try asking God to show you favor . He will not answer your prayer ! It will be your fault , « Jehovah the Almighty declares .
Jehovah of Hosts continues : » Is there one among you who will shut the Temple doors to prevent lighting a useless fire on my altar . I am not pleased with you ! I will not accept the offerings you bring me .
» Where ever the sun rises and sets my name will be great among the people of the nations . Incense will be offered to my name everywhere . It will be a pure offering ! For my name will be great among the nations , « said Jehovah of Hosts .
» You profane it by saying : ‘ The table of Jehovah is polluted and the fruit and food on it is contemptible . ’
» And you say : ‘ We are tired of all this ! ’ ’ You turn up your nose at me . You offer the lame and the sick and even stolen animals , « said Jehovah . » Do you think I will accept that from you ?
» The cheater who sacrifices a worthless animal to me will be cursed . For he has in his flock a good animal that he promised to give me ! I am a great King , « Jehovah of Hosts declares . » People of all nations will respect my name ! «
[ Jehovah God the Almighty speaks to the priests : ] This command is for you .
» You must honor me by your actions . If you will not listen to what I say , and give glory and honor to my name , I will bring a curse on you . I will put a curse on the things you receive for your support . I have already put a curse on you . Your blessings are cursed already because you do not take my command seriously .
» I will punish your children and rub your faces in the dung of the animals you sacrifice ! You will be taken away with the dung heap of your feasts .
» You will know I sent this commandment to you ! This way my covenant with Levi will continue , « said Jehovah of Hosts .
» My covenant was with him Levi . It was of life and peace . I gave them to him that he might reverence me . He respected me and stood in awe of my name .
» The law of truth was in his mouth . Unrighteousness was not found in his lips . He walked with me in peace and uprightness . He turned many away from iniquity .
» The priests should teach the true knowledge of God . They are the messengers of Jehovah of Hosts . Therefore the people should learn my will the law from them .
» You priests have turned away from the right path . Your teaching has led many to do wrong . You have corrupted the covenant I made with Levi you .
» I caused you to be despised and low before all the people . You are contemptible and do not keep my ways . You show partiality when applying the law . «
» Do we all have one father ? Did one God create us ? Why do we deal treacherously with one another ? Why do we profane the covenant of our fathers ?
» The people of Judah have done wrong . They deal treacherously and committed an abomination in Israel and in Jerusalem . Judah has profaned the holiness of Jehovah by marrying the daughter of a foreign god .
» Jehovah will remove from the community of Israel those who did this . They will never again participate in the national offerings to Jehovah of Hosts .
» Another thing you do is drown Jehovah’s altar with tears , weeping and wailing . This is because he no longer accepts the offerings you bring him .
» You ask : Why do you not accept our offerings ? It is because Jehovah is a witness between you and the wife of your youth . The one to whom you have been unfaithful ! She is your companion , the wife of your marriage vows .
» Did God make you one ? Your flesh and spirit belong to him . What does God look for but godly descendants ? Do not be unfaithful to the wife of your youth .
‘ » I hate divorce and he who covers his garment with violence , ’ ’ said Jehovah , the God of Israel . Jehovah of Hosts declares : ‘ Guard yourselves and do not deal treacherously . ’ «
» You have made Jehovah weary with your words . You ask : ‘ How have we wearied him ? ’ ’ You say : ‘ Every one that does evil is good in Jehovah’s sight . ’ ’ You also say : ‘ He delights in them . ’ ’ Then you ask : ‘ where is the God of justice ? « ’
» Behold , I send my messenger ! He will prepare the way before me . Seek Jehovah ! He will suddenly come to his Temple along with the messenger of the covenant . He is one you desire , behold , he comes , « said Jehovah of Hosts .
» Who can endure the day of his coming ? Who can stand when he appears ? He is like a refiner's fire and like laundry soap the lye of laundrymen .
» He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver . He will purify the sons of Levi , and refine them like gold and silver . Then they will offer to Jehovah offerings in righteousness .
» The offerings of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasant to Jehovah like it was in the old days , in ancient years .
» I will approach you people for judgment ! I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers , the adulterers and those acting fraudulently with the wages of the worker , the widow and the fatherless . I will be a speedy witness against those who swear falsely and take advantage of the stranger , and do not show me reverence , « said Jehovah of Hosts .
» I am Jehovah . I have not changed ! You are the sons of Jacob . You have not yet been destroyed !
» Like your fathers before you , you have turned away from my laws and have not obeyed them . Return to me and I will return to you , « said Jehovah of Hosts . » But you ask , ‘ how will we return to you ? ’
» I ask you : ‘ will you rob and defraud God ? Of course not , yet you are robbing and defrauding me ! ’ ’ ‘ How have we robbed and defrauded ? ’ ’ You ask . ‘ In the matter of tithes and offerings . ’
» A curse is on all of you because the whole nation is cheating me .
» Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse . Test me , said Jehovah of Hosts , and see if I will open the windows of heaven and pour out showers of blessing upon you until there is no more want .
» I will not let insects destroy your crops . Your grapevines will produce abundantly .
» All the nations will pronounce you happy because your land will be a good place to live .
» You have said terrible things about me , « said Jehovah of Hosts . » Yet you ask : ‘ What have we said about you ? ’ «
» You have said : ‘ There is no value to serve God . What is the use of doing what he says or of trying to show Jehovah of Hosts that we are sorry for what we have done ? ’
» We call arrogant people happy . Evil people test God’s patience with their wicked deeds . They not only get away with it , they also prosper . «
Those who respected Jehovah spoke to one another , and Jehovah listened to what they had to say . In his presence a memorial record was written down in a book listing those who reverence Jehovah and respect esteem regard his name .
» They will be my people , « said Jehovah of Hosts . » On the day when I act , they will be mine my special treasure my jewels . I will show them compassion just as parents show compassion to the children who serve them .
» Once again my people will see the difference between the righteous and the wicked , between the person who serves God and the one who does not . «
Jehovah of Hosts proclaims : » The day is coming when all arrogant and evil people will burn like stubble . On that day they will burn up and there will be nothing left of them , either root or bough .
» The sun of righteousness with it’s healing will shine on you who respect my name and obey me . You will be free and paw the ground like fat calves . «
» When I act you will tread down the wicked . They will be like dust under your feet , « Jehovah of Hosts said .
» You should remember the Law of Moses my servant . I commanded the statutes and ordinances regulations and judgments to him at Horeb for all Israel .
» Behold ! I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible Day of Jehovah comes .
» He will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children , and the hearts of the children to their fathers and bring them together again before I come and strike the earth with destruction a curse . «

Uzziah the father of Jotham , Jotham the father of Ahaz , Ahaz the father of Hezekiah ,
Hezekiah the father of Manasseh , Manasseh the father of Amon , Amon the father of Josiah .
Josiah was the father of Jechoniah and his brothers . They lived at the time when the people were exiled to Babylon .
After the exile to Babylon , Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel . Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel ,
Zerubbabel the father of Abiud , Abiud the father of Eliakim , Eliakim the father of Azor ,
Azor the father of Zadok , Zadok the father of Achim , Achim the father of Eliud ,
Eliud the father of Eleazar , Eleazar the father of Matthan , Matthan the father of Jacob .
Jacob was the father of Joseph , who was the husband of Mary . Mary was the mother of Jesus , who is called Christ the Anointed .
So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David , fourteen generations from David until the exile to Babylon , fourteen generations from the exile until the Messiah .
The birth genesis : origin beginning of Jesus Christ was as follows : His mother Mary had been promised to Joseph in marriage . But before they were married , Mary realized that she was pregnant by Holy Spirit .
Her husband Joseph was an honorable man and did not want to disgrace her publicly . So he decided to break the marriage agreement with her secretly .
Joseph had this in mind when God’s angel appeared to him in a dream . The angel said to him : » Joseph , descendant of David , do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife . She is pregnant by Holy Spirit .
» She will give birth to a son , and you will name him Jesus » Jehovah is salvation « , because he will save his people from their sins . «
All this happened so that what God spoke through the prophet came true :
» The virgin will become pregnant and give birth to a son , and they will name him Immanuel , « which means : » God God-like one is with us . «
When Joseph woke up , he did what the angel of God had commanded him to do . He took Mary to be his wife .
He did not have marital relations with her before she gave birth to a son . Joseph named the child Jesus .
Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea during the reign of King Herod . Astrologers arrived in Jerusalem from the east .
They asked : » Where is the newborn king of the Jews ? We saw his star in the east and came to offer him praise . «
King Herod was troubled when he heard this . Jerusalem was also troubled .
He called together all the chief priests and teachers of the Law and asked where will the Messiah be born ?
» Bethlehem in Judea , « they answered . This is what the prophet wrote :
» Bethlehem in the land of Judah , you are not the least of the leading cities of Judah . A leader will come out of you . He will shepherd my people Israel . «
Then Herod secretly called the astrologers to find out exactly the time the star appeared .
He sent them to Bethlehem . He said : » Search diligently for the young child . When you find him , bring me word so I may come and bow down to him also . «
After they heard the king , they followed the star until it stopped over the place where the child was .
They were overwhelmed with joy to see the star .
They entered the house and saw the young child with his mother Mary . They bowed down and paid him homage . Then they opened their treasure chests and offered gifts of gold , frankincense and myrrh .
God warned the astrologers in a dream not to go back to Herod . So they departed for their country by a different road .
When they left , the angel of God appeared to Joseph in a dream and said : » Herod is looking to kill the young child . Arise , take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt . Stay there until I tell you to leave . «
Joseph took the child and his mother to Egypt .
They did not return until the death of Herod . The words spoken by Jehovah through the prophet were fulfilled : » I called my son out of Egypt . «
Herod saw that the astrologers tricked him and he was furious . He sent soldiers to kill all the boys two years old and younger in or near Bethlehem . This matched the time he learned from the astrologers .
Jeremiah’s prophecy came true :
» A sound was heard in Ramah , the sound of crying in bitter grief . Rachel is weeping for her children . She would not be comforted , because they were dead . «
After Herod died God’s angel appeared in a dream to Joseph who was in Egypt .
The angel told him : » Take the child and his mother and go to Israel . Those who tried to kill the child are dead . «
Joseph took the child and his mother to Israel .
When he heard that Archelaus succeeded his father , Herod , as king of Judea , Joseph feared going . Warned in a dream , he left for Galilee instead .
He made his home in Nazareth . Thus the prophecy came true : » He Jesus will be called a Nazarene . «
John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness of Judea , proclaiming :
» Repent , for the kingdom of heaven has come near . «
Isaiah spoke of John when he said : » He is a voice shouting in the wilderness : ‘ Prepare the way of Jehovah . Make his paths straight . ’ «
John wore clothes made from camel’s hair . He had a leather belt around his waist . He ate locusts and wild honey .
People from Jerusalem , Judea , and the whole Jordan Valley went to him .
They confessed their sins and were baptized by John in the Jordan River .
He saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism . » You offspring of vipers , « he said , » who warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
» Bear fruit worthy of repentance !
» Do not presume that Abraham is your father . I tell you that God can make descendants for Abraham from these stones !
» The ax is ready to cut down the trees at the roots . Every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire .
» I baptize you with water because of your repentance . He that comes after me is mightier than I . He will baptize you with Holy Spirit and fire . I am not even good enough to carry his sandals .
» His winnowing shovel is in his hand . He will clean his threshing floor and gather his wheat into a barn . He will then burn the husks in a fire that cannot be put out . «
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John .
» I need to be baptized by you , « John said . » Why are you coming to me ? «
Jesus answered emphatically : » This is the proper way to do everything that God requires . This is the way it must be ! «
Then Jesus was baptized and came up from the water . Suddenly the heavens were opened . He saw God’s Spirit coming down like a dove .
Then a voice from heaven said : » This is my Son whom I love and whom I have approved . «
God’s Spirit led Jesus into the desert wilderness . There he was tested tempted by the Devil .
He fasted forty days and nights , and was very hungry .
Satan , the Tempter , said to him : » If since you are the Son of God order these stones to turn into bread . «
In reply Jesus answered : » It is written ; man shall not live on bread alone , but on all everything every word every utterance every declaration that proceeds from the mouth of Jehovah . «
Then the Devil took him into the holy city and had him stand on top of the Temple .
» If since you are the Son of God , throw yourself down . The Scriptures say : ‘ God will give orders to his angels about you and they will hold you with their hands , so that not even your feet will strike the ground . ’ «
» Again it is written , « Jesus replied , » ‘ you must not put Jehovah your God to the test . ’ «
This time the Devil took Jesus to an extremely high mountain . He showed him all the kingdoms of the world with all their greatness .
» I will give all this to you , « the Devil told Jesus , » if you kneel down and worship me . «
» Go away , Satan ! « demanded Jesus . » It is written , » It is Jehovah your God you must worship , and it is to him alone you must render sacred service . ’ «
Then the Devil left Jesus , and the angels came and served him .
Jesus heard that John had been arrested . So Jesus withdrew to Galilee .
He left Nazareth to reside at Capernaum , a town by Lake Galilee , in the districts of Zebulun and Naphtali .
Thus the prophecy revealed to Isaiah would be fulfilled :
» O land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali , along the road of the sea , on the other side of the Jordan , Galilee of the nations !
» the people sitting in darkness saw a great light . Light rose upon those sitting in a region of deathly shadow . «
From that time on Jesus preached this message : » Repent for the Kingdom of heaven is near . «
Jesus walked on the shore of the Sea of Galilee . There he saw Simon , who is called Peter , and Andrew his brother . They were fishermen .
He said to them : » Follow me and I will teach you to catch people . «
At once they abandoned their nets and followed him .
He saw two other brothers , James , the son of Zebedee , and John his brother . They were in the boat with Zebedee their father , mending their nets . He called them .
Instantly they left the boat and their father , and went with him .
Jesus walked all over Galilee teaching in the synagogues . He preached the Good News about the Kingdom . He also healed every kind of disease and infirmity among the people .
News about him spread throughout the country of Syria . People sick and suffering from diseases , people with demons , epileptics and paralytics , came to him . Jesus healed them all .
Because of this , large crowds followed him from Galilee , Decapolis , Jerusalem , Judea , and the land on the other side of the Jordan .
Seeing great masses of people , he went up to the mountain . When he was seated his disciples came to him .
He opened his mouth and taught them :
» Blessed Greek : makarios : happy , blessed are those conscious of their spiritual need , for the kingdom of heaven is theirs .
» Blessed are those who mourn , for they will be comforted .
» Blessed are the meek gentle mild humble , for they will inherit the earth .
» Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness , for they will be filled .
» Blessed are the merciful and compassionate , for they will receive mercy and compassion .
» Blessed are the pure in heart , for they will see God .
» Blessed are the peacemakers , for they will be called the children of God .
» Blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness sake , for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven .
» Blessed are you when men revile you , and persecute you , and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake .
» Rejoice , and be filled with joy , for great is your reward in heaven . The prophets , who came before you , were also persecuted .
» You are the salt of the earth . If its taste goes away , how will you restore it ? It is good for nothing . All you can do is throw it on the ground and walk on it .
» You are the light of the world . A town built on a hill may be seen by all .
» A light is not placed under a cover . To the contrary , it is placed on a table so all may see .
» Likewise , let your light shine before men , that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven .
» Do not think I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets . I came , not to destroy , but to fulfill perfect execute accomplish .
» I solemnly tell you , heaven and earth would pass away before one small letter detail will pass away from the Law . All things must be accomplished .
» Whoever disobeys even the least of the commandments and teaches others to do the same , will be called least in the kingdom of heaven . On the other hand whoever obeys and teaches others to obey the Law will be called great in the kingdom of heaven .
» I also tell you , your righteousness must be greater than the scribes and Pharisees or you will not enter into the kingdom of heaven .
» You were told in the past , do not murder kill . Any one who murders will be brought to trial .
» Now I tell you that everyone who is angry with his brother without cause shall be guilty before the court . Whoever speaks to his brother with words of contempt shall receive condemnation before the Sanhedrin Supreme Court . Curse your brother and you will be guilty enough to be destroyed by fire , with the burning trash , at the Valley of Hinnom , outside of Jerusalem Greek : Gehenna .
» When making an offering at the altar and you remember your brother has something against you ,
» leave your gift at the altar and go make peace with your brother . Then return and make your offering .
» Come to an agreement quickly with the one who has a legal case against you . Do it before he turns the case over to the judge and you are thrown into jail .
» Take it from me ; you will stay in jail until you pay the very last penny of your fine .
» You have heard it was said , ‘ You should not commit adultery . ’
» However , I tell you that whoever looks at a woman with lustful thoughts commits adultery with her in his heart .
» If your right eye causes you to sin , take it out and throw it away ! It is better to lose a part of your body then to have your whole body destroyed in the ever-burning fires of the Valley of Hinnom .
» If your right hand causes you to sin , cut it off and throw it away . It is better to lose part of your body , than for your whole body to be destroyed in the ever-burning fire . Figuratively : lose prospect for everlasting life ; ever-burning fire means total destruction .
» Again , it was said , ‘ Whoever gets rid of his wife has to give her a certificate of divorce . ’
» I say to you that everyone divorcing his wife , except for the reason of fornication , makes her liable to commit adultery . And if she marries again , the man she marries also commits adultery .
» You were also told that you should keep a promise oath . Always keep your promises vows to Jehovah .
» I tell you , offer no promises at all , not by heaven , because it is God’s throne .
» Not by earth , for it is the footstool under His feet . Not by Jerusalem , for it is the city of the great King .
» And do not promise by your head , for you cannot even control the hair on your head .
» Let your answer be ‘ Yes’ or ‘ No . ’ ’ Anything more than this is from the evil one .
» You have heard it said , an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth .
» But I tell you , do not resist a wicked person . If someone strikes you on the right cheek , turn the other to that person .
» If someone takes you to court to sue you and takes your shirt , let him have your coat as well .
» Whoever makes you go one mile , go with him two .
» Give to those who ask . Lend to those who borrow .
» You have heard it said , ‘ You should love your neighbor and hate your enemy . ’
» I say love your enemies ! Pray for those who persecute you !
» You will then act as true children of your Father in heaven . He gives sunlight to both evil and good people . He sends rain for the just and the unjust .
» What good is there , when you love only those who love you ? Even corrupt tax collectors do that !
» When you are kind only to your friends and brothers what makes you different from anyone else ? Even people of the nations do that .
» Be perfect mature , even as your Father in heaven is perfect mature .
» Be careful ! Do not display your righteousness good works before men to be noticed by them . If you do , you will have no reward with your heavenly Father .
» Do not loudly announce it when you give to the poor . The hypocrites do this in the houses of worship and on the streets . They do this to be praised by men . Believe me , they have already been paid in full .
» When you give gifts , do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing .
» Your giving will be in secret and your Father who sees in secret will reward you .
» Do not pray like the hypocrites ! They want everyone to see them in the houses of worship and on the street corners . I assure you they have been paid in full .
» Go to your room and close the door . Privately pray to your Father . When your Father sees you he will reward you .
» Large quantities of meaningless words and repetition are not acceptable in prayer . The pagans think their gods will hear long and repetitious prayers .
» Do not be like them . Your Father knows what you need before you ask him .
» ‘ Our Father in heaven , holy is your name .
» ‘ Your kingdom come , your will be done on earth as it is in heaven .
» ‘ Give us this day our daily bread .
» ‘ Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us .
» ‘ And lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil the wicked one . ’
» If you forgive others their sins , your heavenly Father will also forgive you .
» If you do not forgive others , your Father will not forgive your sins .
» When you abstain from food , do not be like the hypocrites , with sad faces to be seen by men . They have received their reward .
» Anoint your head and wash your face .
» That way , men may not see that you are fasting . Your Father knows in secret and will reward you .
» Do not accumulate large amounts of wealth on earth . This is where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal .
» Accumulate wealth in heaven where neither moth nor rust consumes , and where thieves do not break in and steal .
Your heart will be where you keep your wealth .
» The eyes are like a lamp for the body . If your eye is clear simple focused single minded , your whole body will be full of spiritual light .
» But if your eye is wicked , your body will be in darkness . If that light in you is really darkness , how great a darkness it must be .
» You cannot serve two masters . You will hate one and love the other . You will be loyal to one master and despise the other . You cannot serve both God and money wealth material possessions .
» I tell you , do not worry about your life , what you will eat or drink . And do not worry about your body , what you will wear . Is life worth more than food ? And is the body worth more than clothes ?
» Look at the birds of the sky , they do not sow , nor reap , nor gather into barns . Your heavenly Father feeds them . Are you worth more than they ?
» Can you live longer by worrying about it ?
» Why are you worried about clothing ? Look at how the lilies of the field grow . They do not toil . They do not spin .
» I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was dressed like these .
» If God clothes the grass of the field , which is here today , and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace , won ’ t he care for you even more ? You of little faith !
» Do not worry ! Do not say : ‘ What shall we eat ? ’ ’ or , ‘ What shall we drink ? ’ ’ or , ‘ What shall we wear ? ’
» All people go in search of these things . Your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things .
» Seek desire require serve first the kingdom of God and his righteousness continuously and all these things will be added to you .
» Do not worry about tomorrow , for tomorrow will have its own worries . Sufficient for each day is its own badness .
» Stop judging , so that you will not be judged .
» As you judge , so you will be judged . As you measure , it will be measured to you .
» Why do you see the speck in your brother’s eye ? Do you not consider the beam in your own eye ?
» Will you tell your brother , ‘ I will remove the speck from your eye ’ ’ when there is a beam in your own eye ?
» You hypocrite ! First remove the beam out of your own eye . Then you can see to remove the speck out of your brother’s eye .
» Do not give holy things to the dogs impure persons false prophets . Do not throw your pearls before swine the most unclean . They will trample them under their feet and turn and tear you to pieces .
» Ask and it will be given you . Seek and you will find . Knock and it will be opened for you .
» Everyone who asks receives . Everyone who seeks finds , and everyone who knocks will have it opened .
» Who among you , who would give his son a stone when he asks him for bread ?
» Who will give him a serpent when he asks for a fish ?
» Even though you are a sinner , you know how to give good gifts to your children . Think how much more your Father in heaven gives good things to those who ask him !
» Do for others the same as you would have them to do for you . That is the meaning of the Law and the Prophets .
» Enter through the narrow gate , since the gate to destruction is wide and the road that leads to destruction is wide and many enter through it .
» Narrow is the gate and difficult is the way to life . Only a few put forth the effort . Yes , only a few people enter the narrow gate .
» Watch out for the false prophets . They are disguised as sheep . But in their hearts they are vicious wolves .
» By their fruits you will know them . Do men get grapes from thorns or figs from thistles ?
» Every good tree gives righteous fruit . The bad tree gives evil fruit .
» A good tree does not give bad fruit . A bad tree does not give good fruit .
» Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire .
» Therefore by their fruits you will know them .
» Not everyone who calls me Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven . He who does the will of my Father in heaven will enter .
» Many will say to me in that day , ‘ Lord , Lord , did we not prophesy in your name , and cast out demons in your name , and do many mighty works in your name ? ’
» I will say to them , ‘ I never knew you . Depart from me , you workers of evil . ’
» Everyone who hears my words , and does them is like a wise man that builds his house on a rock .
» The rain descended , and the floods came , and the winds blew and beat upon that house ; and it did not fall . It was built on a solid rock foundation .
» Every one who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man , who built his house upon the sand .
» The rain descended , and the floods came , and the winds blew and battered the house and it fell with a great crash . «
When Jesus had finished these words , the crowds were astonished at what he taught .
He taught them as one having authority , and not as their scribes .
When Jesus came down from the mountain , large crowds followed him .
A leper came to him and bowed down before him , saying : » Lord , if you want to , you can make me clean . «
He reached out his hand and touched him , saying : » I want to . Be made clean . « Right away his leprosy was cleansed .
Jesus told him not to tell anyone . » Show yourself to the priests and offer the gift that Moses commanded , for a testimony to them . «
When he entered Capernaum , a centurion captain of one hundred men approached him .
He said : » Lord , my servant is lying paralyzed at home and terribly tormented . «
Jesus said to him : » I will come and heal him . «
The centurion replied to Jesus : » Lord , I am not worthy that you come under my roof . Say the word and my servant will be healed .
» I also am a man having authority and commanding soldiers . I say to this one , ‘ Go , ’ ’ and he goes ; and to another , ‘ Come , ’ ’ and he comes ; and to my servant , ‘ Do this , ’ ’ and he does it . «
When Jesus heard it , he was amazed , and said to the crowd : » I tell you , I have not found such great faith in Israel .
» I tell you , many will come from the east and the west , to sit down with Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , in the kingdom of heaven :
» but the sons of the kingdom will be cast forth into the outer darkness : there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . «
Jesus said to the centurion : » Go . Just as you believe , so it will be done to you . « The servant was healed in that hour .
Jesus went to Peter’s house . He saw his wife’s mother lying sick of a fever .
He touched her hand and the fever left her . She arose , and ministered to him .
That evening , they brought many people possessed with demons to him . He cast out the spirits with a word , and healed all that were sick .
In so doing , that which was spoken through Isaiah was fulfilled . Isaiah wrote : » He took our sicknesses and removed our diseases . «
Now when Jesus saw how large the crowd was growing , he gave orders to depart to the other side of the lake .
A scribe came to him and said : » Teacher , I will follow you wherever you go . «
Jesus replied : » Foxes have holes , and the birds of heaven have nests , but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head . «
One of his disciples said : » Lord , first allow me to go bury my father . «
But Jesus said to him : » Follow me ; and leave the dead to bury their own dead . «
When he entered a boat , his disciples followed him .
Suddenly a storm blew in and the boat was covered with waves . Jesus was asleep .
And they came to him , woke him , and cried : » Save us , Lord , or we will perish . «
He said to them : » Why are you afraid , you of little faith ? « Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea . Suddenly there was a great calm .
The disciples were in awe . They asked : » What kind of man is this , for even the winds and the sea obey him ? «
When he arrived at the other side of the lake in the country of the Gadarenes two men possessed by demons came to him from out of the tombs . They were extremely violent , so no man could pass by that way .
They screamed at him , saying : » What have we to do with you , Son of God ? Have you come to torment us before the time ? «
A large herd of swine was feeding in the distance .
The demons pleaded with him : » If you cast us out , send us into the herd of swine ! «
He told them to go . And they came out , and went into the swine . The entire herd rushed down the hill into the sea , where they perished in the waters .
The herdsmen fled to the city to tell everything that happened to the swine that were possessed with demons .
Everyone in the city came out to meet Jesus . They begged him to go away from their country .
Jesus entered a boat and crossed over to his own city Capernaum , on the other side of the lake .
A man on a bed , a paralytic , was brought to Jesus . Seeing their faith Jesus said to the sick man : » Have courage ; your sins are forgiven . «
Some of the scribes said among themselves : » This man has no respect for God . «
Knowing their thoughts , Jesus said : » Why are your thoughts evil ?
» Which is easier , to say , your sins are forgiven , or to say , get up and walk ? «
So that you know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins he turned and spoke to the paralytic or paralyzed man : » Get up , take your bed and go to your house . «
He arose , and departed to his house .
But when the people saw it , they marveled , and glorified God who had given such authority to men .
Jesus moved on . He then saw Matthew seated at his work collecting taxes . He said to him : » Follow me . « He rose and followed him .
Jesus was a dinner guest at Matthew’s house . Many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples .
When the Pharisees saw it , they asked his disciples : » Why does your Teacher eat with the tax collectors and sinners ? «
When he heard it , he said : » People who are well do not have need of a physician . The sick do .
» You should learn what this means : ‘ I desire mercy , and not sacrifice ’ ; for I came , not to call the righteous , but sinners . «
The disciples of John asked : » Why do your disciples not fast ? « They frequently fasted , and so did the Pharisees .
Jesus replied : » Should the wedding guests mourn and also celebrate with the groom ? The days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them . Then they will fast .
» Why patch an old garment with cloth that has not been shrunk ? The patch shrinks and pulls away from the old cloth leaving a big hole .
» Neither do men put new wine in old wineskins . The skins burst and the wine is lost . They put new wine in fresh wineskins , and both are preserved . «
While he was speaking , an official came and paid him respect . He said : » By now my daughter must be dead . Come and lay your hand on her and she will live . «
Jesus and his disciples got up and followed him .
A woman who had a hemorrhage chronic flow of blood for twelve years came behind him . She touched the border of his garment .
She said to herself : » If I touch his garment , I will be healed . «
Jesus turned to see her and said : » Daughter , take courage ; your faith has made you well . « The woman was healed at that time .
Jesus went into the official’s house and saw flute players and the crowd making a lot of noise .
He told them to leave : » For the girl is not dead , but sleeps . « They all scornfully laughed at him .
The people were sent away . He went to the girl , took hold of her hand , and she got up .
The news about this spread to all the land .
Jesus left that place and walked along the road . Two blind men followed him . They shouted : » Have mercy on us , Son of David ! «
He went into a nearby house . The blind men followed him . Jesus asked them : » Do you believe that I can heal you ? « They said : » Yes Lord . «
He touched their eyes . » Let it be done , « he said , » according to your faith . «
Their eyes were opened . Jesus strictly warned them : » Do not let anyone know about this . «
They spread the news about Jesus all over that part of the country .
Next , a dumb man possessed with a demon was brought to him .
When the demon was cast out , the dumb man spoke . The crowd marveled , saying : » We have never seen anything like this in Israel ! «
The Pharisees complained : » He casts out demons with the help of the ruler of the demons . «
Jesus went to all the cities and the villages , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the good news of the kingdom . He healed every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity .
When he saw the large crowds of people , he was moved with compassion for them . He knew they were distressed and scattered like sheep not having a shepherd .
Jesus said to his disciples : » The harvest is abundant , but the laborers are few .
» Pray that the Lord of the harvest will send out workers into his harvest . «
He called his twelve disciples . He gave them power to cast out unclean spirits and to heal all kinds of disease and sickness .
The following are the names of the twelve apostles ambassadors of the good news messengers : first , Simon , who is called Peter , and Andrew his brother ; James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother ;
Philip and Bartholomew ; Thomas , and Matthew the tax collector ; James the son of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus ;
Simon the Cananaean , and Judas Iscariot , who later betrayed him .
Jesus sent the twelve . He gave them orders not to go to the people of the nations and not to go to the Samaritans .
He said : » Go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
» Preach as you go ! Announce the kingdom of heaven , for it is near .
» Heal the sick , raise the dead , cleanse the lepers , and cast out demons . You received without paying , now give without being paid .
» Do not take gold , silver , or copper money in your money belt .
» Take no extra clothes , not even two coats , no extra shoes or walking stick for the laborer is worthy of his food .
» Go into a city or village and search for the worthy ones . Stay with them until you are ready to leave .
» When you enter the house , offer a blessing of peace .
» If the people are worthy , let your blessing stand . If they are not worthy , let your peace return to you .
» If someone will not welcome you and listen to the message , leave that house or town , shake the dust off your feet and move on .
» I tell you , it will be better for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment , than for that town .
» I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves . Be wise as serpents and harmless as doves .
» Beware of men ! They will take you to court ! They will have you beaten in their meeting places .
» You will be taken before governors and kings for my sake . This will serve as a testimony to them and to the people of the nations .
» When they hand you over , do not worry about what to say and how to say it . You will be given the words to speak at that time .
» You will not speak on your own . Your Father’s Spirit will speak through you .
» People will hand over their brothers to be put to death . Parents will oppose children and children will oppose parents , causing them to be put to death .
» Men will hate you because of me . He who endures to the end will be saved .
» When they persecute you in this city , flee to the next . I tell you ; before you have gone through all the cities of Israel the Son of man will come .
» A disciple is not greater than his teacher , nor a servant his master .
» It is enough for the disciple student that he is like his teacher , and the servant like his master . If they called the master of the house Beelzebub Satan , others of the household could also be called the same !
» Do not be afraid . Nothing will be hidden . Every secret will be made known .
» The things I tell you in darkness , speak in the light . Proclaim everything you hear from on top of the house .
» Do not fear those who kill the body . They are not able to take away your everlasting life . Instead , fear him who is able to destroy both life and body in the ever-burning fires . Greek : Gehenna : continuously burning trash fires in the valley of Hinnom .
» Do two sparrows sell for a penny ? Not one of them will fall on the ground without your Father knowing .
» Even the hairs of your head are all numbered .
» Do not fear ! You are more valuable than many sparrows .
» I will tell my heavenly Father about everyone who confesses me witnesses to others about me before men .
» I will deny , before my heavenly Father , anyone who denies me before men .
» Do not think I came to bring peace on the earth . I came not to bring peace , but a sword .
» My coming will cause a separation . A man will be against his father and a daughter against her mother , and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law .
» A man’s enemies will be from his own family .
» He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me . He who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me .
» Anyone who does not pick up his stake and follow me is not worthy of me .
» Whoever finds his life will lose it . Whoever loses his life for my sake will find it .
» He who receives you receives me , and he who receives me receives him who sent me .
» Anyone who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward . Anyone who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive a righteous man’s reward .
» And whoever gives a drink of cold water to one of these little ones because he is a disciple , truly , I say to you , he will not lose his reward . «
When Jesus finished instructing his twelve disciples , he left to teach and preach in their cities .
While in prison , John heard news of what Christ was doing . He sent his disciples .
They asked Jesus : » Are you the Expected One or should we look for another ? «
And Jesus answered : » Go tell John the things you hear and see .
» The blind receive their sight . The lame walk ! The lepers are cleansed , and the deaf hear . The dead are raised up , and the poor have good news preached to them .
» Blessed and happy is he who is not offended by me . «
When these men left , Jesus spoke to the crowds about John . » What did you go into the wilderness to find ? Did you look for a reed shaken by the wind ?
» What did you expect to see , a man clothed in fancy clothes ? Those who wear fancy clothes are in king’s houses .
» Did you go to see a prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and much more than a prophet !
» This is he of whom it is written : ‘ Behold , I send my messenger ahead of you . He will prepare the way for you . ’
» I tell you , there is none , born of women , greater then John the Baptist . Yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he .
» From the days of John the Baptist until now , the kingdom of heaven has been man’s goal , and men of violence have attempted to take it by force .
» For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John .
» If you are willing to receive it , this is Elijah , who is to come .
» He who has ears to hear let him listen !
» Of what shall I compare this generation ? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces , who call to their playmates .
» They say : ‘ We piped for you and you did not dance . We cried and you did not mourn . ’
» For John came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , ‘ He has a demon . ’
» The Son of man came eating and drinking , and they say , ‘ A gluttonous man and a drunkard , a friend of tax collectors and sinners ! ’ ’ Wisdom is justified by its actions . «
Then he denounced the cities where most of his mighty works were done , because they did not repent .
» Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! If the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon that were done in you , they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes .
» I say to you , It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the Day of Judgment than for you .
» Will you , Capernaum , be exalted into heaven ? You will go down into the grave . If the mighty works had been done in Sodom , which were done in you , it would have remained until this day .
» But I say to you , It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the Day of Judgment , than for you . «
Then Jesus prayed : » I thank you , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth . You have hidden these things from the wise and understanding , and have revealed them to children .
» Yes , Father , for it was very pleasing in your sight .
» All things have been delivered to me from my Father . Only the Father knows the Son , and only the Son knows the Father . The Son tells others about the Father so that they can know him too .
» Come unto me , all you who labor and are heavily burdened , and I will give you rest .
» Take my yoke upon you , and learn from me . I am meek mild and humble in heart . You will have a restful life ,
» for my yoke is easy and my burden is light . «
Jesus’ disciples were hungry . It was Sabbath day and yet Jesus and his disciples went through the grain fields plucking ears and eating them .
The Pharisees saw it and said to him : » Your disciples do that which it is not lawful to do on the Sabbath . «
He replied to them : » Have you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry ?
» He entered into the house of God , and he and his companions ate the showbread holy bread , which it was not lawful for them to eat . It was only lawful for the priests .
» Have you read the law that on the Sabbath day the priests in the Temple profane the Sabbath , and are guiltless ?
» I say to you , one greater than the Temple is here .
» If you had known what this means , ‘ I desire mercy and not sacrifice , ’ ’ you would not have condemned the guiltless .
» For the Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath . «
He left and went into their synagogue .
There he saw a man who had a withered hand . They asked him if it is lawful to heal on the Sabbath day ? They wanted to accuse him .
He said to them : » Which of you having one sheep , if this sheep fell into a pit on the Sabbath day , will not get it and lift it out .
» How much more value is a man than a sheep ! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day ! «
Then he said to the man : » Stretch out your hand . « He stretched it out and it was restored whole like the other .
The Pharisees left and took counsel against him , to decide how they might destroy him .
Jesus was aware of this and withdrew from the place . Many followed him and were healed by him .
He warned them not to tell anyone where he was .
This fulfilled what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet .
» Look ! My servant whom I have chosen . I am well pleased with him . I will put my Spirit upon him and he will declare judgment to the nations .
» He will not quarrel , nor cry aloud . None will hear his voice in the streets .
» He will break a bruised reed . He will quench smoking flax . This he will do until he sends forth judgment to victory .
» The nations will hope in his name ! «
Someone possessed with a demon , blind and dumb was brought to him . He healed him and the dumb man spoke and could see .
The crowds were amazed , and said : » Can this be the son of David ? «
When the Pharisees heard it , they said : » This man casts out demons by Beelzebub , the prince of the demons . «
Knowing their thoughts , he said to them : » Every kingdom divided against itself is destroyed . Every city or house divided against itself will not stand .
» If Satan casts out Satan , he is divided against himself . How will his kingdom stand ?
» If I cast out demons by Beelzebub , by whom do your sons cast them out ? Let them be your judges .
» But if I cast out demons by God’s Spirit , then the kingdom of God has come to you .
» How can one enter into the house of a strong man and steal his things , except he first tie up the strong man ? Then he can rob his house .
» He that is not with me is against me . And he that does not gather with me , scatters .
» Therefore I say to you , every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men . But the blasphemy against God’s Spirit will not be forgiven .
» Whoever speaks a word against the Son of man , it shall be forgiven him . But whoever speaks against Holy Spirit , it shall not be forgiven him , neither in this age , nor in that which is to come .
» Either make the tree good , and its fruit good , or make the tree corrupt , and its fruit corrupt . The fruit a tree produces provides its reputation .
» You offspring of vipers . How can you who are evil speak good things ? Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks .
» The good man performs good things out of his good treasure . The evil man performs evil things out of his evil treasure .
» I tell you there will be an account in the Judgment Day for every careless word that men say .
» For by your words you will be justified , and by your words you will be condemned . «
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him , saying : » Teacher , we want to see a sign from you . «
He answered them : » An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign . No sign will be given but the sign of Jonah the prophet .
» Just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the huge fish , so the Son of man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth the grave .
» The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it . After all , they repented at the preaching of Jonah . Yet someone greater than Jonah is here .
» The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation , and condemn it . She came from the ends of the earth to hear the Wisdom of Solomon . Someone greater than Solomon is here !
» When an unclean spirit goes out of a man it passes through the desert seeking rest . It does not find it .
» It tries to return to the place from where it came . It finds it empty , swept , and fixed up .
» Then it takes along seven other spirits more evil than itself . They enter in and dwell there . The last state of that man becomes worse than the first . It will also be like this with this evil generation . «
While Jesus was yet speaking to the crowds , his mother and his brothers stood nearby . They wanted to speak to him .
Someone told Jesus : » Look , your mother and your brothers stand nearby seeking to speak to you . «
But he answered : » Who is my mother ? Who are my brothers ? «
He stretched out his hand towards his disciples , and said : » Behold , my mother and my brothers !
» For everyone who does the will of my Father who is in heaven is my brother , and sister , and mother . «
That day Jesus left the house and sat by the seashore .
Large crowds gathered to him . He entered a boat while the crowd stood on the shore .
He told them many illustrations . He said : » A farmer went out to sow .
» Some seeds fell by the roadside , and the birds devoured them .
» Others fell on rocky places and did not have much soil .
» When they grew , the sun scorched them , and because they had no root they withered and died .
» Others fell upon the thorns . The thorns grew up and choked them .
» Some fell on good ground and yielded fruit , some a hundredfold , some sixty , and some thirty .
» He that has ears let him hear . «
The disciples asked him : » Why do you speak in illustrations ? «
He responded : » You are allowed to know the divine secrets of the kingdom of heaven , but it is not for others to know . The Greek word for » you « is plural and is applied to the disciples as a group .
» He who has shall receive more to the point of abundance . He who does not have , it shall be taken away including that which he has .
» I speak to them in illustrations stories parables allegories , because seeing they do not see , and hearing they do not hear . They just do not understand .
» The prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled . ‘ By hearing , you shall hear , and shall in no way understand . By seeing you shall see , and shall in no way perceive .
» ‘ The heart of this people is callous and dull . Their ears are plugged . They cannot hear . They closed their eyes and cannot see . They cannot see nor hear nor understand with their heart . They should turn around and I would heal them . ’
» Happy and blessed are your eyes , for they see ; and your ears , for they hear .
» Truly , I tell you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things that you see , and could not see them . They also desired to hear the things that you hear , and could not hear them .
» Listen to the illustration of the sower .
» When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand , the evil one takes away that which was sown in his heart . This is what was sown by the roadside .
» Anyone sown among the rocky places hears the word and immediately with joy receives it .
» There is no root in him . He endures for a while . When he has tribulation or persecution because of the word , he falls away .
» He that was sown among thorns hears the word . The cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word , and he becomes unfruitful .
» He that was sown upon the good ground hears the word , and understands it . He bears fruit , producing sometimes a hundredfold , sometimes sixty , and sometimes thirty . «
He told another illustration , saying : » The kingdom of heaven is like a man that sowed good seed in his field .
» While he slept , his enemy came and sowed weeds with the wheat , and went away .
» When the blade sprouted and brought forth fruit , it looked like wheat .
» The servants of the householder said to him : ‘ Sir , did you sow good seed in your field ? Why does it have weeds mixed in with the good wheat ? ’
» He replied : ‘ An enemy did this . ’ ’ The servants offered to remove the weeds .
» He said : ‘ No , you might uproot the wheat with them .
» ‘ Let both grow together until the harvest . In the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers : » Gather weeds first , and bind them in bundles to burn them . Then gather the wheat into my barn . « ’ «
In another illustration Jesus said : » The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man sowed in his field .
» Mustard seed is the smallest of all seeds . Yet when it grows it becomes as large as a tree . In fact the birds of heaven lodge in the branches . «
He offered another illustration : » The kingdom of heaven is similar to leaven . A woman hid leaven in three measures of meal until it was all leavened . «
Jesus spoke with illustrations to the crowds . He did not speak anything without using illustrations .
That which was spoken through the prophet was fulfilled , saying : » I will open my mouth in illustrations . I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world . «
Then he left the crowds and went into the house . His disciples gathered near him . They said : » Explain to us the illustration of the weeds in the field . «
Jesus said : » He that sows the good seed is the Son of man .
» The field is the world the society of mankind . The good seed are the sons of the kingdom . The weeds are the sons of the evil one .
» The enemy that sowed them is the Devil . The harvest is the end of the age . The reapers are angels .
» The weeds are gathered up and burned destroyed with fire . It will be this way at the end of the age .
» The Son of man will send his angels , and they will gather out of his kingdom all who stumble others and commit lawlessness .
» The angels will cast them into the furnace of fire , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
» The righteous will shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father . He that has ears let him hear .
» The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field . A man found the treasure and hid it again in the field . He is so filled with joy he sells everything he owns and buys the field .
» The kingdom of heaven is also like a merchant seeking valuable pearls .
» When he found one pearl of great value , he sold all that he had , and bought it .
» The kingdom of heaven is like a net cast into the sea . It gathered fish of every kind .
» They drew it up on the beach when it was full . They gathered the good into containers and threw away the bad .
» It will be that way at the end of the age . The angels will come forth , and separate the wicked from among the righteous .
» The wicked will be cast into the furnace of fire where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
» Have you understood all these things ? « They said to him : » Yes . «
And he said to them : » Every scribe journalist writer who has been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like a man that is a householder , who brings out of his treasure things new and old . «
After Jesus finished telling these illustrations , he left .
He went to his own country and taught in the synagogue . They were astonished and asked where this man got this wisdom and these mighty works .
» Is this man the carpenter’s son ? Is his mother called Mary ? Are his brothers James and Joseph , Simon , and Judas ?
» Are his sisters all with us ? Where did he get all these things ? «
They resented him . But Jesus responded to them : » A prophet is without honor in his own country , and in his own house . «
He did not do many mighty works there because of their lack of faith .
At that time Herod , the ruler of Galilee , heard the news about Jesus .
He told his servants : » This is John the Baptist , raised from the dead . That explains the power working in him . «
Herod locked John in prison to please Herodias , his brother Philip’s wife .
For John had said to him : » It is not lawful for you to have her . «
Herod wanted to put him to death but he feared the people since they believed John was a prophet .
It was Herod’s birthday . The daughter of Herodias danced for him and pleased him .
So he promised with an oath to give her anything she wanted .
Prompted by her mother , she said : » Give me John the Baptist’s head on a platter . «
The king was grieved . He gave his oath and many were watching so he commanded that it be done .
He gave the order to behead John in prison .
His head was brought on a platter to the young lady . She in turn gave it to her mother .
John the Baptist’s disciples took the corpse and buried him , and then came and told Jesus .
When Jesus heard it , he left in a boat to a secluded place . The crowds heard this and followed him on foot from the cities .
He saw the great crowd , had compassion on them , and healed their sick .
Evening came and the disciples approached Jesus and said : » This place is desolate . Send the people away so they may go to the villages and buy themselves food . «
Jesus told them : » They have no need to go away : you feed them . «
They remarked : » We have only five loaves , and two fishes . «
» Bring them to me , « Jesus replied .
He commanded the crowd to sit down on the grass . Then he prayed . He gave the five loaves and two fishes to the disciples to distribute to the crowd .
And they all had plenty to eat . In fact they had twelve baskets full of food left over .
About five thousand men , plus women and children ate .
Jesus sent the disciples in a boat to the other side of the sea . He stayed there until he sent the crowd away .
After sending the crowd away , he went to the mountain to pray by himself . He was there alone that night .
But the boat was now in the middle of the sea . The wind and the waves caused great trouble .
Just before morning , Jesus walked to them on the water .
When they saw him walking on the water they were troubled . » It is a spirit apparition illusion ! « they screamed ! They cried out with fear .
At once Jesus said : » It is I ; do not be afraid . «
Peter said to him : » Lord , if it is you , give me the order to come to you on the water . «
He said : » Come . « Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus .
When he noticed how strong the wind was , he became afraid . He began to sink , and cried : » Help me Lord ! «
Suddenly , Jesus put out his hand and took hold of him , and said : » You of little faith , why were you in doubt ? «
The wind went down when they got into the boat .
Those on the boat loved him intensely , saying : » Truly , you are the Son of God ! «
They came to land at Gennesaret .
When the men of that place heard the news about Jesus they told everyone in the country . The sick were taken to him .
They wanted to touch his robe to be made well .
Pharisees and scribes from Jerusalem came to Jesus .
They questioned him : » Why do your disciples go against the teaching of the fathers ? They eat food with unwashed hands . «
His answer to them was in the form of a question : » Why do you go against the word of God in favor of your tradition ?
» God said , ‘ Honor your father and mother . ’ ’ ‘ He who says evil of father or mother will be put to death . ’
» You teach that a man should tell his father or mother that what he has that could help them , is given to God .
» You say there is no need for him to give honor to his father . You have invalidated the word of God because of your tradition !
» You hypocrites liars ! Isaiah’s prophecy was right about you .
» ‘ These people honor me with their lips , but their heart innermost thoughts is far from me .
» ‘ But their worship is to no purpose , while they give as their teaching the rules commands of men . ’ «
He got the people together and said to them : » Listen , and let my words be clear to you .
» That which comes out of the mouth makes a man unclean , not that which goes into the mouth . «
The disciples told him the Pharisees were upset by what he said .
In answer he replied : » Every plant my Father in heaven has not planted in the earth will be pulled out by the roots .
» Let them be . They are blind guides . If a blind man guides another blind man , they will fall in a hole together . «
Then Peter said to him : » Make the story clear to us . «
He replied : » Are you , like them , without wisdom ?
» Do you not see , that which goes into the mouth , goes into the stomach and is sent out as waste ?
» That which comes out of the mouth , comes from the heart and makes a man unclean .
» Evil thoughts come from the heart ! Thoughts about murder , adultery , fornication , theft , lying , and slander come from the heart !
» These things make a man unclean . Eating food with unwashed hands does not make a man unclean . «
Jesus went away from there into the country of Tyre and Sidon .
A woman of Canaan came crying and saying : » Have pity on me , O Lord , Son of David ; my daughter is greatly troubled with an unclean spirit . «
He did not answer her . His disciples said to him : » Send her away ; she keeps shouting at us . «
He answered : » I was sent only to the wandering sheep of the house of Israel . «
She bowed down before him and asked for help .
He said : » It is not right to take the children’s bread and give it to the dogs . «
She said : » Yes , Lord ; but even the dogs take the scraps from under their masters’ table . «
» O woman , « Jesus replied , » your faith is great ! Let your desire be done . « And her daughter was made well from that hour .
Jesus went from there to the Sea of Galilee . He went up into the mountain and sat down .
Many people came to him . They brought those who were lame , crippled , blind , mute , and many other people . They laid them down at his feet and he healed them .
The people marveled as they saw the mute speak , the crippled and lame walk , and the blind see . They glorified the God of Israel .
Jesus called his disciples and said : » I feel compassion for the people , because they have remained with me now three days and have nothing to eat . I do not want to send them away hungry , for they might faint on the way . «
The disciples replied : » Where would we get so many loaves in this desolate place to satisfy such a large crowd ? «
Jesus asked : » How many loaves do you have ? « They said : » Seven , and a few small fish . «
He told the people to sit down on the ground .
He took the seven loaves and the fish and offered a prayer of thanksgiving . Then he broke them and gave them to the disciples . The disciples gave them to the people .
They all ate and were satisfied . When they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces , there were seven large baskets full .
Four thousand men , besides women and children were fed .
After dismissing the crowds , Jesus took a boat to the region of Magadan .
The Pharisees and Sadducees tested Jesus by asking him to show them a sign from heaven .
He said to them , » At nightfall you say the weather will be good , for the sky is red .
» And in the morning , the weather will be bad today for the sky is red and angry . You are able to see the face of heaven , but not the signs of the time .
» An evil and false generation is searching after a sign . However , no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah . « Then he left them .
The disciples came from the other side of the sea . They did not think to obtain bread .
Jesus said : » Take care to have nothing to do with the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees . «
They reasoned among themselves , saying : » We took no bread . «
Hearing this , Jesus said : » You of little faith , why are you reasoning among yourselves about not having bread ?
» Do you still not see or remember the five cakes of bread of the five thousand , and the number of baskets you took up ?
» Or the seven cakes of bread of the four thousand , and the number of baskets you took up ?
» Why do you not understand I was not talking about bread ? Instead , about keeping away from the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees ? «
Then they realized it was not the leaven of bread he had in mind . It was the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
Jesus traveled to parts of Caesarea Philippi . He asked his disciples : » Who do men say that the Son of man is ? «
They said : » John the Baptist , Elijah , Jeremiah , or one of the prophets . «
» Who do you say that I am ? «
Simon Peter answered : » You are the Christ , the Son of the living God ! «
Jesus answered him : » Bless you , Simon son of John . This knowledge came from my Father in heaven and not from man .
» You are Peter Greek : petros : piece of rock , and on this rock-mass Greek : petra : mass of rock referring to Jesus I will build my congregation . The entrance to the grave Greek : Hades will not have power to stop it .
» I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven . Whatever you declare to be improper and unlawful on earth must be what is improper and unlawful in heaven , and whatever you declare lawful on earth must be lawful in heaven . «
He gave orders to the disciples to tell no man he was the Christ .
From that time forward Jesus made it clear to his disciples how he would have to go to Jerusalem . He told them he would undergo much at the hands of the authorities , including the chief priests and scribes . He let them know he would be put to death . The third day he would come back from the dead .
Peter protested and rebuked Jesus . He said : » Do not think of that , Lord ; it will never happen to you . «
He turned to Peter and said : » Get behind me , Satan . You are a stumbling block to me . You think the things of men , not of God . «
Then Jesus told his disciples : » If any man wants to follow me be mine , let him deny disown himself , and take up his stake and follow me Greek : akoloutheo moi , let him be following me accompany me be in the same way with me .
» He who wants to save his life will lose it . He who is willing to lose his life for my sake will find it .
» What will a man profit , if he gains the whole world , and gives up his life ? What will a man give in exchange for his life ?
» The Son of man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels . He will then reward each man according to his deeds .
» I tell you truly , there are some that stand here who will not experience death till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom . «
After six days Jesus took Peter , James , and John his brother up into a high mountain alone .
While they watched , Jesus’ appearance changed transformed transfigured in their presence . His face was as bright as the sun and his clothes became as white as the light .
Moses and Elijah appeared , and they were talking to him .
Peter told Jesus : » Lord , it is good for us to be here . If you want , let us make three tents here : one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . «
While he was still speaking , a bright cloud overshadowed them . A voice came out of the cloud , saying : » This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased . Listen to him . «
When the disciples heard it , they fell on their faces . They were very afraid .
Jesus touched them and told them to get up and not be afraid .
They saw only Jesus when they opened their eyes .
When they came down from the mountain , Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone what they saw , until the Son of man has risen from the dead .
His disciples asked him : » Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first ? «
In answer he said : » Elijah truly has to come and put all things right .
» I tell you that Elijah has come . They did not know him and treated him badly as they pleased . They will do the same with the Son of man . «
Then the disciples saw that he was telling them about John the Baptist .
When they approached the people , a man fell to his knees before him , saying :
» Lord , have mercy on my son . He has mental problems and is in great pain . He frequently falls into the fire and into the water .
» I took him to your disciples , and they were not able to make him well . «
Jesus answered : » You unbelieving and perverted generation , how long will I be with you ? How long must I put up with you ? Bring him to me . «
Jesus ordered the unclean spirit to leave the boy . It left him and the boy was made well immediately .
Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said : » Why were we not able to send it out ? «
He told them : » It was because of your lack of faith : Truly I say to you , if you have faith as small as a grain of mustard seed , you will say to this mountain , move and it will move . Nothing will be impossible to you . «
While they were traveling in Galilee , Jesus said to them : » The Son of man will be given up into the hands of men .
» They will put him to death . The third day he will be raised from death . « They were very sad .
They arrived at Capernaum . The collectors of the two-drachma tax asked Peter : » Does your master make payment of the Temple tax ?
He said : » Yes . « When he entered the house , Jesus said to him : » What is your opinion , Simon ? Who pays the tax assessed by the kings of the earth ? Is it from their sons or from other people ? «
When he said : » From other people , « Jesus replied : » Are the sons free of tax ?
» We will not cause them trouble . Go to the sea , and let down a hook , and take the first fish you catch . You will see money a stater coin in its mouth . Give it to them for me and for you . «
In that hour the disciples came to Jesus . They asked : » Who is greatest in the kingdom of heaven ? «
He took a little child and put him in the middle of them .
He said : » Truly I tell you , if you do not have a change of heart and become like little children , you will not go into the kingdom of heaven .
» He who humbles himself to become like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven .
» Everyone who accepts this little child in my name accepts me .
» He who causes one of my faithful little ones to stumble is in trouble . It would be better for him to end up in the deep sea with a great stone tied to his neck .
» A curse is on the earth because of stumbling ! It is necessary for stumbling to come . Unhappy is that man through whom the stumbling comes .
» If your hand or your foot is a cause of stumbling cut it off . Get rid of it . It is better for you to go into life with the loss of a hand or a foot than , having two hands or two feet , to be destroyed by eternal fire .
» If your eye causes you stumbling , take it out and throw it away . It is better for you to go into life with one eye than , having two eyes , to be destroyed in ever-burning fires in the Valley of Hinnom Greek : Gehenna .
» Do not treat these little ones badly . I tell you that angels represent them in the presence of my Father in heaven .
» What do you think ? A man has a hundred sheep , and one of them has gone wandering away . Will he leave the ninety-nine and go in search of the wandering one ?
» When he finds it , I tell you he will be filled with more joy than he would have if he had stayed with the ninety-nine .
» Even so , your Father in heaven does not want any of these little ones to be lost .
» If your brother does wrong to you , go to him in private . Clearly explain his error between you and him . If he listens to you , you have gained your brother back .
» If he does not listen to you , take one or two more people with you . Two or three witnesses may prove every case .
» If he will not listen to them , let it come to the attention of the congregation . If he will not listen to the congregation , let him be to you as a heathen and a tax collector .
» I tell you ; whatever things are fixed by you on earth will be declared improper and unlawful in heaven . Whatever you make free on earth will be declared lawful in heaven .
» Again , I say to you , that if two of you are in agreement on earth about anything for which they will make a request , it will be done for them by my Father in heaven .
» Where two or three are gathered together in my name , there I am in their midst . «
Peter came to him and said : » Lord , How many times may my brother do wrong against me , and I forgive him ? Seven times ? «
Jesus said to him : » Not seven times ; but seventy times seven .
» The kingdom of heaven is like a king who went over his accounts with his servants .
» First , one came to him who owed him ten thousand talents .
» He was not able to make payment . So his lord gave orders for him to be sold . His wife , sons , and daughters were all to be sold along with every possession . The money would be used for payment of what he owed .
» So the servant fell on his face out of respect . He said : ‘ Lord , give me time to make payment and I will pay everything . ’
» Being moved with pity , the lord let him go , and made him free of the debt .
» Then that servant met another servant who was in debt to him for one hundred denarii . He took him by the throat , saying , ‘ Pay your debt now . ’
» That servant fell down before him , saying , ‘ Give me time and I will make payment to you . ’
» He would not give him time . He put him into prison till he paid the debt .
» When the other servants saw what happened , they were very sad . They told their lord what had been done .
» His lord sent for him , and said : ‘ Evil servant ; I made you free of all that debt , because of your request to me .
» ‘ Should you also show mercy to your fellow servant the same way I showed mercy to you ? ’
» His lord was angry and sent him to jail to be punished until he paid back all of his debt .
» My heavenly Father will treat you like that if you do not forgive your brother from your heart . «
When Jesus finished speaking , he departed from Galilee . He went to the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan .
Large crowds followed him , and he healed many of them .
Pharisees came to him . They tested him , asking : » Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason ? «
He answered : » Have you not read , that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female ?
» For this reason , a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife . The two shall become one flesh .
» So they are no longer two , but one flesh . What God has joined together , let no man pull apart separate ! «
They asked him : » Why then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce , to send her away ? «
He answered : » Moses allowed you to send your wives away because of your hardness of heart . It was not allowed from the beginning .
» I tell you , whoever divorces his wife , except for fornication , and marries another , commits adultery . And he who marries her when she is divorced , commits adultery . «
The disciples said to him : » This being the case between a man and his wife , it is better not to marry . «
He said : » This does not apply to everyone , only to those God has given it to .
» For there are men who , from birth , were without sex . There are some who were made that way by men . There are others who have made themselves so for the kingdom of heaven . He who is able to accept this let him accept it . «
Then some people brought little children to him . They wanted him to lay his hands on them and bless them . But the disciples tried to stop them .
Jesus said : » Let the little ones children come to me . Do not keep them away : for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these . «
He put his hands on them , and then went on his way .
One man said : » Master , what good thing must I do , so that I may have eternal life ? «
Jesus answered him : » Why are you questioning me about what is good ? There is one who is good . If you desire life , obey the Law . «
The man replied : » Which law ? « And Jesus said : » Do not murder , do not commit adultery , do not steal , do not give false witness ,
» Honor your father and your mother , and Love your neighbor as yourself . «
The man said to him : » I have done all these things ; what more is there ? «
Jesus then replied : » If you wish to be complete , go sell your possessions and give the money to the poor . You will have wealth in heaven . Then follow me ! «
But hearing these words , the young man went away grieving , for he was very wealthy .
Jesus said to his disciples : » Truly I tell you , it is hard for a man with much money to go into the kingdom of heaven .
» Again I say , It is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye , than for a man with much money to go into the kingdom of God . «
The disciples were greatly surprised when they heard this . » Who , then , may have salvation ? « they asked .
Jesus looked at them and said : » With men this is not possible . All things are possible with God ! «
Then Peter said : » See , we have given up everything to follow you . What then will we have ? «
Jesus replied : » Truly I say to you , when all things are made new , and the Son of man is seated in his glory , you who have come after me will be seated on twelve seats , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
» Everyone who has given up houses , or brothers , or sisters , or father , or mother , or child , or land , for my name , will receive many times as much , and have everlasting life .
» Many who are first will be last . Some who are last will be first . «
» The kingdom of heaven is like the master of a house , who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard .
» He made an agreement with the workmen for a penny a day . Then he sent them into his vineyard .
» He went out the third hour and saw others in the marketplace doing nothing . «
» He said to them : ‘ Go to the vineyard with the others . I will pay you whatever is right . ’ ’ So they went to work .
» He went out the sixth and the ninth hour , and did the same .
» The eleventh hour , he saw others doing nothing . He asked : ‘ Why are you here all the day doing nothing ? ’
» They said : ‘ No man has given us work . ’ ’ He told them to go work with the rest in the vineyard .
» When evening came , the lord of the vineyard said to his manager : ‘ Let the workers come and pay them from the last to the first . ’
» Those men who went to work at the eleventh hour were each given a penny .
» Those who worked longer , expected to be paid more . They were also given a penny .
» When they got it , they protested against the master of the house .
» They said : ‘ The last ones have done only one hour’s work . You have made them equal to us . We have undergone the hard work of the day and the burning heat . ’
» He told them : ‘ I do you no wrong . You made an agreement with me for a penny .
» ‘ Take what is yours and leave . I wish to give to the last workers the same as to you .
» ‘ Is it lawful for me to do what I wish with what is mine ? Or is your eye jealous because I am generous ? ’
» So the last will be first , and the first last . «
When Jesus went to Jerusalem , he took the twelve disciples aside and talked to them .
» When we get to Jerusalem , « he said , » The Son of man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes . They will give orders for him to be put to death .
» They will turn him over to the heathen to be made sport of and to be whipped . He will be put to death on the stake . The third day he will come back from the dead . «
The mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons . She bowed down and requested a favor of him .
» What is your desire ? « he asked . She said to him : » Let my two sons be seated , the one at your right hand , and the other at your left , in your kingdom . «
Jesus told her : » You have no idea what you are requesting . Are you able to take of the cup I am about to take ? »
They said : » We are able . « » Truly , you will take of my cup , « he said . » But to be seated at my right hand and at my left is not for me to give . It is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father . «
When the ten heard it , they were angry with the two brothers .
Jesus called them to himself and said : » You know that the rulers of the nations exercise absolute dominion over them . They lord it over them and behave like tyrants .
» But it will not be so among you . He who will be great among you must be your servant .
And he who will be first among you will be your attendant servant minister .
» The Son of man came not to be ministered to , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom in payment for many . «
A great crowd followed him when they departed from Jericho .
Two blind men sitting by the side of the road heard Jesus pass by and cried out : » Have mercy on us , O Lord , Son of David ! «
The crowd told them to be quiet . But they cried even more , saying : » Have mercy on us , O Lord , you Son of David ! «
Jesus stood still and asked them : » What do you want me to do to you ? «
They said : » Lord give us our sight . «
Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes . Now they could see ! So they followed him .
They were near Jerusalem at Bethphage . Jesus sent two disciples to the Mount of Olives .
He told them , » Go to the nearby town and look for a donkey with a cord around her neck . There will be a young one with her . Turn them loose and bring them to me .
» Tell anyone who asks , ‘ The Lord needs them , ’ ’ and right away he will allow them to go . «
This took place so that the words of the prophet might come true :
» Say to the daughter of Zion , ‘ See , your King comes to you , humble , and seated on a donkey , a colt , the offspring of a beast of burden . ’ «
So the disciples did as Jesus commanded .
They got the donkey and the young one , and laid their clothing on them . And he sat on the clothing .
Most of the people spread their garments on the road . Others took branches from the trees and put them on the road .
Those going ahead of him and following him shouted praise : » Glory to the Son of David ! Blessed is he who comes in the name of Jehovah ! Glory in the highest ! «
When he came to Jerusalem , the people were excited . They asked : » Who is this ? «
Other people said : » This is the prophet Jesus , from Nazareth of Galilee . «
Jesus went into the Temple and drove out all who were trading there . He overturned the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those trading in doves .
He told them : » It is written , ‘ My house is to be named a house of prayer , ’ ’ but you are making it a hiding place of thieves . «
The blind and the crippled came to him in the Temple , and he made them well .
The chief priests and the scribes saw the powerful works he did . They heard the children crying out in the Temple : » Glory to the son of David . « This made them very angry .
» Have you any idea what these people are saying ? « Jesus answered : » Yes . It is written , ‘ From the lips of children and babies at the breast you have made your praise complete . ’ «
He left them and went out of the town to Bethany where he stayed for the night .
He was hungry in the morning when he returned to the town .
He saw a fig tree along the side of the road . He went to it and saw nothing on it but leaves . He told it : » You will not bare fruit from this time forward , forever . « Immediately the fig tree became dry and dead .
The disciples were surprised when they saw it . They asked how the fig tree became dry so quickly ?
Jesus answered : » If you have faith and do not doubt , I make this promise to you : You will be able to do what was done to this fig tree . When you say to this mountain , be moved into the sea , it will be done .
» You will receive the things you ask for in prayer when you have faith . «
When he went into the Temple , the chief priests and those in authority over the people came to him while he was teaching . They asked : » By what authority do you do these things ? Who gave you this authority ? «
Jesus answered : » I will ask you one question . If you give me the answer , I will say by what authority I do these things .
» Where did the baptism of John come from ? Was it from heaven or from men ? « They talked among themselves . » If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ ’ he will say , ‘ Why did you not have faith in him ? ’
» But if we say , ‘ From men , ’ ’ we must fear the people , because they all recognize John to be a prophet . «
Therefore they answered : » We have no idea . « He replied to them : » Then I will not tell you by what authority I do these things . «
» What do you think ? A man had two sons . He asked the first to work today in the vineyard .
» The first son said in answer , ‘ I will not . ’ ’ Later he changed his mind and went to work .
» He said the same to the second son . That son answered , ‘ Yes , I will go , ’ ’ but he did not go to work .
» Which of the two pleased his father ? « They replied : » The first . « Jesus said to them : » I tell you , tax collectors and prostitutes will go into the kingdom of God before you . «
» John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him . Even the tax collectors and prostitutes believed him . When you saw this , you did not regret your sins and did not have faith in him .
» Listen to another illustration . A master of a house made a vineyard , and put a wall around it . He made a wine press and built a tower . Then he rented it to workers and traveled to another country .
» When the time for the fruit came near , he sent his servants to the workmen , to get the fruit .
» The workmen attacked his servants , striking one with a stone and killing the other .
» He sent other servants more in number than the first . They did the same to them .
» Finally he sent his son to them , saying , ‘ Certainly they will respect my son . ’
» When the workmen saw the son , they said , ‘ Let us put him to death and take his heritage , for someday he will own this property . ’
» They took him out of the vineyard and killed him .
» When the lord of the vineyard returns , what will he do to the workmen ? «
They all said : » He will put those cruel men to death . Then he will find other workmen who are worthy and who will give him fruit when it is ready . «
Jesus said to them : » Have you read the Scriptures , ‘ The stone the builders rejected has been made the chief cornerstone of the building . This was Jehovah’s doing , and it is wonderful in our eyes . ’
» For this reason I tell you , The kingdom of God will be taken away from you . It will be given to a nation producing fruit .
» Any man falling on this stone will be broken . Any man having this stone fall on him will be crushed to dust . «
When the chief priests and Pharisees heard his illustrations they realized he was talking about them .
They wanted to seize him , but feared the people , because the people saw Jesus as a prophet .
Jesus continued to speak to them with illustrations .
» The kingdom of heaven is like a king who gave a wedding feast for his son .
» He sent out his servants to invite guests to the feast , but they would not come .
» Again he sent out other servants with orders to say to the guests , ‘ I have prepared my feast . Oxen and fat livestock are butchered and everything is ready , so come to the feast . ’
» But they paid no attention and went about their business . One went to his farm and another went to his trade .
» The rest violently attacked his servants and put them to death .
» The king was angry , and sent his armies to put the evil servants to death and to destroy their town with fire .
» He said to his servants , ‘ The feast is ready , but the guests were not worthy .
» ‘ Go then , to the main roads , and invite all those whom you see to come to the feast . ’
» They went to the roads and brought in everyone they could find , good and bad alike . And the banquet room was filled with guests .
» When the king met the guests he found that one of them was not wearing the right kind of clothes for the wedding .
» The king asked why did he not wear proper clothes for the wedding ? But the guest had no excuse .
» The king gave orders for that person to be tied hand and foot and thrown outside into the dark . That is where people will cry and grind their teeth in pain .
» Many are called , but few chosen . «
The Pharisees took counsel how they might trap him in his talk .
They sent their disciples with the Herodians to Jesus . They said : » Teacher we know you are truthful . You teach the way of God in truth . And you are not partial to the influence of men .
» Tell us what you think ? Is it lawful to pay the poll tax to Caesar , or not ? «
Jesus perceived their wickedness . He said : » Why do you test me , you hypocrites ?
» Show me the tribute money . « They brought a penny denarius to him .
He asked : » Whose image and superscription is on this coin ? «
» Caesar’s , « they said . Then he said : » Pay Caesar the things that are Caesar’s . Pay God the things that are God’s . «
When they heard it , they were amazed and left him .
That same day , Sadducees came to him . They believe there is no resurrection . They asked him a question .
» Teacher , Moses said if a man dies having no children , his brother should marry his wife , and bring up seed for his brother .
» There were seven brothers . The first married and died , and having no children , left his wife to his brother .
» The same happened to the second , right on through the seventh .
» After that the woman died .
» In the resurrection , with which of the seven will she be married ? All seven had her . «
Jesus answered : » You are mistaken ! You do not know the scriptures or the power of God .
» In the resurrection they will not marry nor be given in marriage . They will be like the angels in heaven .
» Concerning the resurrection of the dead , have you read that which was spoken to you by God ?
» God said : ‘ I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . ’ ’ God is not the God of the dead , but of the living ! «
When many people heard it , they were astonished at his teaching .
The Pharisees assembled together when they heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence .
One of them , a lawyer , tested him by asking a question .
» Teacher what is the greatest commandment in the law ? «
Jesus told him : » You shall love Jehovah your God with all your heart Greek : kardia : feelings , emotions , and with all your being , and with your entire mind Greek : dianoia : understanding .
» This is the greatest and first commandment .
» The second like it is this : ‘ You shall love your neighbor as yourself . ’
» The law and the prophets are based on these two commandments . «
The Pharisees were gathered together , so Jesus asked them a question .
» What do you think of the Christ ? Whose son is he ? « They said : » The son of David . «
He said : » How then does David , directed by Spirit , call him Lord , saying ,
» ‘ Jehovah said to my Lord , » Sit on my right hand until I put your enemies beneath your feet . « ’
» If David called him ‘ Lord , ’ ’ how is he his son ? «
No one was able to answer him . After that they asked no more questions .
Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples .
» The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat , « he said .
» Obey everything they teach you , but do not follow their example . They say one thing and do something else .
» They chain heavy burdens on your shoulders . Yet they are unwilling to lift even a finger to carry these same burdens .
» They do everything to be seen by men . For example : they enlarge their scripture cases for their foreheads and lengthen the tassels on their garments .
» They love the place of honor at banquets and the prominent seats in the synagogues .
» They require recognition in public places and insist on being called Rabbi by men .
» Do not be called Rabbi master teacher leader , for only one is your teacher . You are all brothers .
» Call no man your father on the earth , for only one is your Father in heaven .
» Do not be called master teacher leader , for only one is your master , and he is Christ .
» The greatest among you will be your servant .
» He who exalts himself will be humbled . He who humbles himself will be exalted .
» Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! You close the kingdom of heaven to people . You do not invite others to enter nor do you enter .
» Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! You travel on both sea and land to make one convert . When this happens , you make him twice as deserving of destruction in the trash fires of the valley of Hinnom Greek : Gehenna .
» Woe to you , you blind guides ! You say , ‘ When you swear by the temple , it is nothing . ’ ’ Then you say , ‘ When you swear by the gold of the temple , you are obligated . ’
» You fools ! You blind men ! Which is greater , the gold or the temple that sanctified the gold ?
» ‘ When you swear by an altar , you owe nothing . When you swear by the gift left on the altar , you are obligated .
» You blind men ! What is more important , the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift ?
» He who swears by the altar , swears by it and everything on it .
» He who swears by the temple , swears by it and by him that dwells within it .
» Thus , he who swears by heaven also swears by the throne of God and him who sits on it .
» Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! You tithe mint and dill and cumin , and have left undone the weightier matters of the law : justice , mercy and faith . You should do both and leave nothing undone .
» You blind guides ! You strain out the gnat and swallow the camel !
» Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! You cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter , yet the inside is full of extortion and excess .
» You are blind . Clean the inside of the cup and platter first . Then clean the outside .
» Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! You are like whitewashed tombs that appear beautiful on the outside . They are full of dead men’s bones and uncleanness on the inside .
» You appear righteous to men . However , inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness .
» Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! You build the tombs for the prophets and decorate the tombs of the righteous .
» You claim that you would not have been involved with your fathers when they spilled the blood of the prophets .
» You witness against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets .
» Fill up the guilt measure of your fathers .
» You serpents ! You offspring of vipers ! How will you escape from being destroyed in the ever-burning fires of the Valley of Hinnom ? Greek : Gehenna , the trash fires in the valley just outside of Jerusalem
» Look ! I am sending you prophets , wise men , and scribes . Some of them you will torture and kill . Others you will torment and persecute from city to city .
» You are responsible for all the righteous blood shed on earth . That includes the blood of the righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah , whom you killed between the sanctuary and the altar .
» I tell you , all these things will come upon this generation those living at that time .
» Jerusalem , Jerusalem , you kill the prophets and stone the messengers who are sent to you ! How often I wanted to gather your children together , even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings . But you were not willing !
» Behold , your house is left desolate .
» I tell you , you will not see me until you say , ‘ Blessed is he that comes in the name of Jehovah . ’ «
After Jesus left the temple , his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple .
He said to them : » Do you see these things ? I tell you , not one stone will be left upon another . They will all be thrown down . «
He sat on the Mount of Olives . The disciples came to him privately , saying : » Tell us when these things will be ? What will be the sign of your presence and of the end of the age ? «
Jesus answered : » Be careful that no man misleads you .
» Many will come in my name , saying , ‘ I am the Christ , ’ ’ and will deceive many .
» You will hear of wars and rumors of wars . Do not be troubled , for this must happen , but the end is not yet .
» Nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom . There will be famines and earthquakes in many places .
» These things are the beginning of birth pains Greek : odin' : in the throws of pain , such as childbirth .
» People will cause you tribulation , and kill you . You will be hated by all the nations for my name’s sake .
» Many will stumble and betray and hate one another .
» Many false prophets will arise and lead many astray .
» Wickedness and lawlessness will increase . The love of many will grow cold .
» The person who endures to the end will be saved .
» The good news of the kingdom will be preached in the entire world for a witness to all the nations and then the end will come .
» When you see the disgusting abomination of desolation unclean thing spoken about through Daniel the prophet , standing in the holy place let him that reads understand ,
» you in Judea flee to the mountains ;
» you on the housetop do not go down to remove the things in your house .
» You in the field do not return to get your clothes .
» You who are pregnant or nursing babies in those days will feel trouble .
» Pray that your flight not be in the winter , neither on a Sabbath .
» There will be great tribulation . It will be greater than any has ever been from the beginning of the world until now .
» Unless those days are shortened , no flesh will be saved . For the sake of the chosen ones selected individuals , those days will be shortened .
» If someone says , ‘ Here is the Christ , ’ ’ or , ‘ Over there is the Christ , ’ ’ do not believe it .
» There will be false Christs and false prophets . They will show great signs and wonders so that many will be misled . This includes some of the chosen ones .
» Remember , I told you before it happens .
» If they say , ‘ Look , he is in the wilderness , ’ ’ or , ‘ He is in the inner chambers , ’ ’ do not believe it .
» Lightning comes from the east and is seen in the west . The coming of the Son of man is like this .
» The eagles will gather at the place of the carcass .
» Immediately after the tribulation of those days , the sun will be darkened . The moon will not give light . The stars will fall from heaven . The powers of the heavens will be shaken .
» The sign of the Son of man will appear in heaven , and all the tribes of earth will mourn . They will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory .
» He will send his angels with a great trumpet sound . They will gather together the anointed from the four winds , from one end of the sky horizon to the other .
» Learn from the illustration of the fig tree . When the branch becomes tender and sprouts leaves , you know that summer is near .
» Therefore , when you see all these things , you will know he is near , even at the door .
» Truly I tell you , this generation those living at that time will not pass away till all these things take place .
» Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will not pass away .
» No one knows the day and the hour the period of time . The angels of heaven do not know . The Son does not know . Only the Father knows !
» The presence of the Son of man will be similar to the days of Noah .
» It will be like those days before the Flood . They were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that Noah entered into the ark .
» They were not aware until the Flood came and took them all away . The coming presence of the Son of man will be like this .
» Two will be in the field . One will be taken , and one will be left .
» Two will grind at the mill . One will be taken , and one will be left .
» Be alert , for you do not know what day the Lord will come .
» Know this , if the master of the house had known what time the thief was coming , he would have watched and his house would not have been vandalized .
» Be prepared ! The Son of man will come at a time when you do not expect it .
» Who then is the faithful , thoughtful , and wise servant , whom his lord put in charge of his other servants , to give them their food at the proper time ?
» That servant is blessed when his lord comes and finds him doing his will .
» I tell you , he will put him in charge of everything he owns .
» But if that evil servant says in his heart , ‘ My lord delays ,
» so I will beat mistreat my fellow servants . ’ ’ And he eats and drinks with drunkards ,
» the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect it , an hour when he is unaware .
» He will punish him severely , and send him to be with the hypocrites . There they will cry and grind their teeth .
» The kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom .
» Five of them were foolish , and five were wise .
» The foolish took no oil with their lamps .
» The wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps .
» They all slept , because the bridegroom delayed his arrival .
» There was a shout at midnight . ‘ Here is the bridegroom ! Come meet him . ’
» The virgins awoke and trimmed their lamps .
» All the foolish virgins said to the wise : ‘ Give us your oil , for our lamps are going out . ’
» But the wise answered : ‘ There will not be enough for both of us . Go to the dealers and buy oil for yourself . ’
» While they were away , the bridegroom came . They that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast and the door was shut .
» Later the other virgins came , saying : ‘ Lord , Lord , open to us . ’
» But he told them : ‘ I do not know you . ’
» Watch therefore , for you do not know the day or the hour .
» It is like a man going to another country . He called his servants and put them in charge of his property .
» To one he gave five talents , to another two , to another one . He assigned according to the servants’ ability . Then he went on his journey .
» Right away the servant who received the five talents traded with them and made another five talents .
» In like manner , he who received the two gained another two .
» He who received the one dug a hole in the ground and hid his lord’s money .
» After a long time the lord of those servants came back to settle with them .
» The servant who received five talents brought another five talents . He said : ‘ Lord , here are your five talents , plus the five I gained . ’
» His lord said : ‘ Well done , good and faithful servant . You have been faithful over a few things , so I will put you in charge of many things . Enter into the joy of your lord . ’
» The one who received two talents said : ‘ Lord you gave me two talents and I gained another two talents . ’
» His lord said : ‘ Well done , good and faithful servant . You were faithful over a few things . I will appoint you over many things . Enter into the joy of your lord . ’
» The servant who received one talent said : ‘ Lord , I knew you to be a hard man . You reap where you did not sow and gather where you did not scatter .
» ‘ I was afraid , so I hid your talent in the earth . See , you have what is yours . ’
» But his lord answered : ‘ You wicked and lazy servant . You knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not scatter .
» ‘ You should have put my money in the bank . I should have received my money back plus interest .
» ‘ Take the talent from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents .
» ‘ More will be given to every one who has and he will have abundance . He who does not have will have every thing taken away .
» ‘ Throw the worthless servant into outer darkness . There will be crying and grinding of teeth . ’
» When the Son of man comes in his glory , and all the angels with him , he will sit on his glorious throne .
» All nations will be gathered before him . He will then separate them one from another , as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats .
» He will set the sheep on his right hand , but the goats on the left .
» The King will say to those on his right hand : ‘ Come , you blessed of my Father , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world .
» ‘ I was hungry and you gave me something to eat . I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink . I was a stranger and you took me in .
» ‘ I was naked and you clothed me . I was sick and you visited me . I was in prison and you came to me . ’
» The righteous will answer him : ‘ Lord , when did we see you hungry and feed you , or thirsty and give you drink ?
» ‘ When did we see you as a stranger and take you in , or naked and dress you ?
» ‘ When did we see you sick or in prison and come to you ? ’
» The King will answer : ‘ To the extent that you did it to one of the least of my brothers , you did it to me . ’
» Then he will tell those on his left : ‘ Depart from me , you cursed , into the ever-burning fire that is prepared for the Devil and his fallen angels .
» ‘ I was hungry and you did not feed me . I was thirsty and you did not give me drink .
» ‘ I was a stranger and you did not take me in . I was naked and you did not dress me . I was sick and in prison and you did not visit me . ’
» They will also ask : ‘ Lord , when did we see you hungry or thirsty , a stranger or naked , sick or in prison and not minister to you ? ’
» The King will answer : ‘ To the extent that you did not do it to one of the least of my brothers , you did not do it to me . ’
» These will go away into ever-burning fire everlasting cutting off death total destruction doom punishment everlasting penalty , but the righteous to everlasting life . ’ «
When Jesus had finished talking , he said to his disciples :
» As you know , the Passover will be here in two days . At that time the Son of man will be captured and impaled . «
The chief priest and the elders of the people assembled at the court of Caiaphas , the high priest .
All of them , using deceit , worked together to capture Jesus and kill him .
They insisted : » Not during the feast ; it could start a riot among the people . «
Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper .
A woman came to him having an alabaster vase containing very precious ointment . She poured it upon his head while he was eating .
The disciples saw it and were indignant . » To what purpose is this waste ?
» This ointment could have been sold for much and the money given to the poor . «
Jesus was aware of this and said : » Why do you trouble the woman ? Her expression to me was good .
» The poor are always with you , but I am not always with you .
» She poured this ointment on my body to prepare me for burial .
» I tell you , Everywhere this good news is preached in the entire world , this good deed done by this woman will be spoken of in memory of her . «
Then Judas Iscariot , one of the twelve , went to the chief priests .
He asked them : » What are you willing to give me to deliver him to you ? « They paid him thirty pieces of silver .
He continued to seek opportunity to turn him over to them .
The first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus . They asked : » Where do you wish to eat the Passover ? «
Jesus told them to go into the city and tell a certain man : » The Teacher’s time is at hand . I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples . «
The disciples did as Jesus told them , to get ready for the Passover .
When evening arrived , he sat down to eat with the twelve disciples .
While they ate , he said : » One of you will betray me . «
They were filled with sorrow , and each one asked him : » Is it I , Lord ? «
He answered : » He who dips his hand with me in the dish is the same one who will betray me .
» It is written that the Son of man will depart . The man who betrays him will experience much grief . It would have been better if that man had not been born . «
Judas , the man who betrayed him , asked : » Is it I , Rabbi ? « Jesus replied : » You said it . «
As they were eating , Jesus took bread , blessed , and broke it ; and he gave to the disciples . Then he said : » Take , eat ; this is represents means exemplifies my body . «
Then he took a cup and gave thanks , and gave it to them , saying : » Drink it all . «
» This is represents means exemplifies my blood of the covenant , poured out for many for forgiveness of sins .
» I tell you , I shall not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom . «
After they sang a song of praise to God , they went to the Mount of Olives .
Jesus said to them : » All of you will fall away because of me tonight . It is written , ‘ I will strike the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock will be scattered . ’
» When I am raised , I will go ahead of you to Galilee . «
Peter answered : » Even if everyone falls away because of you , I will never fall away . «
Jesus said : » I say to you , this very night , before a rooster crows , you will deny me three times . «
Peter protested : » Even if I must die for you , I would not deny you ! « His disciples said the same thing .
Jesus went with them to Gethsemane . He said to his disciples : » Sit here while I go over there and pray . «
He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him . He was sorrowful and very troubled .
He told them : » My heart is deeply grieved to the point of death . Stay with me and watch . «
Then he went forward a little , and fell on his face , and prayed : » My Father , if it is possible , let this cup pass away from me : nevertheless , not as I will , but as you will . «
When he came to the disciples , they were sleeping . He said to Peter : » Could you not watch with me one hour ?
» Watch and pray continually that you do not enter into temptation ! «
A second time he went away and prayed , saying : » Father , if this cannot pass away , except I drink it , your will be done . «
He returned to find them sleeping again , for their eyes were heavy .
He went away to pray a third time , saying the same words .
After returning to the disciples , he said : » Do you sleep now and take your rest ? The hour is here and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
» Arise , let us go ; the man who betrays me is here . «
As he spoke , Judas , one of the twelve , followed by a crowd carrying swords and spears , approached him . The chief priest and elders of the people had sent them .
He that betrayed him gave them a sign . He told them : » The one I kiss is he . Take him . «
He went directly to Jesus and said : » Hail , Rabbi , « and kissed him .
Jesus told him : » Do that for which you came . « They laid hands on Jesus , and captured him .
Look , one of them with Jesus stretched out his hand , drew his sword , and cut off the ear of the servant of the high priest .
Jesus told him : » Put your sword in its place . Those who take up the sword will perish by the sword .
» Do you think I cannot ask my Father for help ? He would send me more than twelve legions of angels .
» How then will the scriptures be fulfilled , that it must happen this way ? «
That very hour Jesus said to the people , » Have you come out to take me with swords and sticks as if I were a thief ? You did not take me when I taught in the Temple daily .
» This has taken place so that the writings of the prophets will come true . « Then all his disciples left him .
Those who captured Jesus took him to the house of Caiaphas , the high priest . The scribes and those in authority also gathered there .
But Peter kept his distance . He followed him to the courtyard of the high priest . He entered and sat down with the servants , to see the outcome .
The chief priests and all the Sanhedrin were looking for false witness against Jesus . They wanted to put him to death .
They failed , even though a number of false witnesses came .
Later two witnesses came . They said : » This man said , ‘ I am able to destroy the Temple of God and to rebuild it in three days . ’ «
The high priest stood up and said to him : » Have you no answer ? What is it these say against you ? «
Jesus said nothing . The high priest said to him : » I put you on oath , by the living God , that you will tell us if you are the Christ , the Son of God . «
Jesus said to him : » You said it yourself . And I say to you , after this you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven . «
Then the high priest ripped his robes apart and said : » He has said evil against God ! Why do we need more witnesses ? You have heard his words of blasphemy ! «
» What is your opinion ? « The crowd answered : » Put him to death ! «
They spat in his face and hit him , saying :
» Prophesy to us , you Christ ; tell us who hit you ! «
Peter was seated in the square outside the house , and a servant-girl came to him . She said : » You were with Jesus the Galilean . «
In front of everybody , he replied : » I do not know what you are talking about . «
When he reached the gate , another saw him and said : » This man was with Jesus the Nazarene . «
Again he denied with an oath : » I have no knowledge of the man . «
A few moments later , those who were near approached and said to Peter : » Indeed , you are one of them , because the way you speak gives you away . «
Then with curses and oaths he said : » I do not know the man ! « And immediately a rooster crowed .
Peter remembered what Jesus told him : » Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times . « He went out and wept bitterly .
It was morning . The chief priests and those in authority conspired to put Jesus to death .
They tied his hands with cords and led him to the ruler , Pilate .
Judas , his betrayer , heard he was to be put to death . Out of regret , he took the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and those in authority .
He said : » I have done wrong in giving a righteous man to you . «
He left the silver in the Temple . Then he went away and hanged himself .
The chief priests took the silver . They said : » It is not right to put it in the Temple treasury , for it is the price of blood . «
They decided to use the silver to buy the potter’s field . This would be a place to bury strangers .
This is the reason the field was named » Field of Blood . «
Then Jeremiah’s prophecy was fulfilled : » They took the thirty pieces of silver , the price he was valued by the children of Israel .
» Then they paid for the potter’s field , just as God directed . «
Jesus stood before the governor . He asked him : » Are you the King of the Jews ? « Jesus said to him : » It is as you say . «
When the chief priests and those in authority made statements against him , he gave no answer .
Pilate said to him : » Do you give no attention to what their witnesses say against you ? «
Jesus did not answer . Not even a word ! The governor was greatly surprised .
It was a custom for the governor to set one prisoner free at the time of the feast . The people were to help choose that prisoner .
At that time they held an important prisoner named Barabbas .
When they assembled , Pilate asked : » What is your choice ? Barabbas or Jesus , the one called the Christ ? «
He knew it was because of envy they gave him up .
While he was seated in judgment his wife sent a message to him . She said , » Do not judge that righteous man . I have had much trouble this day in a dream because of him . «
The chief priests and elders got the people to request Barabbas , and for Jesus to be put to death .
The governor responded to them . He asked : » Which of the two do you want me to set free ? « They shouted : » Barabbas ! «
Pilate said to them : » What am I to do with Jesus , the one called Christ ? « They all said : » Put him to death . Impale him ! «
» What evil has he done ? « Pilate asked . But they shouted : » Impale him ! «
Pilate saw that he could do nothing . The people were ready to cause much trouble . He took water and washed his hands in front of the people . He said : » The blood of this man is not on my hands . You are responsible . «
The people answered : » Let his blood be on us , and on our children . «
He set Barabbas free . He had Jesus whipped . Then he commanded that he be put to death on the stake .
Then the palace guard took Jesus into the open square and gathered their squad together .
They took off his clothes and dressed him in a scarlet robe .
They made a crown of thorns and put it on his head . They placed a rod in his right hand . Then they bowed down on their knees before him . They mocked him , saying : » Long life to the King of the Jews . «
They spat on him and hit him on the head with the rod .
After they mocked him , they took off the robe . He was dressed in his garments and he was led away to be impaled .
They then found Simon , a man from Cyrene . They forced him to go with them to carry the stake .
Golgotha , the Place of the Skull , was to be his final destination .
They gave him vinegar bitter wine to drink mixed with poison a drug gall . When he tasted it he would not drink .
When they impaled him , they divided his garments among themselves by casting lots .
Then they sat and watched him .
A sign was placed above his head with an accusation written : » This is Jesus the King of the Jews . «
Two robbers were impaled with him . One was on the right hand and one on the left .
People passing by spoke evil abuse to him . They wagged their heads
and said , » You who would destroy the Temple and rebuild it in three days , save yourself . If you are the Son of God come down from the stake . «
In like manner the chief priests , scribes , and elders mocked him .
They said : » He saved others , but cannot save himself . He is the King of Israel ; let him now come down from the stake and we will believe in him . «
He trusts in God . Let him save him now if he wants him . After all he said : » I am the Son of God . «
The robbers that were impaled with him also insulted him .
Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour .
About the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , » Eli , Eli , lama sabachthani ? « Which translated means : » My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? «
After hearing it some said this man calls Elijah .
Suddenly , one of them ran , took a sponge , filled it with vinegar , put it on a reed , and gave it to him to drink .
The rest said : » Let it be , and see whether Elijah comes to save him . «
Jesus cried again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit .
The veil curtain of the temple was ripped in two from the top to the bottom . The earth quaked and the rocks split .
The tombs were split open and many dead bodies were tossed upright on the ground .
[ They came out of the tombs after his resurrection . ] Many people saw them .
The centurion and those who were with him watching Jesus saw the earthquake . Filled with much fear of the things that were done , they proclaimed : » Truly , this was the Son of God ! «
The women who followed Jesus from Galilee and ministered to him watched from a distance .
Included among the women were Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James and Joses , and the mother of the sons of Zebedee .
A disciple of Jesus named Joseph , a rich man from Arimathea ,
went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus . Pilate commanded that it be given to him .
Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth .
He laid it in his own new tomb , which he had cut out of the rock . Then he rolled a great stone in front of the door of the tomb , and departed .
Mary Magdalene was near the tomb . The other Mary was also there .
It was morning , the day after Preparation . The chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together with Pilate .
They said : » Sir , we remember while he was yet alive , the deceiver said , ‘ After three days I will rise again . ’ «
» Command the tomb be secured until the third day . Otherwise his disciples could come and steal him away . They could say to the people . ‘ He is risen from the dead . ’ ’ The last deception will be worse than the first . «
Pilate said to them : » You have a guard ; make it as secure as you can . «
So they made the tomb secure . They sealed the stone and placed a guard there .
Now after the Sabbath , as the first day of the week began , Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb .
Suddenly there was a great earthquake , as an angel of God descended from heaven and rolled away the stone and sat on it .
His appearance was as lightning , and his clothing white as snow .
The guards shook with fear and became as dead men .
The angel spoke to the women : » I know you seek Jesus who has been impaled ; do not fear .
» He is not here , for he has risen just as he promised . Come ; see the place where the Lord lay .
» Go quickly and tell his disciples he has risen from the dead . See , he goes before you to Galilee . You will see him there , as I have told you . «
They departed quickly from the tomb , with fear and great joy . They ran to bring his disciples the news .
Jesus met them and greeted them . They approached and took hold of his feet and kissed them in adoration .
Then Jesus told them : » Do not fear . Go tell my brothers to travel to Galilee . I will see them there . «
While they were going , some of the guard came into the city . They told the chief priests all the things that happened .
They took counsel with the elders . Then they bribed the soldiers .
The soldiers were instructed to say : » His disciples came at night and stole him while we slept . «
» If the governor hears about this , we will persuade him so you may be free from worry . «
So they took the money and did as they were told . This saying was spread abroad among the Jews , and continues until this day .
The eleven disciples went into Galilee to the mountain where Jesus specified .
When they saw him , they bowed down in adoration for him . But some doubted were lacking faith .
Jesus came to them and spoke to them , saying : » All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth .
» Go and make disciples of all the nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit .
» Teach them to observe all the things I have commanded you . Behold , I am with you always , even to the end of the age . «
The beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ , the Son of God .
The prophet Isaiah wrote : » I am sending my messenger ahead of you to prepare your way . «
» The voice of one crying in the wilderness , prepare the way of Jehovah , make his paths straight . «
John the Baptist was in the desert wilderness telling people to repent turn away from sin and be baptized for forgiveness of sins .
People from the province of Judea and the city of Jerusalem went out to hear John . They confessed their sins and he baptized them in the Jordan River .
John was clothed in camel’s hair with a leather belt about his loins . He ate locusts and wild honey .
He told the people : » The man who comes after me is greater than I am . I am not worthy to stoop down and untie his shoes .
» I baptized immersed you with water , but he will baptize Greek : baptizo : immerse , submerge you with Holy Spirit . «
Soon Jesus came from Nazareth in the province of Galilee . John baptized Jesus in the Jordan River .
When Jesus came out of the water he saw the heavens open and the Spirit descended on him like a dove .
Then a voice came from heaven : « You are my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased . «
At once the Spirit compelled Jesus to go into the wilderness filled with wild animals .
Satan tempted Jesus . This lasted forty days . The angels took care of Jesus .
After John was locked in prison Jesus went to Galilee and preached the Good News of God to the people .
Jesus said : » The time has come . The kingdom of God is at hand . Repent and believe the good news . «
Walking by the Sea of Galilee he saw two fishermen Simon and Andrew , Simon’s brother . They were casting a net into the sea .
Jesus said : Follow me and I will teach you to catch people .
They immediately left the nets and went with him .
Jesus then saw James and John , the sons of Zebedee . They were in a boat preparing their nets to go fishing .
Jesus called them and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and went with Jesus .
Jesus and his followers traveled to Capernaum . On the day of worship Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach .
They were astonished at his doctrine , for he taught with authority and not like the scribes .
Suddenly in the synagogue there was a man with an unclean spirit . He screamed :
» What do you want with us Jesus of Nazareth ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are . You are the Holy One of God ! «
Jesus rebuked the spirit by saying : » Be quiet , and come out of him ! «
The evil spirit shook the man hard , gave a loud scream , and came out of him .
The people were all amazed and questioned . » What is this ? What new doctrine is this ? He has authority over the unclean spirits , and they obey him . «
His fame spread to the entire country of Galilee .
Jesus and his disciples , including James and John , left the synagogue and went directly to the home of Simon and Andrew .
Simon’s mother-in-law was in bed with a fever . At once they told Jesus about her .
He took her by the hand and helped her sit up . The fever suddenly left . So she got up and prepared a meal for them .
That evening at sunset many sick and demon-possessed people were presented to Jesus .
A huge crowd of people from all over Capernaum gathered outside to watch .
Jesus healed many who were sick with various diseases . He cast out many demons . Knowing them he would not permit the demons to speak .
Early in the morning , long before daybreak , Jesus awoke and went into the wilderness to pray .
Later Simon and the others went out to find him .
They informed him : » Everyone is asking for you . «
He replied : » We must go to other towns . I will preach to them too . I came for this purpose . «
He went to Synagogues in every part of Galilee , preaching and driving out evil spirits .
A man with leprosy knelt in front of Jesus and begged to be healed . » If you want to , you can make me well , « he said .
Moved with compassion Jesus touched him . » I want to , « he said . » Be healed ! «
Instantly the leprosy disappeared and man was healed .
Jesus sent him away and warned him . » Go directly to the priest and let him examine you .
» Do not talk to anyone along the way . Take the offering the Law of Moses requires for those healed of leprosy . That way everyone will have proof of your healing . «
But the man gave a public account of his healing everywhere he went . Soon crowds surrounded Jesus and he could not enter a town publicly . He had to stay in secluded places and people continued to come to him .
Several days later Jesus returned to Capernaum . The word spread that he was home .
So many people gathered that there was no room left even by the door . Jesus was speaking God’s word to them .
Men came to him carrying a paralyzed man .
They could not bring him to Jesus because of the crowd . So they removed the roof over the place where Jesus was . Then they lowered the cot on which the paralyzed man was lying .
When Jesus saw their faith , he told the man : » Friend your sins are forgiven . «
Some of the scribes sitting there reasoned in their hearts :
» Why does this man speak this way ? He blasphemes for only God is the one who can forgive sins . «
Jesus immediately discerned in his spirit that they reasoned within themselves . He asked them : » Why reason these things in your hearts ?
» Which is easier to say to the sick man your sins are forgiven or take your bed and walk ?
» So you may see that the Son of man has authority to forgive sins on earth , « he said to the man :
» Get up and take your bed , and go to your house . «
He got up , took the bed and went out before them all . They were all filled with wonder . They gave glory to God and said we have never seen anything like this .
Again he went to the seaside and all the people followed him . So he taught them .
He saw Levi , the son of Alphaeus , seated at the place where taxes were collected . He said to him : » Come with me . « And he got up and went with him .
He was reclining at the meal in his house . Several tax collectors and sinners were at the table with Jesus and his disciples . There were a great number of them , and they came after him .
When the scribes of the Pharisees saw he was eating with the tax collectors and sinners they asked his disciples : » Why does he take food and drink with such men ? «
Jesus heard this . He said to them : » Those who are well have no need of a medical man but those who are ill do . I have come to care for sinners not the upright . «
John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting . They came to him and asked : » Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast but your disciples do not ? «
Jesus replied : » Will the friends of a newly married man practice fasting while he is with them ? As long as they have him with them they will not go without food .
» But the days will come when the husband will be taken away from them . Then they will fast .
» No man puts a patch of new cloth on an old coat . The new , by pulling away from the old , makes a worse hole .
» No man puts new wine into old wineskins . The skins will burst and the wine and the skins will be wasted . New wine has to be put into new wine skins . «
Jesus went through the grain fields on the Sabbath day . While they walked his disciples took the heads of grain .
The Pharisees said : » Why are they doing what it is not right to do on the Sabbath ? «
He said : » Do you not know of what David did when he needed food for himself and his companions ?
» He went into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest . David took the holy bread for food and gave to his companions . Only the priests may take the holy bread .
» The Sabbath was made for man , said Jesus , and not man for the Sabbath .
» The Son of man is lord even of the Sabbath . «
He entered the Synagogue again . There was a man there whose hand was withered .
They watched to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath day . Then they might have something against him .
He said to the man : » Get up and come forward . «
Then he asked the Pharisees , » Is it right to do good on the Sabbath or to do evil ? Is it right to give life or to put to death ? « But they said nothing .
He looked at them and was angry . He was also sad on account of their hard hearts . He said to the man : » Stretch out your hand . « He stretched it out and his hand was healed .
The Pharisees went away and immediately conspired with the Herodians . They tried to decide how they might destroy him .
Jesus went with his disciples to the sea . A great crowed from Galilee followed . They were also from Judaea ,
Jerusalem , Idumaea , beyond the Jordan , and from Tyre and Sidon . These people heard the great things he did and came to him .
He asked his disciples to have a small boat ready because the crowd might press too close to him .
He healed many . Others with afflictions pressed close to him that they might touch him .
The unclean spirits fell down before him and cried : You are the Son of God .
He commanded them not to make him known .
He went up on the mountain and invited anyone who wanted to go with him .
He appointed twelve to be with him and he sent them out to preach .
He gave them authority to cast out demons .
The twelve included Simon whom he surnamed Peter ,
James the son of Zebedee , John the brother of James surnamed Boanerges , which is , Sons of thunder :
Andrew , Philip , Bartholomew , Matthew , Thomas , James the son of Alphaeus , Thaddaeus , Simon the Cananaean .
Also present was Judas Iscariot , who also betrayed him . Then he went into a house .
The crowd gathered so close that they did not have time for bread .
When his own people heard of this they went to apprehend him . They said : » He has lost his senses . «
Scribes that came down from Jerusalem said : » He has Beelzebub . He casts out demons by the prince of the demons . «
Jesus called them to him and spoke to them in illustrations . He asked : » How could Satan cast out Satan ?
» When a kingdom is divided against itself that kingdom cannot stand .
» When a house is divided against itself it will not be able to stand .
» If Satan has risen up against himself , he is divided , cannot stand and will come to an end .
» No one can enter into the house of the strong man and steal his property unless he first captures the strong man . Then he will steal his property .
» I tell you sins will be forgiven of the sons of men , and their evil talk will be forgiven .
» But whoever speaks evil and defames Holy Spirit will not be forgiven but is guilty of an eternal sin . «
They exclaimed : » He has an unclean spirit ! «
His mother and his brother were standing nearby . They sent for him .
A crowd was sitting around him . They said to him : » Look your mother and you brother are outside looking for you . «
He answered them : » Who is my mother and who is my brother ? «
Looking at the people who sat around him he said : » Behold , my mother and my brother !
» For whoever does the will of God , the same is my brother , and sister , and mother . «
Again he taught a very great crowd by the seaside . He sat in a boat while the crowd was on the land .
He taught them many things by illustrations and said to them :
» Listen , the sower went out to sow .
» As he sowed some seed fell by the road and the birds came and devoured it .
» Other seed fell on the rocky ground and did not have good soil . Immediately it sprang up , because it had no good soil
it became scorched when the sun came up . Then it withered because it had no root .
» Some seed fell among the thorns . The thorns grew up and choked it so it could yield no fruit .
» Others fell on good ground and yielded fruit . It grew up , increased and produced thirty fold , and sixty fold , and a hundred fold . «
He continued : » He who has ears to hear let him hear . «
When he was alone his followers including the twelve asked about the illustrations .
He told them : » The secret of the kingdom of God is given to you . Illustrations are spoken to outsiders .
» So that seeing they may see and not perceive . And hearing they may hear and not understand . Otherwise they might repent and be forgiven . «
Then he asked : » Do you not understand this illustration ? How will you understand any of the illustrations ?
» The sower sows the word .
» These are they by the wayside where the word is sown . When they have heard ; Satan comes and takes away the word that has been sown in them .
» The same is so of the word sown upon the rocky places . When they have heard the word and receive it with joy ,
they have no root in themselves , but endure for a while . They stumble when tribulation or persecution arise .
» There is the word sown among the thorns . These have heard the word ,
but the cares of the world , the deceitfulness of riches , and the lusts for other things enter in and choke the word . So it becomes unfruitful .
» Those who represent that sown upon the good soil hear the word and accept it . They bear fruit , thirty fold , and sixty fold , and a hundred fold . «
He asked them : » Is the lamp placed under a bushel , or under a bed , and not on the stand ?
» There is nothing hidden unless it should be made known . Nothing is made secret that should come to light .
» If any man has ears to hear , let him hear . «
Then he said : » Be careful what you listen to . That which is portioned out by you might be portioned to you and more .
» He who has , to him it will be given . He who has not , from him will be taken even that which he has . «
He added : » The kingdom of God is like this . A man plants seed in the earth .
» He sleeps and gets up night and day until the plants grow though he has no idea how .
» The earth gives fruit by itself . First comes the leaf , then the head , then full grain .
» When the grain is ready he immediately sends men to cut it , because the time for cutting has come . «
He said : » What illustration should we use to picture the kingdom of God ? What story will make it clear ?
» It is like a grain of mustard seed . When it is planted in the earth it is smaller than all the seeds on the earth .
» But when it is planted it grows and becomes taller than all the plants . It grows out great branches so that the birds of heaven are able to take rest in its shade . «
He spoke the word to them with many illustrations as long as they were able to listen .
He spoke only with illustrations . However he made all things clear to his disciples in private .
When evening arrived Jesus said : Let us go over to the other side . «
They took him with them on the boat and left the people . Other boats were with him also .
A great windstorm came up and the waves came into the boat .
He was in back of the boat sleeping on a cushion . They woke him . They said : » Master is it nothing to you that we are in danger of destruction ? «
He awoke from sleep and commanded the wind and sea . He commanded the sea to be at peace and rest . And he commanded the wind to go down and there was a great calm .
He said : » Why are you full of fear ? Do you have no faith ? «
Their fear was great . They said to themselves : » Who is this , that even the wind and the sea obey his orders ? «
They traveled to the other side of the sea , to the country of the Gerasenes .
Just as he got out of the boat a man with an unclean spirit came to him from the tombs .
He was living in the tombs . No man was able to bind him even with a chain .
Often he was bound in chains and iron bands but he would break them . No man was strong enough to keep him still .
Day and night in the tombs and in the mountains he cried out . He would cut himself with stones .
He saw Jesus from far off and quickly approached and bowed down before him .
Crying out with a loud voice , he said : » What have I to do with you , Jesus , Son of the highest God ? In God’s name do not torment me ! «
Jesus commanded : » Come out of the man you unclean spirit ! «
Then Jesus said : » What is your name ? « He answered : » My name is Legion because there are a great number of us . «
He earnestly implored him not to send the spirits away out of the country .
There was a large herd of pigs feeding on the mountainside .
They pleaded with Jesus : » Send us into the pigs ! «
He let them do it . Then the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs . The herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the sea . About two thousand of them died in the sea .
Their keepers ran off to the town to tell others what happened . People came to see what had taken place .
When they came to Jesus they saw the man who had been demon possessed . He was fully clothed and in full use of his senses . So they were afraid .
Those who saw the event gave a full account of what happened to the man , the evil spirits and the pigs .
They asked Jesus to leave their country .
Entering the boat , the man who had been possessed with demons asked that he might be allowed to travel with him .
Jesus told him : » Go to your house and to your friends and tell them about the great things God did for you and how he had mercy on you . «
He went away and told others in Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him . They all marveled .
Again Jesus crossed over in the boat to the other side . A great crowd gathered to him while he was by the sea .
Jairus , a ruler of the synagogue , saw Jesus and fell at his feet .
He pleaded with him saying : » My little daughter is at the point of death . Please come and lay your hands on her that she will be healed and live . «
Jesus went with him . A great crowd followed him and they pressed very close to him .
There was a woman who had an issue of blood twelve years .
She suffered treatment from many physicians but did not become better . She spent all her money and grew worse .
Hearing about Jesus she came though the crowd and touched his garment .
She said : » If I touch his garments I shall be made whole . «
Immediately the flow of her blood dried up . She felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction .
Suddenly Jesus recognized that power issued from him . He turned to the crowd and asked : » Who touched my garments ? «
His disciples said to him : » You see all these people around you and you ask who touched me ? «
He looked around to see the woman who had done this thing .
The woman was afraid and trembled . Knowing what happened she fell down before him , and told him the truth .
He said : » Daughter your faith has made you whole . Go in peace and be healed of your affliction . «
While he yet spoke they came from the ruler of the synagogue’s house . They said : » Your daughter is dead . Do not trouble the teacher . «
But Jesus did not listen . He said to the ruler of the synagogue believe and do not fear .
He allowed only Peter , James , and John the brother of James to follow him .
The house of the ruler of the synagogue was filled with commotion . Many were weeping and wailing .
He entered and said : » Why all the commotion and why do you weep . The child is not dead but sleeps . «
They laughed him to scorn . He sent them all out of the house . Then he took the father , mother and his companions and went to the child .
He took the child by the hand and said to her : » Talitha cumi . « Which means when interpreted , » little girl I say to you arise . «
Immediately the twelve-year old girl rose up and walked . And they were promptly amazed with a great amazement .
He gave them firm orders not to tell any man about this . Then he commanded that she be given something to eat .
He left there and went to his own country . His disciples followed him .
Jesus taught in the synagogue on the Sabbath . Many were astonished when they heard him . They asked : » Where did this man get these things ? What is the wisdom given to this man and how did he perform these mighty works by his hands ?
» Is this the carpenter , the son of Mary , brother of James , Joses , Judas , and Simon ? Are not his sisters here with us ? « He offended them .
Jesus said to them : » A prophet is not without honor except in his own country , among his own people and in his own house . «
He laid his hands upon a few sick and healed them . Otherwise he did no mighty work there .
He wondered at their unbelief . Then he went around to the villages teaching .
He summoned the twelve and sent them forth in pairs . They were given authority over the unclean spirits .
They were instructed to take nothing for their journey , with the exception of a walking staff .
They were to take no bread , no wallet , no money in their purse and no extra sandals or coat .
He said : » When someone invites you to enter into a house , stay there until you leave .
» When someone will not listen to you leave that house and shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony to the householder . «
They went out to preach that men should repent .
They cast out many demons . They anointed the sick with oil and healed them .
John the Baptist had become well known . King Herod heard that John had risen from the dead . Therefore he was doing these powerful works .
But others said : » It is Elijah . « And others said : » It is a prophet , like one of the prophets . «
Herod said : » It is John whom I beheaded , raised from the dead . «
For Herod captured John and locked him in prison for the sake of Herodias his wife . She was his brother Philip’s wife before he married her .
John said to Herod : » It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife . «
Herodias had a grudge against John and was determined to have him killed .
But Herod feared John . He knew he was a righteous and holy man so he kept him safe . That is why he listened to John but was perplexed .
It was Herod’s birthday . He invited his lords , the military commanders , and the prominent men of Galilee to supper .
When the daughter of Herodias danced for Herod and his guests , she pleased him so much he promised her anything she desired .
He pledged to her , » Whatever you ask of me , I will give it to you , up to half of my kingdom . «
She asked her mother , » What should I ask ? « And the mother said : » The head of John the Baptist . «
At once she went to the king and asked : » Will you give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter . «
The king was very sorry . Even so he kept his promise to her . He did not turn her down . This also showed his dinner guests he was a man of his word .
He immediately commanded his guard to behead John the Baptist and bring his head to him .
He brought his head on a platter and gave it to the young lady . In turn she gave it to her mother .
When his disciples heard this they took his corpse and laid it in a tomb .
The apostles gathered together with Jesus . They told him all things they had done and taught .
He told them come into a secluded place and rest a while . For there were many people coming and going and they had no leisure time .
They went away in the boat to a secluded place .
The people from all the cities knew they were going and they ran together on foot to arrive ahead of them .
When he arrived and saw the great crowd he had compassion on them . They were as sheep without a shepherd . He taught them many things .
Late in the day his disciples approached him . They said : » The day is almost over and we are in a secluded place .
» Send them away that they may go to the country and villages nearby and buy themselves something to eat . «
He replied : » You give them food to eat . « They asked : » Should we buy two hundred shillings’ worth of bread to feed them ? «
He said « » Find out how many loaves you have ? When they knew they said « » Five loaves and two fishes . «
He commanded them to sit down by groups upon the green grass .
They sat down in groups of hundreds , and fifties .
Then he looked up to heaven and blessed the food . He took the five loaves and the two fishes , and broke the loaves into pieces and gave them to his disciples . He also divided the two fishes . He gave the food to his disciples to serve to the people .
They all ate and were filled .
They collected twelve baskets full of broken pieces of bread and fishes .
Five thousand men ate .
Jesus made his disciples hurry into a boat to cross to Bethsaida ahead of him . Then he sent the crowd away .
After he left he went to the mountain to pray .
He was on the shore at the beginning of evening and the boat was in the midst of the sea .
He saw that they were tired of rowing for the wind was against them . It was the fourth watch of the night . He walked on the sea and was about to pass them .
When they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a spirit an illusion and screamed .
They all saw him and were troubled . Suddenly he spoke to them : » Be of good cheer . It is I do not fear . «
He entered the boat and the wind ceased . They were truly amazed .
They had not understood the loaves of bread . Their minds were closed .
They completed the crossing to the land of Gennesaret and anchored by the shore .
The people saw him as soon as they left the boat .
They were wherever he was in the whole region . They carried the sick on their beds to him .
When he entered a village or city in the marketplaces or the country the sick tried to touch the border of his garment and be healed .
The Pharisees and some of the scribes came from Jerusalem to gather around Jesus .
They saw that some of his disciples ate their bread with unwashed defiled hands .
( For the Pharisees , and all the Jews , do not eat until they wash their hands . They practice the tradition of the elders . )
When they come from the marketplace they wash themselves before they eat . They follow many other rules . They wash their cups , and brass pots , and other vessels .
The Pharisees and the scribes asked : » Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders . Instead they eat their bread with defiled hands ? «
He told them : » Isaiah prophesied about you hypocrites . It is written : ‘ This people honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me .
‘ They worship me in vain teaching as doctrines the commands of men . ’ «
Speaking to the Pharisees and scribes He said : » You abandon the commandment of God , and hold fast the tradition of men .
» You totally reject the commandment of God that you may keep your tradition .
» Moses said : ‘ Honor your father and your mother . He also said : ‘ He that speaks evil of father or mother must die . ’
» But you say : ‘ If a man says to his father or his mother that which would benefit you is a gift to God ,
he no longer has to do anything for his father or mother . ’
» You make the word of God invalid by your tradition . «
He called the crowd again and said : » Listen and understand !
» Nothing that goes into a person from the outside can make him unclean . That which comes from inside of a man can make him unclean .
» If any man has ears to hear , let him hear . «
When he entered the house away from the crowd his disciples asked him to explain .
He replied : » Do you not understand ? Do you not know that which goes into the man from the outside cannot defile him ?
» It is because it does not go into his heart , but into his stomach and is eliminated ? All foods are clean .
» That which comes out of the man defiles the man .
» It is from the heart that evil thoughts come such as : fornications , thefts , murders , adulteries ,
coveting , wickedness , deceit , loose conduct , envy , slander , pride , and foolishness .
» All these evil things come from within and defile the man . «
Jesus went to the territory of Tyre and Sidon . He did not want anyone to know that he was staying in a house there . However it could not be kept a secret .
A woman whose little daughter had an evil spirit heard about Jesus . She went to him and bowed down .
The woman was a Greek Syrophoenician by race . She wanted him to drive out the demon out of her daughter .
He said to her : » Let the children be fed first . It is not proper to take the children’s bread and cast it to the dogs . «
She answered : » Yes Lord , even the dogs under the table eat from the children’s crumbs . «
Then he replied : » Thanks to your answer you may leave for the demon has gone out of your daughter . «
She went to her house and found the child on the bed with the demon gone .
He left the borders of Tyre through Sidon , through the region of Decapolis to the Sea of Galilee .
They brought a deaf man with an impediment in his speech to him and asked him to lay his hands on him .
Jesus took him aside from the crowd privately , and put his fingers into his ears , and he spat , and touched his tongue .
Looking up to heaven he sighed and said to him : » Ephphatha , that is , be opened . «
His ears were opened . His tongue was freed and he spoke plainly .
Jesus told them not to tell anyone . The more he told them not to talk the more they talked .
They were beside themselves with amazement saying : He makes even the deaf hear and the dumb speak .
It was one of those days when there was a great crowd of people . They had nothing to eat so he called his disciples .
Jesus said : » I am concerned for these people because they continue with me now three days , and have nothing to eat .
» If I send them away to their houses with no food they will be weak and faint . Some of them have a long way to go . «
His disciples answered , » How could we get enough bread in this desolate place ? «
Jesus responded : » How much bread do you have ? « They said : » Seven loaves . «
He made the people sit on the ground . Then he took the seven loaves and gave thanks . He gave the broken bread to his disciples and they served the people .
They had some small fish . After blessing them he had them serve the people in the same way .
After eating they picked up seven baskets full of food .
About four thousand ate . Then he sent them away .
Immediately he entered a boat and he and his disciples traveled to Dalmanutha .
The Pharisees came to question him . They were testing him and seeking a sign from heaven .
He sighed deeply in his spirit and said : » Why does this generation seek a sign ? I tell you truly no sign will be given to this generation . «
He left them and boarded the boat and departed to the other side .
They forgot to take bread and they only had one loaf with them in the boat .
He ordered them to be aware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod .
They reasoned with one another saying : » We have no bread . «
Hearing this Jesus said : » Why do you reason about having no bread ? Do you not understand ? Are your hearts dull of understanding ?
» Having eyes , do you not see ? Having ears , do you not hear ? And do you not remember ?
» When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces did you up bring back ? « They answered : » Twelve . «
And the seven loaves among the four thousand , how many baskets full of broken pieces did you bring back ? And they told him : » Seven . «
He said : Do you not yet understand ?
They arrived at Bethsaida . A blind man was brought to him with the request to touch him .
He held the blind man’s hand and led him out of the village . Then he spit on his eyes and laid his hands on him . He asked him : » Do you see ? «
He answered : » I see men . They look like trees walking . «
He laid his hands on his eyes again and his vision was fully restored , he saw everything clearly .
He sent him to his home saying : » Do not enter into the village . «
Jesus and his disciples went into the villages of Caesarea Philippi . On the way he asked his disciples : » Who do men say I am ? «
They told him : » John the Baptist and others say Elijah . Some say you are one of the prophets . «
» Who do you say I am , « Jesus asked . They told him : » You are the Christ . «
He commanded them not to tell any man .
Then he taught them that the Son of man must suffer many things . The elders , chief priests , and the scribes will reject him . He will be killed and after three days he will rise from the dead .
Jesus spoke openly about this . Peter took him aside and rebuked him .
He turned around and looked at his disciples . Then he rebuked Peter saying : » Get behind me Satan for you do not pay attention to the things of God . You tend to the things of men . «
He then spoke to both his disciples and the crowd . He said : » If any man would come after me , let him deny himself and take up his stake and follow me .
» Whoever would save his life will lose it . Whoever would lose his life for my sake and the sake of the Good News will save it .
» What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his life ?
» What should a man give in exchange for his life ?
» For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation , the Son of man will also be ashamed of him , when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels . «
He continued : » Truly I tell you there are some here who will in no way experience death , till they see the kingdom of God come with power . «
Six days later Jesus took Peter , James and John up on a high mountain completely alone . He was transfigured in front of them .
His garments became brilliant white . Nothing on earth could make them this white .
Elijah and Moses appeared before them . They were talking with Jesus .
Peter said to Jesus : » Teacher it is good for us to be here . Let us make three tabernacles , one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . «
Peter and the others were afraid and they did not know what to say .
A cloud hovered over them and a voice came out of the cloud : » This is my Son the beloved listen to him ! «
Suddenly they saw no one near them except Jesus .
They came down the mountain . He warned them not to tell anyone what they had seen until after the Son of man had risen from the dead .
They kept questioning among themselves what the rising from the dead means .
Then they asked him how is it that the scribes say that Elijah must first come ?
He said : » Elijah does come first and restores all things . It is written that the Son of man should suffer and be treated with contempt ?
» But I say to you that Elijah has come . They have done to him what ever they wished just as it is written about him . «
When they came to the disciples they saw a great crowd with them and scribes questioning them .
Suddenly the crowd saw him and ran to him to greet him .
He asked them : » What are you talking about ? «
One of the people answered him : » Teacher I brought my son who is unable to talk because of a spirit .
» The spirit seizes him and slams him down . He foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth . I asked your disciples to cast it out but they could not do it . «
Jesus then said : » O faithless generation . How long will I be with you ? How long must I put up with you ? Bring him to me . «
They brought the boy to him . Suddenly the spirit threw him into convulsions . He fell on the ground rolled around and foamed at the mouth .
Jesus asked his father : » How long has this been going on ? « He said : » Since he was a child . «
Often it casts him into the fire and into the water to destroy him . If you can do anything have compassion on us and help us .
Jesus said to him : » All things are possible to him who has faith . «
Both father and child immediately shouted : » I have faith make my faith stronger . «
When Jesus saw the people he ordered the unclean spirit to come out of him . He commanded the spirit that caused the loss of voice and hearing to leave and never return to him .
The spirit cried out and shook the child violently . It came out and the child became like a dead person . Most of them said : » He is dead . «
Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up .
When the child went into the house his disciples asked him privately : » Why were we unable to send it out ? «
He replied : Only prayer will make this sort come out .
He desired that no man know about it . Therefore they left there through Galilee .
He taught his disciples : » The Son of man will be handed over to men who will put him to death . After three days he will come back from the dead . «
They did not understand and they were afraid to ask him about it .
They traveled to Capernaum . When they were in the house he asked them : » What were you talking about on the way ? «
They said nothing because they had had an argument between themselves about who was the greatest .
He sat down and the twelve came to him . He said : » If any man has the desire to be first , he would be last of all and servant of all . «
He put a little child in the middle of them and taking him in his arms he said to them :
» Whoever receives a little child in my name , receives me , and whoever receives me receives him who sent me . «
John spoke up : » Teacher , we saw someone who does not follow us casting out demons in your name . We tried to stop him because he does not follow us . «
But Jesus said : » Do not stop him , for there is no one who will do a mighty work in my name , and be able quickly to speak evil of me .
» For whoever is not against us is on our side .
» Whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my name , because you are Christ’s , most assuredly I tell you , he will in no way lose his reward .
» Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble , it would be better for him if a great millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the sea .
» If your hand causes you to stumble , cut it off . It would be better to enter into life maimed then , having two hands to be destroyed in the ever-burning trash fires in the Valley of Hinnom . Greek : Gehenna
» If your foot causes you to stumble , cut it off . It is good for you to enter into life with only one foot , rather than having two feet to be cast into the ever-burning fires of Hinnom . Greek : Gehenna : symbolic of total destruction
» If your eye causes you to stumble , cast it out . It is good for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be destroyed in the ever-burning trash fires in the valley of Hinnom .
» For every one will be salted with fire .
» Salt is good . If it loses its saltiness how can you make it salty again ? Have the salt or seasoning of friendship among yourselves , and live in peace with one another . «
Jesus crossed the Jordan River when he went to the province of Judea . Crowds gathered all around him just as they always did .
Some Pharisees came to him and tried to trap him . » Does our Law allow a man to divorce his wife ? « They asked .
» What did Moses command you ? « Jesus asked .
They said : » Moses allowed us to write a certificate of divorce and send her away . «
» He wrote this commandment because of your hard hearts , « Jesus replied .
» God made male and female from the beginning of creation .
» For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and unite with his wife .
» The two shall become one flesh . They are no longer two , but one flesh .
» That which God has joined together let not man take apart separate . «
In the house the disciples asked him again about this matter .
He said : » He who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her .
» If she divorces her husband and marries another , she commits adultery .
People were bringing little children to him so he could touch them . His disciples turned them away .
But when Jesus saw it he was moved with indignation . He said : » Allow the little children to come to me ! Do not turn them away for they belong to the kingdom of God .
» Truly I tell you , he who does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child shall not enter it . «
He took them in his arms , put his hands upon them and blessed them .
As he traveled someone ran to him , kneeled and asked him : » Good Teacher , what shall I do that I may inherit everlasting life ? «
Jesus asked him : » Why do you call me good ? None is good except God .
» You know the commandments , do not kill , do not commit adultery , do not steal , do not bear false witness , do not defraud , honor your father and mother . «
» Teacher , « he said : » I have observed all of these from my youth . «
Jesus lovingly looked at him and said : » You lack one thing . Go , sell your possessions and give to the poor . Then you will have treasure in heaven . Then come and follow me . «
He was very sad when he heard this for he had many possessions . Then he went away .
Looking around Jesus said to his disciples : » It is hard for those who have riches to enter into the kingdom of God ! «
The disciples were amazed at his words . Jesus repeated it again : » Children , it is hard to enter into the kingdom of God !
» It is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God . «
They were greatly astonished ! So they asked him : » Who can be saved ? «
Jesus looked at them : » With men it is impossible , but not with God : for all things are possible with God . «
Peter said to him : » We have left all and followed you . «
Jesus said : » Truly I tell you , a man that has left house , or brothers , or sisters , or mother , or father , or children , or lands , for my sake , and for the sake of the good news ,
will receive a hundred times as much now in this time , and in the age to come everlasting life .
» Many that are first will be last and the last first . «
Jesus went to Jerusalem . The disciples followed him . They were amazed at what Jesus did . Others followed and were afraid . He met with the twelve to tell them the things that were to happen to him .
» When we go to Jerusalem the Son of man will be turned over to the chief priests and the scribes . They will condemn him to death and hand him over to the people of the nations .
» They will mock him , spit on him , and scourge him . Then they will kill him . After three days he will rise again . «
James and John , the sons of Zebedee , came to him saying : » Teacher , we want you to do for us what we ask of you . «
He asked : » What do you want me to do for you ?
They said to him : » Allow us to sit next to you in your glory . One could sit on your right hand , and one on your left hand . «
» You do not know what you ask , « Jesus replied . » Are you able to drink the cup that I drink ? Are you able to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ? «
They said : » We are able . « Jesus replied : » The cup that I drink you will drink ; and with the baptism that I am baptized you will be baptized .
» But to sit on my right hand or on my left hand is not mine to give . It is for them for whom it has been prepared . «
When the ten heard it they were indignant with James and John .
Jesus called them together and said : » You know that those who rule over the nations lord it over them . Their great ones exercise authority over them .
» It is not so among you . Whoever would become great among you , shall be your minister servant attendant .
» Whoever would be first among you , shall be servant of all .
» For the Son of man also came not to be ministered to , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many . «
They arrived at Jericho . He left there with his disciples and a large crowd . A blind beggar named Bartimaeus , the son of Timaeus , was sitting by the side of the road .
When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene , he cried : » Jesus , son of David , have mercy on me ! «
Many rebuked him that he should keep quiet . However he cried out even more : » You son of David have mercy on me . «
Jesus stood still and said : » You call him . « They called the blind man saying to him , » Be of good cheer : rise , he calls you . «
Setting aside his garment , he sprang up , and came to Jesus .
Jesus responded to him : » What do you want me to do for you ? « The blind man said to him : » Teacher I want to receive my sight ! «
Jesus told him : » Go your way ; your faith has made you whole . And immediately he received his sight , and followed him in the way . «
They came close to Jerusalem , to Bethphage and Bethany , at the Mount of Olives . He appointed two of his disciples to
go into the village that is nearby . » As soon as you enter it you will find a colt tied there . No man has ever sat on that colt . Untie him and bring him .
» If any one questions why you do this say : ‘ The Lord has need of him . ’ ’ Immediately he will send it here . «
They found a colt tied at the door in the open street and they untied it .
Those who stood there asked why are you untying the colt ?
They told them what Jesus said and they let them go .
The colt was brought to Jesus . They laid their garments on him and Jesus sat on him .
Many spread their garments along the way . Others spread branches , which they cut from the fields .
Those who led the way and those who followed cried : » Hosanna ! Blessed is he who comes in Jehovah’s name !
» Blessed is the coming kingdom , the kingdom of our father David . Hosanna in the highest ! «
He entered Jerusalem and went to the temple . When evening came he went with the twelve to Bethany . ’
The next day they left Bethany . He was hungry .
He saw a fig tree far off . When he got closer he found nothing but leaves for it was not the season of figs .
He spoke about the tree that no man would ever eat fruit from it from that day forward .
When in Jerusalem he entered the temple and turned over the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of the people who sold doves .
He would not allow any man to carry merchandise through the temple .
When he taught , he said : » Is it not written , my house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations ? But you have made it a den of robbers . «
The chief priests and the scribes heard it , and sought how they might destroy him . They feared him because the crowd was astonished at his teaching .
And every evening he left the city .
They passed by in the morning and saw the fig tree withered away from the roots .
Peter remembered and said : » Teacher look , the fig tree that you cursed is withered away . «
Jesus answered : » Have faith in God .
» Truly I say faithful ones shall say to this mountain , be cast into the sea and it will happen . There must be no doubt in his heart and he must believe that what he says will come to pass .
» I tell you , believe that you receive what you pray for and you shall have it .
» When you say a prayer have forgiveness in your heart . Forgive anything you have against anyone so that your Heavenly Father will forgive you your sins . «
Chief priests and scribes approached him at the Temple in Jerusalem .
They said to him : » By what authority do you do these things ? Or who gave you authority to do these things ? «
Jesus said : » I will ask you one question . Give me an answer , and I will say by what authority I do these things . «
» The baptism of John was it from heaven or from men ? « Give me an answer .
They thought about it among themselves saying : » If we say from heaven he will say why did you not have faith in him ? «
They feared the people . » If we say from men the people would not like it because they all thought John was a true prophet . «
They told Jesus « » We have no idea . « Jesus said to them : » I should not say to you by what authority I do these things . «
He taught them with illustrations : » A man had a vineyard planted . He built a wall around it . He prepared a place for crushing out the wine and put up a tower . Then he rented it out to field workers , and went into another country .
» During the season he sent a servant to the field workers that he might receive the fruits of the vineyard .
» They beat him and sent him away empty .
» Again he sent another servant and they treated him shamefully and wounded him in the head .
» He sent another and they killed him . He sent many others and some were beaten and some were killed .
» Last of all he sent his son saying : ‘ They will respect my son . ’
» But those field workers said among themselves : This is the heir let us kill him and the inheritance shall be ours .
» They captured him and killed him . Then they cast his body out of the vineyard .
» What will the lord of the vineyard do ? He will destroy the field workers and give the vineyard to others .
» Have you not read this Scripture : ‘ The stone the builders rejected was made the chief corner stone . ’
» This was from Jehovah and it is marvelous in our eyes ? «
They tried to capture him but feared the crowd . They perceived that he spoke the illustration against them . So they left him and went away .
Pharisees and Herodians went to him that they might catch him in talk .
» Teacher , « they said , » we know that you are truthful , and not concerned about what other people think . You truthfully teach the way of God . Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar , or not ?
» Should we pay or should we not pay ? « Knowing their hypocrisy he said to them : « Why do you test me ? Show me a denarius . «
And they brought it . He said to them : » Whose is this image and superscription ? « They said : » Caesar’s . «
Jesus said : » Pay to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s , and to God the things that are God’s . « They greatly marveled at him .
Sadducees say that there is no resurrection . They came to him to ask a question :
» Teacher , Moses wrote that if a man’s brother die , and leave a wife behind him , and leave no child , that his brother should take his wife , and raise up seed for his brother .
» There were seven brothers the first took a wife , and dying left no seed .
» The second took her , and died , leaving no seed behind him . The third also died without leaving a seed .
» The seven left no seed . The woman also died .
» In the resurrection whose wife shall she be of them ? For each of the seven had her as wife . «
Jesus replied : » Is it not for this cause that you err ? You do not know the scriptures or the power of God .
» For when they shall rise from the dead , they neither marry , nor are given in marriage ; but are as angels in heaven .
» It is a fact that the dead will be raised again . Have you not read the account of the burning bush in the book of Moses ? Did you notice how God spoke to him , saying : I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ?
» He is not the God of the dead but of the living . You are greatly mistaken . «
One of the other scribes came to him with a question : » What commandment is the first of all ? «
Jesus answered : » The first is , Hear , O Israel ; Jehovah our God is one God Jehovah .
» You should love Jehovah your God with all your heart , and with all your being with every breath you take your life , with your entire mind and with all your strength .
» The second is you should love your neighbor as yourself . No other commandment is greater than these . «
The scribe said to him : » It is true teacher you ’ ve said it well that he is one and there is no one else besides him .
» To love him with all the heart , and with all understanding , and with total strength , and to love his neighbor as himself , is much more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices . «
When Jesus saw that he answered intelligently he said to him : » You are not far from the kingdom of God . No man dared ask any questions after that . «
Still teaching in the temple Jesus said : » Do the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David ?
» Inspired by Holy Spirit David said : ‘ Jehovah said to my Lord sit at my right hand , until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet . ’
» David called him Lord . How is it that he is his son ? « The people were pleased with what he said .
He said : » Beware of the scribes , who desire to walk in long robes , and to have greetings in the marketplaces .
» They demand the front seats in the synagogues and prominent places at feasts .
» They devour widows’ houses and for pretence make long prayers . These shall receive greater condemnation . «
He sat down near the collection boxes and observed how the crowd dropped money into the boxes . Many that were rich dropped in much .
A poor widow came along and dropped in two mites .
He told his disciples : » Truly I tell you this poor widow gave more then all the others who gave to the collection box .
» They all gave out of their surplus . She gave out of her poverty . She gave all that she owned , all her living . «
As he left the temple one of his disciples said to him : » Teacher look at these stones and the great buildings ! «
Jesus said : » See these great buildings ? Not one stone will be left upon another . They will all be thrown down . «
He sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple . Peter , James , John and Andrew asked him privately :
» Tell us when will these things be ? What will be the sign when these things are all about to be accomplished ? «
Jesus warned them : » Take heed that no man lead you astray .
» Many will come in my name Greek : onoma : claiming my authority , saying , I am he ; and will lead many astray .
» When you hear of wars and rumors reports of wars do not be troubled . These things must come to pass , but the end is not yet .
» Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom . There will be earthquakes in various places . There will be famines . These things are the beginning of pain sorrow trouble .
» Be on guard for they will deliver you up to courts . You will be beaten in the meeting places . You will be taken before governors and kings for a testimony to them for my sake .
» And the good news must first be preached to all the nations .
» When they deliver you up to judgment , do not worry before hand what you shall speak . Holy Spirit will give it to you at that time .
» Brother shall deliver up brother to death , and the father his child ; and children shall rise up against parents , and cause them to be put to death .
» All men will hate you because of my name . He who endures to the end will be saved .
» When you see the unclean thing that makes desolation standing where he ought not let the reader use discernment , then let them that are in Judea flee to the mountains .
» He who is on the housetop should not go down to enter and take anything out his house .
» He who is in the field should not return to take his clothes .
» Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days !
» Pray that this not be in the winter .
» The tribulation in these days will be greater then there has ever been from the beginning of God’s creation until now , and never shall be .
» Unless Jehovah shortened the days no flesh would be saved . For the sake of his chosen anointed he will shorten the days .
» If any man will say to you here is the Christ or there is the Christ do not believe it .
» There will arise false Christs and false prophets . They show signs and wonders that will mislead many , even the anointed .
» Be alert for I have told you all things beforehand .
» In those days after that tribulation , the sun will be darkened , and the moon will not give her light .
» The stars will fall from heaven and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken .
» They will see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory .
» He will send the angels to gather together his anointed from the four winds , from one end of the earth to the other end of heaven .
» Learn the illustration of the fig tree . When her branch is tender and she sprouts leaves you know summer is near .
» So when you see these things happening you know that he is near , even at the doors .
» Truly I tell you , this generation will not pass away until all these things are accomplished .
» Heaven and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away .
» No one knows the day or hour . The angels in heaven do not know . The Son of God does not know . Only the Father knows !
» Be awake beware be cautious and active , watch perceive and pray , for you do not know the time .
» It is similar to a man traveling to another country . He leaves his house and gives authority to his servants to do the work . He commands them to watch .
» Watch therefore for you do not know when the lord of the house comes . It could be in the evening , at midnight or in the morning when the cock crows .
» He could come suddenly and find you sleeping .
» What I say to you I say to all , be on the watch be vigilant stay awake be circumspect attentive and ready ! «
It was just two days until the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread . The chief priests and the scribes sought how they might quietly capture and kill him .
They said : » Not during the feast for it might cause the people to riot . «
He was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper . While he was dining a woman with an alabaster vase filled with costly perfume , of pure nard spikenard , brake it open and poured it over his head .
Some were very indignant over this . They asked , » What was the purpose of this waste of ointment ?
» This ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii . And the money could have been given to the poor . They scolded her . «
Jesus said : » Let her alone . Why do you trouble her ? She did a good thing to me .
» You always have the poor with you and you can do them good . You do not always have me .
» She did what she could ! She anointed my body beforehand for burying .
» Truly I tell you everywhere the good news is preached through out the whole world , that which this woman has done will be spoken of for a memorial of her . «
Judas Iscariot , one of the twelve , went away to the chief priests , that he might betray Jesus to them .
They were glad to hear it and promised to give him money . He looked for ways how he might conveniently deliver Jesus to them .
Now it was the first day of unleavened bread , when they sacrificed the Passover . His disciples said to him : » Where do you want to go to prepare to eat the Passover ? «
He sent two of his disciples into the city . He said : » Meet a man bearing a pitcher of water and follow him .
» Where he leads you say to the master of the house : The Teacher says where is my guest-chamber ? Where I shall eat the Passover with my disciples ?
» He will show you a large upper room . It is furnished and ready . Prepare it for us . «
The disciples went to the city and found everything as he described and they prepared for the Passover .
When it was evening he came with the twelve .
While they sat and ate Jesus said : » Truly I tell you , one of you will betray me , even he that eats with me . «
They were sorrowful and said to him one by one : » Is it I ? «
He said to them : » It is one of the twelve , he that dips with me in the dish .
» The Son of man goes even as it is written of him . Woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed ! It would have been better if he had not been born . «
While they were eating , he took bread , and after blessing it , he gave the broken bread to them , and said : » Take it , this means represents my body . «
He took a cup , and when he had given praise , he gave it to them and they all had a drink from it .
He said : » This means represents my blood of the covenant given for men .
» Truly I say to you , I will take no more of the fruit of the vine till the day when I take it new in the kingdom of God . «
After a song of praise to God they went to the Mount of Olives .
Jesus told them : » You would all be turned away from me . It is written , I will put the keeper of the sheep to death , and the sheep will be put to flight .
» After I am raised up , I will go before you to Galilee . «
Peter declared to him : » Even though all shall leave you I will not . «
Jesus said to Peter : » I tell you that before the rooster crows twice tonight , you will say three times that you do not know me . «
Peter answered even more strongly : » I will never say that , even if I have to die with you ! « All the other disciples said the same thing .
They came to a place called Gethsemane . He said to his disciples : » Sit here while I pray . «
He took Peter , James and John with him . He was very distressed and troubled .
He said to them : » I am very sorrowful to the point of death . Stay here with me and watch . «
He went forward a little ways and fell on the ground to pray . He prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him .
He said : » Abba , Father , all things are possible to you . Take this cup from me . Even so not what I will , but what you will . «
He returned to find them sleeping . He said to Peter , » Simon why do you sleep ? Could you not watch for one hour ?
» To avoid temptation watch and pray . The spirit truly is willing but the flesh is weak . «
Again he went away and prayed , and spoke the same words .
He came and found them asleep again . They did not know what to say to him .
He came a third time and said to them : » Sleep and take your rest . It is enough the hour has come . Look , the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners !
» Rise up and let us go . He that betrays me is near . «
Suddenly , as he spoke , Judas one of the twelve arrived . A great crowd with swords and spears were with him . They were from the chief priests , scribes and elders .
He who betrayed him gave them a sign . He told them the one I kiss is the one to capture and take away safely .
When he arrived he went straight to him and said : » Master « and kissed him .
They grabbed him and took him away .
One of those who were near took out his sword and gave the servant of the high priest a blow , cutting off his ear .
Jesus said : » Have you come out as against a thief with swords and sticks to take me ?
» I was with you every day in the Temple teaching and you did not take me . This is done so that the scriptures will be fulfilled . «
They all left him , and fled .
A young man followed him . He was wearing a linen cloth over his naked body . They tried to grab him .
But they got a hold of the linen cloth and he fled naked .
They led Jesus away to the high priest . The chief priests , elders and scribes came together with him .
Peter followed him at a distance . He followed into the court of the high priest . He was sitting with the officers staying warm by the fire .
Now the chief priests and the whole council looked for witness against Jesus to put him to death . They found none .
Many gave false witness against him . But their witness was not in agreement .
One person falsely witnessed against him by saying :
» We heard him say , I will destroy this temple that is made with hands , and in three days I will build another made without hands . «
Even so their witness did not agree .
The high priest stood in the middle of them , and said to Jesus : » Do you not answer ? What is it these say against you ? «
But he kept quiet and said nothing . Again the high priest questioned him : » Are you the Christ , the son of the Holy One ? «
Jesus said : » I am and you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of power , and coming with the clouds of heaven . «
Violently parting his robes , the high priest said : » What need do we have for more witnesses ? «
We have heard his words against God . What is your opinion ? They all said he should be put to death .
Some spit on him and covering his face they gave him blows . Guess who hit you , they said . The leaders took him and beat him with their hands .
Peter was still in the courtyard when one of the High Priest’s servant women came by .
When she saw Peter warming himself , she looked at him and said : » You were with Jesus of Nazareth . «
He denied it . » I do not know and I do not understand what you are talking about , « he answered . He went out into the passageway .
The servant woman saw him there and told bystanders , » He is one of them ! «
Peter denied it again . Later the bystanders accused Peter again saying : » You cannot deny that you are one of them , because you , too , are from Galilee . «
Then Peter said : » I swear I am telling the truth ! May God punish me if I lie ! I do not know the man you are talking about ! «
Then a rooster crowed . Peter remembered what Jesus said : » Before the rooster crows two times , you will deny me three times . « He broke down and cried .
Early in the morning the chief priests met hurriedly with the elders , the teachers of the Law , and the entire Council . They made their plans . They led Jesus away in chains and handed him over to Pilate .
Pilate questioned him : » Are you the king of the Jews ? « Jesus answered : » You say so . «
The chief priests accused him of many things .
Pilate again asked him : » Do you not answer ? See how many things they testify against you ! «
But Jesus gave no answer . Pilate wondered .
He used to release one prisoner at the feast . This was done by request .
Barabbas , a rebel and a murderer was available for this purpose .
The crowd cried aloud and asked him to do as he always did for them .
Pilate answered them , saying : » Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews ? «
For he knew that it was out of envy the chief priests delivered him up .
The chief priests influenced the crowd , that he should release Barabbas to them instead .
» What should I do with the one you call the King of the Jews ? « Pilate asked .
They cried out : » Impale him ! «
Pilate said : » Why , what evil has he done ? « But they cried out exceedingly , » Impale him ! «
Wishing to please the crowd , Pilate released Barabbas to them . Then he handed over Jesus . He was flogged and impaled .
The soldiers led him away to the court in the Praetorium building governor’s palace . They assembled together all of the troops .
They clothed him with purple . After weaving a crown of thorns they put it on him .
» Hail King of the Jews ! « They shouted at him .
They struck his head with a reed and spat on him . They bowed their knees in false adoration to him .
After they mocked him , they took the purple off of him , and put his own garments on him . They led him out to impale him .
Simon of Cyrene , the father of Alexander and Rufus was passing by on the road . They compelled forced him to go with them , that he might carry his stake .
They brought him to the place called Golgotha . This means the place of a skull .
They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink , but he did not take it .
After impaling him , they divided his garments among themselves , casting lots for them .
It was the third hour . They impaled him .
The superscription of his accusation was written on a board above his head , » THE KING OF THE JEWS . «
They impaled two robbers with him , one on his right hand , and one on his left .
The Scripture was fulfilled , which says , » He was numbered with transgressors . «
Those who passed by blasphemed him , wagging their heads , and saying , » ha ! You who destroy the temple , and build it in three days ,
save yourself , and come down from the stake ! «
Likewise , also the chief priests mocked among themselves with the scribes said , » He saved others . He cannot save himself .
» Let the Christ , the King of Israel , come down from the stake that we may see and believe him . « Those who were impaled with him also mocked him .
It was the sixth hour and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour .
At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , saying : » Eloi , Eloi , lama sabachthani ? « Interpreted it means , » My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? «
Some of those who stood by said : » He is calling Elijah . «
They filled a sponge full of vinegar , put it on a reed , and gave it to him to drink . Then they said let him be . Let us see whether Elijah comes to take him down .
Jesus cried out with a loud voice , and breathed his last breath of life .
The veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom .
The centurion who stood nearby heard him cry out his last breath . Then he said : » Truly this man was the Son of God ! «
The women watching from afar included : Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses , and Salome ,
who , when he was in Galilee , followed him and served him . Many other women came up with him to Jerusalem .
Evening arrived . It was the Preparation Day , the day before the Sabbath .
Joseph of Arimathaea was a prominent council member who also was looking for the Kingdom of God . He boldly approached Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body .
Pilate wondered if he were already dead . So he summoned the centurion and asked him about the death .
When the centurion confirmed it he granted the body to Joseph .
He bought a linen cloth , and taking him down , wound him in the linen cloth . Then he laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of a rock . He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb .
Mary Magdalene and Mary , the mother of Joses , saw where he was laid .
After Sabbath was over , Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James , and Salome , bought spices so they could anoint him .
They went to the tomb when the sun had risen . It was very early .
They asked each other who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb ?
The stone was very big . Looking up , they saw that the stone was rolled back .
They entered the tomb . They were amazed at what they saw . A young man dressed in a white robe was sitting on the right side of the tomb .
He said to them : » Do not be amazed . Jesus the Nazarene , who has been impaled , is not here . He has risen . Behold , the place where they laid him !
» Go tell his disciples and Peter that he goes before you into Galilee . There you will see him just as he told you . «
They fled from the tomb , for trembling and astonishment had come on them . They said nothing to anyone for they were afraid .
She told those who had been with him , for they mourned and wept .
When they heard that he was alive and she had seen him they did not believe it .
After this two of them saw him in another form as they walked , on their way into the country .
They went to tell the rest . They didn ’ t believe them , either .
Afterward he was revealed to the eleven as they sat at the table . He rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart , because they did not believe those who had seen him after he had risen .
He said to them , » Go into the entire world , and preach the good news to the whole creation .
» He who believes and is baptized will be saved . He who does not believe will be condemned .
» These signs will accompany those who believe . They will cast out demons in my name . They will speak with new languages .
» They will pick up and handle serpents . Deadly drink will not hurt them . They will lay hands on the sick , and they will recover . «
After he had spoken to them the Lord Jesus , was received up into heaven , and sat down at the right hand of God .
They went out and preached everywhere . The Lord worked with them and confirmed the word by the signs that followed . Amen .
Many have attempted to write an orderly narrative about the things that have taken place .
They received testimony from those who were eyewitnesses from the beginning . Ministers of God’s word delivered it to us .
Most excellent Theophilus Greek : Theo philos : friend of God : I have accurately traced the course of all things from the beginning . Now it seems good to me to write this report to you .
In this way you will know with certainty the truth that you were taught .
There was in the days of Herod , the king of Judea , a priest named Zechariah . He was of the priestly division of Abijah . He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron . Her name was Elizabeth .
They were both righteous before God . They blamelessly obeyed all the commandments and ordinances of God Greek : kurios : God .
They had no child for Elizabeth was barren and they both were well advanced in years .
He faithfully executed the priest’s duties before God .
The custom was to draw lots to see who served in the temple . It was his turn to enter into the temple of God and burn incense .
The whole crowd of people prayed outside at the hour of incense .
God’s angel appeared to him when he was standing on the right side of the altar of incense .
Zechariah was troubled . When he saw the angel he was filled with fear .
» Have no fear Zechariah , « said the angel , » for God has heard your prayer . Your wife Elisabeth will have a son and his name will be John .
» You will be filled with joy , and many will be happy at his birth .
» He will be great in the eyes of God . He will not drink wine or strong drink and he will be full of Holy Spirit from the time of his birth .
» Great numbers of the children of Israel will return to Jehovah their God because of him .
» He will go before God in the spirit and power of Elijah . He will turn the hearts of fathers to their children and wrongdoers to the way of righteousness . This will make ready a people whose hearts have been directed to Jehovah . «
Zechariah asked : » How might I be certain of this for my wife and I are old ? «
The angel answered : » I am Gabriel , whose place is before God . I have been sent to give you this good news .
» You will be without voice or language till the day when these things happen . Your lack of faith in what I say has caused this . «
The people were waiting for Zechariah . They were surprised he was in the Temple for such a long time .
When he came out he could not speak to them . They realized he saw a vision in the temple . Instead of talking he made signs to them .
When the days of his priestly service ended he went home .
His wife Elisabeth became pregnant . She remained in seclusion for five months .
She said : » This is the way God has dealt with me by taking away my reproach among men . «
The next month God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth in Galilee
to a virgin named Mary . Mary was engaged to Joseph , a descendant of King David .
Gabriel appeared to her and said : » Greetings highly favored one . God is with you . «
She was greatly troubled by this and wondered about the meaning of this salutation .
The angel said to Mary : » Do not fear for you have found favor with God .
» You will conceive in your womb and give birth to a son . You will call his name Jesus .
» He will be great . He will be called the Son of the Most High . Jehovah God will give him the throne of his father David .
» He will reign over the house of Jacob forever . His kingdom will not end . «
Mary asked the angel : » How is this to be for I have had no intercourse with a man ? «
The angel replied : » Holy Spirit would come to you and the power of the Most High will envelope you . Because of this the newborn will be called the Son of God . «
» Your relative Elisabeth has also conceived a son even in her old age . This so-called barren woman is in her sixth month .
» When God speaks , these things are possible . «
Mary said : » Look , Jehovah’s servant . Let it happen to me as you spoke . « The angel departed from her .
Mary traveled with haste to the city of Judah in the hill country .
She entered the home of Zechariah and greeted Elisabeth .
When Elisabeth heard the greeting from Mary , the babe leaped in her womb . Elisabeth was filled with Holy Spirit .
She shouted loudly : » Blessed are you among women , and blessed is the fruit of your womb ! «
» How is it that the mother of my Lord should come to me ?
» When I heard your greeting the baby leaped in my womb for joy .
» Blessed is she that believes . That which God spoke will be fulfilled . «
Mary said : » My life magnifies Jehovah my God .
» My heart and mind rejoice in God my Savior .
» He has looked on the low position of his servant . All generations from now on will call me blessed .
» He that is mighty has done great things to me . Holy is his name .
» His mercy is to all generations for all who respect him .
» He shows strength with his arm . He scatters the proud in the thoughts of their heart .
» He removes rulers from their thrones and exalts the humble .
» He fills the hungry with good things and sends the rich away empty handed .
» He has helped Israel his servant that he might remember mercy .
» He spoke to our fathers . To Abraham and his seed forever . «
Mary stayed with Elisabeth about three months , and returned to her house .
Now it was time for Elisabeth to give birth . She gave birth to a son .
Her neighbors and her relatives heard that Jehovah magnified his mercy towards her ; and they rejoiced with her .
On the eighth day they circumcised the child . They planned to call him Zechariah , after the name of the father .
His mother spoke up and said : » He shall be called John . «
They all said : » None of your relatives are called by this name . «
They made signs to his father , what he would have him called .
He asked for a writing tablet , and wrote , » His name is John . « They were all amazed .
Immediately his tongue loosed , his mouth opened and he spoke , blessing God .
Everyone nearby was in fear . These accounts spread abroad throughout all the hill country of Judea .
All that heard them wondered in their heart , saying , » What will this child be ? For the hand of Jehovah was with him . «
His father Zechariah was filled with Holy Spirit and prophesied , saying ,
» Blessed be Jehovah , the God of Israel . He has visited his people and brought them redemption .
» He raised up a horn of salvation power of deliverance for us in the house of his servant David
» He spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from ages past .
» He provided salvation from our enemies , and from the hand of all that hate us .
» He shows mercy towards our fathers and remembers his holy covenant .
» It was the oath he spoke to Abraham our father .
» He gave us deliverance out of the hand of our enemies so we could serve him without fear .
» May we serve in holiness and righteousness before him all our days .
» Your child will be called the prophet of the Most High . You will go in advance of Jehovah God to make his ways ready .
» To give knowledge of salvation to his people in the remission of their sins .
» A rising of light will visit us from on high because of the tender mercy of our God .
» The light will shine on them who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death . It will guide our feet into the way of peace . «
The child grew and became spiritually strong . He lived in the deserts till the time came to show himself to Israel .
In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that a census should be taken of all the inhabited earth .
This was the first census made when Quirinius was governor of Syria .
So every one went to his hometown to register .
Joseph came from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea to be counted and taxed . He went to the city of David , which is called Bethlehem , because he was of the house and family of David .
He registered himself with Mary , who was engaged to him . She was about to become a mother .
While they were there the time came for Mary to give birth .
She gave birth to her firstborn son . She wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger . That was because there was no room for them in the inn .
Shepherds in the same country were in the field keeping watch by night over their flock .
God’s angel stood by them and His glory gave illumination around them and they were very afraid .
The angel spoke to them : » Do not be afraid . Behold , I bring you good tidings of great joy to all the people .
» Christ Messiah the Lord , a Savior , is born this day in the city of David .
» This is the sign to you : You will find a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes , and lying in a manger . «
Suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly hosts praising God , and saying :
» Glory to God in the highest . Peace on earth among men with whom he is pleased . «
The angels went away from them into heaven . Then the shepherds said to one another , » Let us go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened , which God told us about . «
They hurried to see the baby . They found Mary and Joseph . And they saw the baby lying in the manger .
As soon as they saw it they told what they had heard about the child .
All that heard it wondered at the things that were spoken to them by the shepherds .
Mary remembered all these sayings , pondering them in her heart .
The shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen .
After eight days the baby was circumcised . He was called by the name , Jesus . Jesus : Jehovah is salvation This was the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb .
Following the days of their purification according to the Law of Moses they brought him up to Jerusalem . There they would present him to Jehovah .
It is written in God’s law that every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to Jehovah .
According to God’s Law they must offer a sacrifice of a pair of turtledoves , or two young pigeons .
There was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon . This man was righteous and devout . He was waiting for God to save Israel . God’s Holy Spirit was working in him .
Holy Spirit revealed to him that he would not die before he saw the Christ of Jehovah .
Under the power of the spirit he came to the temple . The parents brought in the child Jesus , that they obey the custom of the law .
He received him into his arms , and blessed God , and said :
» Let your servant depart according to your word in peace .
» My eyes have seen your salvation .
» That which you prepared before the peoples .
» It is a light of revelation to the nations , and the glory of your people Israel . «
Jesus’ father and mother were amazed at the things that were spoken concerning him .
Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother : » This child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel and for a sign that is spoken against .
» A sword will pierce through your mind that the thoughts of many hearts will be disclosed . «
Anna the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Asher was a very old prophetess .
She had been a widow eighty-four years . She never left the temple . She worshipped and fasted with supplications day and night .
Even up to that time she gave thanks to God and spoke to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem .
When they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of God they returned to Galilee , to their own city Nazareth .
The child grew and became strong . He was filled with wisdom and was blessed by God .
Every year his parents went to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover .
When he was twelve years old they went to the feast of the Passover , as was their custom .
When the feast ended they started the return trip . Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem and his parents did not know this .
They thought he was in the traveling company . After a day’s journey they looked for him among their relatives and friends .
When they could not find him they returned to Jerusalem to look for him .
After three days they found him in the temple , sitting in the midst of the teachers . He was listening and asking them questions .
All that heard him were amazed at his understanding .
When they saw him they were astonished . His mother said to him : » Son , why did you treat us this way ? Your father and I have searched for you and we have been worried . «
He said : » Why did you look for me ? Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house ? «
They did not understand what he said to them .
He went with them to Nazareth . He remained subject to them . His mother kept all these sayings in her heart .
Jesus grew in wisdom and stature , and in favor with God and men .
It was the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar . Pontius Pilate was governor of Judaea . Herod served as tetrarch of Galilee . Herod’s brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis . Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene .
This was in the time when Annas and Caiaphas were chief priests . The word of God was delivered to John the son of Zechariah . He was in the wilderness .
John traveled in the region near the Jordan , preaching the baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins .
This was according to the words of Isaiah the prophet : » The voice of one crying in the wilderness . Make ready the way of Jehovah . Make his paths straight .
» Every valley shall be filled . Every mountain and hill shall be brought low . The crooked shall become straight and the rough ways smooth .
» All flesh shall see the salvation of God . «
He told the crowds that came to be baptized by him : » You offspring of vipers , who warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
» Produce fruit that is worthy of repentance . Do not say we have Abraham for our father . I tell you , that God is able to make these stones into children for Abraham .
» The axe is now at the root of the trees . Every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown in to the fire . «
The people asked him : » What must we do ? «
He answered : » He who has two coats let him give to him who has none . He who has food let him do likewise . «
Tax collectors came to be baptized , and they asked him : » Teacher , what must we do ? «
He told them : » Collect no more than that which is prescribed . «
Soldiers also asked him : » What must we do ? « And he said : » Do not take money from any one by force . Never falsely accuse any one wrongfully and be content with your wages . «
Many people were expecting the Messiah . They reasoned in their hearts concerning John : » Perhaps he was the Messiah . «
John answered , saying to them : » I baptize you with water . He is coming who is mightier than I . I am not worthy to untie his shoelaces . He will baptize you in Holy Spirit and in fire .
» His winnowing fork is in his hand ready to thoroughly cleanse his threshing-floor . He will gather the wheat into his barn . He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire . «
He preached good news to the people by offering many encouraging words .
John reproved Herod the tetrarch for all the evil things he had done for he took his brother Herodias’ wife .
He added this also to them all . He locked up John in prison .
When all the people were baptized , Jesus also was baptized . He prayed and heaven was opened .
Holy Spirit descended upon him in a bodily form like a dove . A voice came out of heaven . He said : » You are my beloved Son . In you I am well pleased . «

Jesus was full of God’s Holy Spirit when he returned from the Jordan . Holy Spirit led him into the wilderness .
He spent forty days in the wilderness being tempted by the devil . He did not eat anything during those days so when it was over he was hungry .
The devil said to him : » If you are the Son of God command this stone to become bread . «
Jesus answered him : » It is written , man shall not live by bread alone . «
He led him up to a high place and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time .
Then the devil said : » I will give all this authority and glory to you , for it has been turned over to me . I may give it to whomever I will .
» If you will worship me it will all be yours . «
Jesus answered : » It is written , you shall worship Jehovah your God and him only shall you serve . «
He led him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle highest level of the temple . Then he said to him : » If you are the Son of God , cast yourself down from here .
» It is written , he shall give his angels charge concerning you to guard you .
» They will carry you with their hands so you do not dash your foot against a stone . «
Jesus replied : » It is said you should not test Jehovah your God . «
When the devil had completed every temptation he departed from him for a season .
Jesus was directed by God’s Spirit to return to Galilee . His reputation spread through out the region .
He taught in their synagogues and was praised by all .
Then he returned to Nazareth the place where he was raised . He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath day . This was his custom . There he stood up to read .
He was given the book of the prophet Isaiah . He opened the book and found the place where it was written :
» The Spirit of Jehovah is upon me . He anointed me to preach good news to the poor . He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives , and recovering of sight to the blind . To set at liberty those who are bruised .
» To proclaim the acceptable year of Jehovah . «
He closed the book , gave it back to the attendant and sat down . The eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him .
» Today , « he said , » you heard this scripture fulfilled . «
All witnessed this and wondered at the kind words that he spoke . They said : » Is this not Joseph’s son ? «
Then he said : » You will no doubt say this proverb to me , physician heal yourself . That which we heard was done at Capernaum do also here in your own country . «
He continued : » Truly I tell you no prophet is accepted welcomed honored in his own country .
» I tell you truth . There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah . There was no rain from heaven three years and six months . There came a great famine over all the land .
» Elijah was not sent to any of them . He was only sent to Zarephath in the land of Sidon . She was a widow .
» There were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet . Only one of them was cleansed , Naaman the Syrian . «
Everyone in the synagogue was angry when they heard these things .
They rose up to drive him out of the city . They led him to the top of the hill where their city was built to throw him down the hill .
But he passed through the midst of them and went his way .
Next he traveled to Capernaum , a city of Galilee . There he taught them on the Sabbath day .
They were astonished at his teaching for he spoke with authority .
A man in the synagogue had a spirit of an unclean demon . He cried out with a loud voice :
» What have we to do with you Jesus , you Nazarene ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are . You are the Holy One of God ! «
Jesus rebuked him , saying : » Be quiet and come out of him . « When the demon had thrown him down in front of them , he came out of him without harming him .
All were amazed and spoke to one another . » What is he telling us ? For he speaks with authority and with power he commands the unclean spirits and they come out . «
A rumor concerning him spread to every place of the region .
He left the synagogue and went to Simon’s house . Simon’s mother in law was suffering with a great fever . They asked him to help her .
He stood over her and rebuked the fever . It left her and immediately she rose up and ministered to them .
When the sun was setting they brought many who were sick of different diseases to him . He laid his hands on every one of them and healed them .
Demons came out from many . They cried out : » You are the Son of God ! « He rebuked them and charged them not to speak for they knew he was the Christ .
The next day he went to a secluded place . The crowds followed him . They did not want him to leave them .
He said to them : » I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other cities also . This is why I was sent . «
He preached in the synagogues of Galilee .
Jesus stood by the Lake of Gennesaret as the crowds pressed in upon him in order to hear the word of God .
He saw two boats docked by the shore . The fishermen had gone away from them and were washing their nets .
He boarded one of the boats . It was Simon’s boat . He asked him to put out a little from the land . And he sat down and taught the crowds from the boat .
When he finished speaking he asked Simon to put into deep water and let down the nets for a catch .
Simon answered , Master we worked all night and caught nothing . At your word I will let down the nets .
When they did this they caught a large number of fish and their nets were breaking .
They called their partners in the other boat to come and help them . They filled both boats until they began to sink .
When Simon Peter saw this he fell down at Jesus’ knees . He said : » Depart from me for I am a sinful man , O Lord . «
He and all who were with him were amazed at the catch of fish .
So were James and John , the sons of Zebedee , who were partners with Simon . Jesus said to Simon : » Do not fear . From now on you will catch men . «
After they brought their boats to land they left all and followed him .
One time while he was in one of the cities a man full of leprosy fell on his face before Jesus . He said : » Lord , if you want to you can make me clean . «
He stretched forth his hand and touched him , saying : » I want to , be made clean . « Immediately the leprosy departed from him .
He told him to tell no one and go and show himself to the priest . Then he was to make a cleansing offering , just as Moses commanded , for a testimony to them .
The news about him spread far away and large crowds gathered to hear him and to be healed of their infirmities .
He withdrew to a quiet place and prayed .
One day when he was teaching , Pharisees and doctors of the Law were in the crowd . People came from every village of Galilee , Judea and Jerusalem . God’s power was with him to heal .
Men brought a man on a bed . He was paralyzed . They tried to bring him in and lay him before Jesus .
They could not find a way to bring him in because of the crowd . So they went up to the housetop and let the man and the bed down through the tiles to Jesus .
Seeing their faith , Jesus said : » Man your sins are forgiven you . «
The scribes and the Pharisees reasoned saying : » Who is this that speaks blasphemies ? Who can forgive sins , but God alone ? «
Jesus perceived their reasoning and said to them : » Why do you reason in your hearts ?
» Which is easier to say your sins are forgiven or arise and walk ?
» So you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins , « he said to the man who was paralyzed , » I say to you , arise , take up your bed and go to your house . «
Immediately he rose up before them , took his bed and departed to his house , glorifying God .
Everyone was amazed and they glorified God . They were filled with fear . They said : » We have seen strange things today . «
After that he met a tax collector named Levi sitting at his place of business . He told him : » Follow me . «
He gave up everything and followed him .
Levi made him a great feast in his house . There was a large group of tax collectors and of others that were sitting at the meal with them .
And the Pharisees and their scribes complained to Jesus disciples . They asked : » Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners ? «
Jesus answered them : » Those who have good health do not need a physician . The sick do .
» I did not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance . «
They said : » The disciples of John fast often and make supplications . So do the disciples of the Pharisees . But yours eat and drink . «
Jesus replied : » Could you make the sons of the bride-chamber fast while the bridegroom is with them ?
» The days will come and when the bridegroom will be taken away from them . Then they will fast . «
He told an illustration to them : » No one takes a piece of cloth from a new garment and puts it on an old garment . Otherwise he will tear the new . Also the new will not match the old .
» No one puts new wine in old wine skins . The new wine will burst the old skins and spill the wine .
» But new wine must be put into fresh wine skins .
» After drinking old wine no one desires the new for the old is better . «
Jesus and his disciples went through the grain fields on a Sabbath . His disciples plucked the ears , rubbed them in their hands and ate .
Some of the Pharisees asked : » Why do you do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day ? «
Jesus answered : » Have you not read what David did when he was hungry . He and his companions ,
entered into the house of God . They and the others with them ate the showbread holy bread . It is only lawful for the priest to eat it . «
He continued : » The Son of man is lord of the Sabbath . «
He entered into the synagogue on the Sabbath and taught . There was a man there whose right hand was withered .
The scribes and the Pharisees watched to see if he would heal on the Sabbath . They looked for a way to accuse him .
He knew their thoughts . So he said to the man that had the withered hand : » Stand up and come here . « He arose and stepped forward .
Jesus said : » I ask you , is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm ? Is it lawful to save a life , or to destroy it ? «
He looked around at everyone and said to the man : » Stretch out your hand . « And he did so and his hand was restored .
They were all very angry and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus .
He went to the mountain to pray and he continued all night in prayer to God .
The next day he called his disciples to choose from them twelve , whom he named apostles ambassadors messengers :
Simon , whom he also named Peter , and Andrew his brother , and James and John , and Philip and Bartholomew ,
and Matthew and Thomas , and James the son of Alphaeus , and Simon who was called the Zealous one ,
And finally there was Judas the son of James , and Judas Iscariot , who became a traitor .
He came down with them , and stood on a level place . A great crowd of his disciples , and a great number of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem came to hear him . Others from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases .
Those who were troubled with unclean spirits were healed .
The crowd tried to touch him for power came forth from him and healed them all .
He looked at his disciples and said : » Blessed are you who are poor for yours is the kingdom of God .
» Blessed are you who hunger now for you shall be filled . Blessed are you who weep now : for you shall laugh .
» Blessed are you when men hate you , and when they separate you from their company , and reproach you , and cast out your name as evil , for the Son of man’s sake .
» Rejoice in that day and leap for joy . For your reward is great in heaven . Your fathers treated the prophets the same way .
» Woe to you who are rich ! You have received your reward .
» Woe to you who are full now ! For you will hunger . Woe to you who laugh now ! You will mourn and weep .
» Woe to you when all men speak well of you ! Their fathers did the same to the prophets .
» I tell you who listen , love your enemies and do good to those who hate you .
» Bless those who curse you . Pray for those who despitefully use you .
» When someone slaps you on one cheek offer the other . Give your coat to the one who takes your topcoat .
» Give to every one who asks of you and do not demand back your goods from he who takes from you .
» As you would like men to do to you , do also to them .
» If you love those who love you what thanks do you have ? Even sinners love those who love them .
» If you do good to those who do good to you what thanks do you have ? Even sinners do the same .
» If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive what thanks do you have ? Even sinners lend to sinners to receive again as much .
» Love your enemies and do good to them . Lend expecting nothing in return and your reward will be great . You will be sons of the Most High for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil .
» Be merciful even as your Father is merciful .
» Do not judge and you will not be judged . Do not condemn and you will not be condemned . Forgive and you will be forgiven .
» Give and it shall be given to you . You will receive a good measure . It will be pressed down , shaken together , running over and they will give it to you . For with the measure that you measure out it will be measured to you also . «
He told them an illustration : » Can the blind guide the blind ? Would they both fall into a pit ?
» The disciple is not above his teacher . Every one will be like his teacher when he is fully trained .
» Why do you see the speck in your brother’s eye ? Yet you do not consider the beam in your own eye .
» How can you say to your brother : ‘ Let me remove the speck in your eye when you do not notice the beam in your own eye ? ’ ’ You hypocrite ! First remove the beam from your own eye . Then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye .
» A good tree does not produce corrupt fruit and a corrupt tree does not produce good fruit .
» The identity of a tree is made clear by the fruit it produces . Men do not gather figs from thorns , nor do they gather grapes from a bramble .
» The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth that which is good . The evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth that which is evil . Out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks .
» Why do you call me Lord , and do not do what I tell you to do ?
» Every one who comes to me and hears my words and does them , I will show you to whom he is like .
» He is like a man building a house . He dug and laid a deep foundation upon the rock . A flood sent a stream of water against the house and could not shake it because it was well built .
» He who hears but does not do is like a man who built a house upon the earth without a foundation . A flood will send a stream of water and immediately it will fall . The ruin of that house will be great . «
After he taught the people he went to Capernaum .
A centurion’s servant , who was highly regarded by him , was sick and at the point of death .
When he heard about him he contacted Jesus through the Jewish elders . He asked him to come and save his servant .
They came to Jesus and earnestly pleaded with him saying : » He is worthy and you should do this for him .
» He loves our nation and he also built our synagogue for us . «
Jesus went with them . As he approached the house , the centurion sent friends to him saying , » Lord do not trouble yourself . I am not worthy that you should come under my roof .
» I am also not worthy to come to you . Just say the word , and my servant will be healed .
» I also am a man with much authority . I am in charge of soldiers and say to this one go and he goes and to another I say come and he comes . I tell my servant to do this and he does it . «
Jesus heard this and marveled at him . He turned to the crowd and said , » I tell you I find no greater faith in Israel . «
When the messengers returned to the house they found the servant in good health .
After that he , his disciples and a great crowd went to a city called Nain .
When he came near the gate of the city he saw people carrying a dead person . It was the only son of a widow . Many people were with her .
When the Lord saw her he had sympathy for her . » Do not cry , « he said .
He came near the casket and touched it . The bearers stood still . He said , » Young man arise . «
He who was dead sat up and spoke and he was returned to his mother .
They were all afraid and they praised God . They said : » A great prophet has appeared among us . God has visited inspected selected his people . «
News about him went through out all Judea and around the region .
The disciples of John told him the news .
John sent two of his disciples to the Lord . They asked , » Should we look for another or are you the one ? «
When the men found him they said : » John the Baptist sent us . Are you the one who comes or should we look for another ? «
In that hour he cured many diseases , plagues and evil spirits . Sight was restored to the blind .
He answered John’s disciples : » Go and tell John the things you have seen and heard . The blind receive their sight ! The lame walk and lepers are cleansed . The deaf hear ! The dead are raised up and the poor have good news preached to them .
» Blessed is he who is not offended by me . «
After John’s disciples departed he told the crowd about John : » What did you go into the wilderness to find ? Was it a reed shaken with the wind ?
» What did you go to see , a man clothed in fancy clothes ? Only kings dress in fancy clothes .
» What did you go out to see , a prophet ? Yes I tell you and much more than a prophet .
» This is he of whom it is written , Behold I send my messenger before you . He will prepare a way before you .
» I say to you , of those who are born of women there is none greater than John . Yet he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he . «
When the people heard , they acknowledged God’s justice . They received their baptism from John .
The Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God and were not baptized by him .
» To whom or what should I compare the men of this generation ?
They are like children that sit in the marketplace and call to each other . We played the flute for you but you did not dance . We wailed and you did not weep .
» John the Baptist came fasting and drinking no wine and you say he has a demon .
» The Son of man came eating and drinking , and you say look he is a gluttonous man , and a drunkard , a friend of tax collectors and sinners !
» All her children vindicate wisdom . «
One of the Pharisees asked him to dine with him . He went to the Pharisee’s house and sat down to eat .
A sinful woman went to the Pharisee’s house . She brought an alabaster vase filled with ointment .
Standing by his feet weeping , she wet his feet with her tears . She wiped them with the hair of her head . Then she kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment .
The Pharisee saw it and thought to himself if this man were a prophet he would know what kind of woman touched him . She is a sinner .
Jesus said to Simon : » I have something to tell you . « He replied : » What teacher ? «
» A certain lender had two debtors . One owed five hundred shillings and the other fifty .
» They did not have money to pay the debt so he forgave them both . Which of them did he love the most ? «
Simon answered : » I suppose it was the one whom he forgave the most . « Jesus said : » Your judgment is correct . «
Turning to the woman , he said to Simon : » See this woman ? I entered into your house and you gave me no water for my feet . She watered my feet with her tears , and wiped them with her hair .
» You did not kiss me . Since the time I came in she has not ceased kissing my feet .
» You did not anoint my head with oil . She anointed my feet with ointment .
» She loved much ! She has many sins and they are forgiven . When little is forgiven , little love is shown . «
He said to her : » Your sins are forgiven ! «
Those who ate with him said within themselves : » Who is this who even forgives sins ? «
He said to the woman : » You are saved because of your faith . Go in peace . «
Jesus and the twelve apostles traveled through cities and villages preaching the good news of the kingdom of God .
Traveling with him were the women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities . This included Mary Magdalene , from whom seven demons had gone out .
Also healed was Joanna the wife of Chuza , Herod’s steward , and Susanna . There were many others , who supported them out of their private substance .
A great crowd came to him from every city . He spoke to them with an illustration :
» The farmer went out to sow his seed . As he sowed some fell by the side of the road . It was trampled under foot and the birds of heaven devoured it .
» Other seed fell on the rock . As soon as it grew it withered away because it had no moisture .
» Still other seed fell among the thorns . The thorns grew with it , and choked it .
» Other seed fell on the good ground . It grew and produced fruit a hundredfold . « As he said these things he cried . He said : » He who has ears to hear let him hear . «
His disciples asked him what this illustration means .
He said : » You are meant to know the secrets of the kingdom of God . I speak to the rest in illustrations , that seeing they may not see and hearing they may not understand .
» Now the illustration is this : The seed is the word of God .
» Those by the side of the road are they who have heard . Then the devil comes and takes the word from their hearts that they may not believe and be saved .
» Those on the rock are those who receive the word with joy . These have no root . They believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away .
» The seeds that fell among the thorns are people who hear the word and go their own way . They are choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of this life , and do not produce fruit .
» The good ground represents the honest and good-hearted people . They hear the word , hold fast to it and produce forth fruit with patience . «
» No one lights a lamp and puts a cover over it or hides it under a bed . Instead he places it on a stand that everyone entering may see the light .
» Nothing is hidden that will not be revealed . Nothing is secret that will not be made known and come to light .
» Pay attention and hear ! Whoever has will be given more . Whoever does not have , more will be taken away , and even what he thinks he has will be taken . «
His mother and brother tried to come to him but could not because of the crowd .
They told him : » Your mother and your brothers are near . They wish to see you . «
He answered , » My mother and my brother are these who hear the word of God , and do it . «
He said to his disciples : » Let us go to the other side of the lake . « Then he and his disciples boarded a boat and did so .
Jesus fell asleep as they sailed to the other side . A large windstorm came to the lake . The boat was filling with water , and they were in danger .
They awoke him saying : » Master , Master , we parish ! « He rebuked the wind and the raging of the water and there was calm .
He asked them , » Were is your faith ? « They were afraid and they marveled . They asked : » Who then is this , that he commands even the winds and the water , and they obey him ? «
They arrived at the country of the Gerasenes , which is near Galilee .
When he arrived on the shore , a demon-possessed man met him . He wore no clothes and did not live in a house but in the tombs . He had been this way a long time .
When he saw Jesus he cried out and fell down in front of him . He shouted in a loud voice : » What have I to do with you , Jesus , you Son of the Most High God ? I implore you do not torment me . «
The spirit seized him many times . For this reason he was kept under guard , and bound with chains and fetters . Breaking the bands apart , he was driven by the demon into the deserts . Jesus commanded the unclean spirit to come out from the man !
Jesus asked him : » What is your name ? « He answered : » Legion « for many demons had entered into him .
They pleaded with him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss .
There was a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain . They entreated him that he would allow them to enter into them . He gave them permission .
The demons came out from the man and entered into the swine . The herd rushed down the hill into the lake , and was drowned .
The herdsmen saw what happened and rushed to the city to tell others .
They went out to see what happened . They came to Jesus and found the man who had been demon possessed . He was clothed , in his right mind and sitting at the feet of Jesus . They were afraid .
They then learned how he was possessed with demons and became whole .
The people of the country of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to depart . They were very much afraid . So he boarded a boat and left .
The man who once had demons asked him if he could go with him . Jesus sent him away saying :
» Return to your house and declare the great things God has done for you . « He went throughout the whole city telling the great things Jesus had done for him .
When Jesus returned the crowd welcomed him . They were all waiting for him .
Jairus , a ruler of the synagogue came to Jesus . He fell down at Jesus’ feet and implored him to come to his house .
His twelve-year old daughter was dying . She was his only daughter . As he went the crowds surrounded him .
There was a woman having an issue of blood twelve years . She spent all her money on physicians , and could not be healed by any .
She came behind him and touched the border of his garment . Immediately the issue of blood stopped .
Jesus said : » Who touched me ? « Peter and the others with him said : » Master , the people press in from all sides . «
Jesus said : » Someone did touch me . I perceived that power went from me . «
When the woman knew she was discovered she trembled , fell down before him and declared in the presence of all the people why she touched him , and how she was healed immediately .
He said to her : » Daughter , your faith has made you whole ; go in peace . «
While he yet spoke someone came from the ruler of the synagogue’s house saying : » Your daughter is dead do not trouble the teacher . «
When Jesus heard this he said : » Do not fear , only believe and she will be made whole . «
When he arrived at the house he allowed only the mother and father of the girl , Peter , John and James to enter with him .
They were all weeping and morning her . He said : » Do not weep for she is not dead , but sleeps . «
They laughed him to scorn knowing that she was dead .
He took her hand and called : » Maiden , arise . «
Her life force returned and she rose up immediately . He commanded that something be given her to eat .
Her parents were amazed . He charged them to tell no man what had been done .
He called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons , and to cure diseases .
He sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick .
He said , » Take nothing for your journey . Do not take a staff or food or money . Do not even take two coats .
» Stay at the house you enter until you depart .
» If someone does not receive you , when you leave the city , shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against that person . «
They departed and went throughout the villages preaching the good news , and healing everywhere .
Herod the ruler of Galilee heard of all that was done and was very perplexed confused skeptical . Some said John the Baptist was raised from the dead and that he did it .
Others said that Elijah had appeared and others and that one of the old prophets had risen again .
Herod said : » I beheaded John , but who is this , about whom I hear such things ? « He wanted to see him .
When the apostles returned they told Jesus about the things they had done . They traveled to the city of Bethsaida .
The crowds followed him and he welcomed them . He spoke to them about the kingdom of God . He healed many who were sick .
As the day wore on the twelve came to him and said : » Send the people away , that they may go into the villages and country nearby to find lodging and get food , for we are here in a lonely place . «
He said to them : » You feed them . « They replied : » We have no more than five loaves and two fishes unless we should go and buy food for all these people . «
There were about five thousand men . He said to his disciples , make them sit down in groups of about fifty each .
They did so , and made them all sit down .
He took the five loaves and the two fishes . Looking up to heaven , he blessed them and broke the bread . Then he gave them to the disciples to pass out to the crowd .
They ate and were all filled . Twelve baskets of left over pieces remained .
After he prayed the disciples went to him . He asked them : » Who do the crowds say that I am ? «
They said : » John the Baptist . Others say Elijah and still others say one of the old prophets has risen again . «
» But who do you say I am ? « He asked . Peter answered him : » The Christ of God . «
He commanded them to tell this to no man .
The Son of man must suffer many things , he told them . The elders , chief priests and scribes will reject him and kill him . The third day he will be raised up .
He told them all : » If any man would come after me let him deny himself . Let him take up his stake of self-denial daily , and follow me .
» He who would save his life shall lose it . He who would lose his life for my sake shall save it .
» For what does it profit a man if he gain the whole world , and lose or forfeit his own self ?
» If any man is ashamed of my teachings , and of me the Son of man will be ashamed of that person . This will happen when he comes in his own glory , and the glory of the Father , and of the holy angels .
» I tell you the truth , there are some here who shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of God . «
About eight days after he said these things he took Peter , John and James , and went up into the mountain to pray .
While he prayed his appearance changed and his clothes became white and brilliant .
Moses and Elijah talked to him .
They appeared in glory and spoke about the death he was about to experience at Jerusalem .
Peter and his companions were very sleepy . When they awoke they saw his brilliance and the two men that stood with him .
Before they left Peter said to Jesus : » Master it is good for us to be here . Let us make three tabernacles . We could make one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah . « He did not know what he was saying .
While he said these things a cloud enveloped them and they were filled with fear .
A voice came out of the cloud saying : » This is my Son my chosen one . Listen to him ! «
When the voice came Jesus was found alone . They kept quiet and told no man what they had seen .
After they came down from the mountain a large crowd met him .
A man in the crowd cried , » Teacher , please look at my son . He is my only child .
» A spirit controls him and suddenly he cries out . He foams at the mouth . It throws him into convulsions and he is badly bruised .
» I asked your disciples to cast it out and they could not . «
Jesus answered : » O faithless and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you , and put up with you ? Bring your son to me . «
When he came near the demon slammed him down and through him in to a convulsion . Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , healed the boy and gave him back to his father .
They were all overwhelmed by the greatness of God . Everyone marveled at all the things he did . Jesus said to his disciples :
» Let these words sink into your ears . The Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men . «
They did not understand what he said . The meaning was concealed from them . They could not comprehend it . And they were afraid to ask him about it .
They reasoned among themselves which of them was the greatest .
When Jesus detected the reasoning of their heart , he took a little child , and set him by his side .
Then he said to them : » Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me . Whoever receives me receives him who sent me . He who is least among you will be the greatest ! «
John said : » Master we saw some one casting out demons in your name . So we prevented him from doing this because he does not follow us . «
Jesus said : » Do not forbid him for he that is not against you is for you . «
The days were approaching for his ascension . He was determined to go to Jerusalem .
He sent messengers ahead of him . They entered the village of the Samaritans to get ready for him .
They did not receive him because he traveled to Jerusalem .
When his disciples James and John saw this they said : » Lord , do you want us to request fire from heaven to consume them ? «
He turned and rebuked them .
They went to another village .
On the way a man came to him and said : » I will follow you wherever you go . «
Jesus told him : » Foxes have holes and birds of heaven have nests , but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head . «
He told another : » Follow me . « But he said : » Lord first let me go bury my father . «
» Let the dead bury the dead . You go and publish abroad the kingdom of God . « Jesus replied .
Another said : » I will follow you Lord , but first let me go say good by to my relatives . «
Jesus responded : » No man , who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God . «
The Lord appointed seventy disciples and sent them in groups of two into every city and place where he was about to go .
He said to them : » The harvest indeed is great but the laborers are few . Pray that the Master Controller Lord of the harvest will send laborers into his harvest .
» Go your way for I send you as lambs in the midst of wolves .
» Carry no purse , no wallet , and no shoes ; and greet no man on the way .
» When you enter a house say ; may this house have peace .
» If a son of peace lives there , your peace shall rest upon him . If not , it shall return to you again .
» Remain in that house eating and drinking what they give you . The laborer is worthy of his hire . Do not stay in different houses .
» When they receive you in their city eat what ever they set before you .
» Heal the sick that are there and say to them , the kingdom of God is near you .
» If they do not receive you in their city go into their streets and ,
» Shake off the dust that clings to your feet , from that city , so they may know that the kingdom of God came near .
» I tell you , it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom , than for that city .
» Woe to you Chorazin ! Woe to you Bethsaida ! If the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon , which were done in you , they would have repented long ago , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
» It will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you .
» Will you Capernaum be exalted to heaven ? You will be brought down to the grave .
» He that hears you hears me ; and he that rejects you rejects me and he that rejects me rejects him that sent me . «
The seventy returned with joy , saying , » Lord , even the demons are subject to us in your name . «
He said to them : » I saw Satan falling like lightning from heaven .
» Behold , I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions , and over all the power of the enemy : and nothing shall in any way hurt you .
» Do not rejoice about this that the spirits are subject to you . Rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven . «
In that same hour he rejoiced in Holy Spirit and said : » I thank you Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that you did hide these things from the wise and the understanding and revealed them to babes . Father , it is pleasing in your sight .
» All things have been delivered to me from my Father . No one knows who the Son is except the Father . And no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son is willing to reveal him . «
Turning to the disciples , he said privately : » Blessed are the eyes that see the things you see .
» I tell you many prophets and kings desired to see the things you see and did not see them . To hear the things you hear and did not hear them . «
A lawyer stood up to test him . He asked : » Teacher what shall I do to inherit everlasting life ? «
He said : » What is written in the law ? How do you read it ? «
He answered : » Love Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your life , with all your strength and with all your mind . Feelings and total existence Might and total thinking capacity And you should love your neighbor as yourself . «
He told him : » You answered correctly , do this and you will live . «
Desiring to justify himself , he said to Jesus : » Who is my neighbor ? «
Jesus answered : » A man traveled from Jerusalem to Jericho . He fell among robbers . They stripped him , beat him and left him half dead .
» A priest traveled on that road . When he saw him he passed by on the other side .
» When a Levite came to the place he saw the man and passed by on the other side .
» Then a Samaritan arrived where he was . He was moved with compassion when he saw him .
» He went to him and bandaged his wounds pouring oil and wine on them . He set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn to take care of him .
» The next day he paid the host two shillings . He said take care of him and if you spend more I will repay you when I return .
» Which of these three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers ? «
He said : » The one who showed mercy to him . « Jesus said to him : » Go and you do like wise . «
Along the way he entered a village . A woman named Martha received him into her house .
Her sister Mary sat at the Lord’s feet and heard his word .
Martha was worried about the housework . She approached Jesus and said : » Lord do you not care that my sister does not help me ? Tell her to help me . «
The Lord answered : » Martha , Martha , you are anxious and troubled about many things .
» However one thing is needed . Mary has chosen the proper way and it shall not be taken away from her . «
Jesus was praying . When he finished one of his disciples said to him : » Lord , teach us to pray , just as John taught his disciples . «
He said : » When you pray say , ‘ Father holy sacred sanctified blessed consecrated is your name . Let your kingdom come .
» Give us day-by-day our daily bread .
» Forgive us our sins . For we also forgive everyone who sins against us . And keep us from temptation . «
He also said : » Which of you have a friend you would approach at midnight and say lend me three loaves .
» This is because a friend of mine is visiting and I do not have any food to feed him .
» You hear a voice from the house say , ‘ The door is shut , my children are in bed , do not bother me . I cannot rise and help you . ’ «
» I tell you even if he will not rise and give you what you need because he is your friend , he will arise and give you what you need because you keep asking .
» I say to you : Ask and it will be given you . Seek and you will find . Knock and it will be opened to you .
» Every one who asks receives . Everyone who seeks will find . It will be opened to everyone who knocks .
» What father would give his son a stone when he asked for a loaf ? What father would give a serpent when his son asked for a fish ?
» If he asked for an egg would he give a scorpion ?
» If you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him ? «
He cast out a demon from a dumb man . When the demon left the man he spoke and the crowds were astonished .
Some of them said : » Beelzebub the prince of the demons casts out demons . «
Others tested him demanding a sign from heaven .
He knew their thoughts . So he told them : » Every kingdom that is divided is destroyed . A house divided against itself falls .
» If Satan is divided against himself how will his kingdom stand ? You say I cast out demons with the help of Beelzebub .
» If Beelzebub helps me cast out demons , who helps your sons cast them out ? They will be your judges .
» If I use the finger power Spirit of God to cast out demons , then the kingdom of God has come upon you ?
» When the fully armed strong man guards his own palace , his goods are safe .
» When some one stronger comes to him and overpowers him he takes away his armor and steels his possessions .
» He who is not with me is against me . He who does not help me gather actually scatters .
» When an unclean spirit leaves a man it passes through desolate places . It seeks rest and finds none . It says , ‘ I will return from where I came . ’
» When he returns he finds the place swept and adorned .
» He then takes seven other spirits more evil than himself and they enter in and dwell . The last condition of that man becomes worse than the first . «
As he was talking a woman out of the crowd shouted : » Blessed is the woman who bore you and nursed you . «
He replied : » More blessed are those who hear the word of God and obey it . «
When the crowd gathered to him , he said : » This generation is evil . It seeks a sign . No sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah .
» Just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites ; the Son of man will be a sign to this generation .
» The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation . She will condemn them for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the Wisdom of Solomon and one greater than Solomon is here now .
» The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation . They will condemn it for they repented at the preaching of Jonah and someone greater than Jonah is here now .
» No man lights a lamp and puts it in a cellar or under a bushel . He puts it on a table so those who enter may see the light .
» The lamp of your body is your eye . When your eye is clear your entire body is full of light . When it is evil your body is full of darkness .
» Make sure the light that is in you is not darkness .
If your entire body is full of light and has no darkness you will have no part of the dark . Just as a lamp when shinning brightly gives plenty of light . «
As he spoke a Pharisee invited him to dine with him . He accepted the invitation and went to eat .
The Pharisee wondered about Jesus not bathing before dinner .
The Lord said : » You Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter . Yet your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness .
» You foolish ones . Did he that made the outside also make the inside ?
« Give that which is within as charity . Then all things are clean for you .
» Woe to you Pharisees ! You tithe mint and rue and every herb , and pass over justice and the love of God . You should have done these but you leave them undone .
» Woe to you Pharisees ! You love the prominent seats in the synagogues , and the greetings in the marketplaces .
» Woe to you ! You are as the tombs that do not appear and men walk over them and do not know it . «
One of the lawyers said to him : » Teacher , you also insult us by saying this . «
Jesus said : » Woe to you lawyers also ! For you load men with burdens that are difficult to bear . And you will not even touch the burdens with one of your fingers .
» Woe to you ! For you build the tombs of the prophets , and your fathers killed them .
» Therefore you are witnesses and consent to the works of your fathers . They killed them and you build their tombs .
» It is for this reason the wisdom of God said , ‘ I send to them prophets and apostles and they will persecute and kill some of them . ’
» The blood of all the prophets shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation .
» This includes the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah , who perished between the altar and the sanctuary . I tell you it will be required of this generation .
» Woe to you lawyers , for you took away the key of knowledge . You did not enter in yourselves and you hindered those entering . «
When he left there the scribes and the Pharisees became hostile with him . They tried to quarrel with him about many things .
They plotted against him and tried to catch him in something he might say .
Thousands of people in the crowd were gathered together so much that they bumped into one another . He said to his disciples : » First of all , beware of the leaven of the Pharisees , which is hypocrisy .
» Everything covered up will be revealed . Everything hidden will be made known .
» That which you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light . That which you have spoken in the inner chambers will be proclaimed on the housetops .
» I tell you my friends , do not be afraid of those who kill the body . After that they can do no more .
» I will show you the one to fear . Fear the one who , after he has killed , has power to destroy you throw into the ever-burning trash fires of the valley of Hinnom Greek : Gehenna . This is one you should fear .
» Are not five sparrows sold for two coins of small value ? Yet not one of them is forgotten in the sight of God .
» Even the very hairs of your head are all numbered . So do not fear . You are worth more than many sparrows .
» I tell you , every one who confesses me before men ; the Son of man will also confess him before the angels of God .
» He who denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the angels of God .
» He who speaks against the Son of man will be forgiven . However he who blasphemes against Holy Spirit will not be forgiven .
» When you are brought before the synagogues , the rulers , and the authorities , do not worry about what you will say to answer them .
» Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you should say . «
A member of the crowd said : » Teacher , help my brother divide the inheritance with me . «
Then he said : » Man , who made me a judge or a divider over you ? «
Jesus said : » Be careful , do not covet , for life does not come from your possessions . «
He spoke an illustration to them : » The land of a rich man produced well .
» He reasoned to himself , what will I do ? I have nowhere to store my fruits ?
» He said : » I would pull down my barns and build larger barns . I will store all my grain and goods there .
» I will say to my self : ‘ You have many possessions saved for many years . Take it easy and eat , drink and be merry . ’
» But God said to him : ‘ You fool this night you will give up your life . Then who will have all these things you accumulated ? ’
» He who lays up earthly treasure for himself is not rich toward God . «
He told his disciples : » Therefore I say to you , do not be anxious for your life , what you eat or what you wear on your body .
» Life is more than food and clothing .
» Consider the ravens for they do not sow or reap . They have no storehouse or barn . Yet God feeds them . How much more valuable are you than the birds !
» Which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to your life ?
» If you are not able to do even that which is least why worry about the rest ?
» Consider the way the lilies grow . They do not toil and neither do they spin . Yet I tell you even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
» If God clothes the grasses in the field , which is here today and is cast into the oven tomorrow , how much more will he clothe you ? You have little faith .
» Do not seek food and drink and do not worry .
» For the people of the nations seek after these things . Your Father knows that you need them .
» Seek first his kingdom and these things will be added to you .
» Do not fear little flock for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom .
» Sell your possessions and give to charity . Make yourselves purses that do not get old , a treasure in heaven where moth and rest cannot corrupt and thieves cannot steal .
» Your heart will be where your treasure is .
» Gird your loins strengthen yourselves and light your lamps .
» Be like men looking for their master to return . He will knock when he returns from the marriage feast , and it will immediately be opened to him .
» Those servants are blessed , for the master will find them alert when he comes . I tell you he will tighten his belt , have them sit down at the table , and he will serve them the meal .
» Even if he comes in the second watch or the third and he finds the same his servants are blessed .
» Know this , that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming he would have watched . He would not have allowed his house to be broken into .
» You be ready ! The Son of man will come at a time when you do not think he will . «
Peter said : » Lord are you speaking this illustration to us or to everyone ? «
The Lord said : » Who is the faithful and wise steward , whom his master shall appoint over his household , to give them their food at the proper time ?
» That servant will be blessed when his master comes and finds him doing so .
» I tell you the truth , he will put him in charge of all that he has .
» If that servant says in his heart , my master delays his coming ; and beats the other servants and eats and drinks to excess ,
the master of that servant will come when he does not expect . He will come in an hour that he does not know . He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers .
» The unfaithful servant who knew what his master wanted and did not do it will be beaten .
» He who did not know and did things unacceptable will receive a lesser punishment . To whom much is given , much will be required and to whom they commit much they will demand even more .
« I came to strike fire upon the earth and what do I care if it is already kindled ?
» I have a baptism to experience and I am distressed until it is accomplished !
» Do you think I have come to give peace in the earth ? I tell you , No , instead division .
» From now on there will be five in one house divided , three against two , and two against three .
» They will be divided , father against son , and son against father ; mother against daughter , and daughter against her mother ; mother in law against her daughter in law , and daughter in law against her mother in law . «
He said to the crowd : » When you see a cloud rising in the west , you say it will rain and it does .
» When you see a south wind blowing , you say there will be scorching heat and there is .
» You hypocrites , you know how to interpret the face of the earth and the heaven but how is it that you do not know how to interpret this time ?
» Why do you not judge what is right ?
» For example when an opponent brings you to court , try to settle before you get there . Otherwise , he will drag you in front of a judge and the judge will hand you over to an officer who will throw you into prison .
» I tell you that you will not get out until you pay every penny of your fine . «
Some people there gave him an account of how Pilate killed some Galilaeans while they offered sacrifices .
Jesus said : » Do you think the way those Galileans were killed prove they were worse sinners than all Galileans ?
» It does not ! I tell you ; if you do not turn from your sins , you will die as they did .
» What about the eighteen people in Siloam killed when the castle tower fell on them ? Do you think this proves that they were worse than all the other people living in Jerusalem ?
» It does not ! I tell you if you do not turn from your sins , you will die as they did . «
Jesus told them an illustration : » There was a man who had a fig tree growing in his vineyard . He looked for figs on it but found none .
» So he told his gardener , I have been coming here looking for figs on this tree for three years . I have not found any . So cut it down ! Why should it continue using the soil ?
» But the gardener said : Just give it one more year , sir . I will dig around it , fertilize it and leave it alone .
» If the tree bears figs next year it will be good . If it does not you can have it cut down . «
Jesus was teaching in the synagogue on the Sabbath .
A woman had an evil spirit that kept her sick for eighteen years . She was bent over and could not stand straight .
Jesus called to her : » Woman you are free from your sickness ! «
He touched her and at once she stood straight up and praised God .
The official of the synagogue was angry that Jesus healed on the Sabbath . He told the people : » There are six days in which we should work . Come during those days and be healed , not on the Sabbath ! «
The Lord answered : » You hypocrites ! You would untie your ox or your donkey from the stall and take it out to give it water on the Sabbath .
» Here is a descendant of Abraham whom Satan has kept in bonds for eighteen years . Should she be released on the Sabbath ? «
His answer shamed his enemies . The people rejoiced over the wonderful things he did .
Jesus continued : » To what shall I compare the Kingdom of God ? What is it like ? «
» It is like this . A man plants a mustard seed in his field . The plant grows and becomes a tree . The birds make their nests in its branches . «
Again Jesus asked : » With what should I compare the Kingdom of God ?
« It is like this . A woman takes some yeast and mixes it with a bushel of flour . Soon the whole batch of dough rises . «
Jesus went through towns and villages , teaching the people and traveling toward Jerusalem .
Someone asked him , » Will only a few people be saved ? « Jesus answered them :
» Strive to go in through the narrow door . Many people will try to go in and will not be able .
» The master of the house will close the door . You stand outside and knock on the door and say : ‘ Open the door for us , sir ! ’ ’ He will answer : ‘ I do not know where you come from ! ’
» Then you will answer , we ate and drank with you . You taught in our town !
» Again he will say : ‘ I do not know where you come from . Get away from me , you wicked people ! ’
» You will cry and grind your teeth when you see Abraham , Isaac , Jacob , and all the prophets in the Kingdom of God , while you are thrown out !
» People will come from east , west , north and south and sit down at the feast in the Kingdom of God .
» Those who are last will be first , and those who are first will be last . «
Some Pharisees came to Jesus and warned him : » You must leave and go somewhere else for Herod wants to kill you . «
Jesus told them : » Go tell that fox I cast out demons and heal people today and tomorrow . On the third day my work will be finished .
« I must go on my way today , tomorrow and the following day . It would not be right that a prophet perish outside of Jerusalem .
» O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , you who kill the prophets ! You stone those sent to you . How often I would have gathered your children together , even as a hen gathers her own brood under her wings . But you would not have it !
» Behold , your house is made desolate . I tell you , you shall not see me until you say blessed is he who comes in the name of Jehovah . «
Shortly after that he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees . They were there to eat on the Sabbath . They watched him .
There was in his presence a man who had the dropsy swollen arms and legs .
Jesus spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees : » Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath , or not ? «
They did not speak . So he held the man and healed him and let him go .
He said : » Which of you who has an ass or a bull that falls into a well , and will not immediately pull him up on a Sabbath day ? «
Again they could not answer .
He spoke an illustration to the invited guests . He noticed they chose from the most important seats . So he said to them :
» When you are invited to a marriage feast do not take the place of honor . Someone more distinguished than you may be invited .
» Your host would tell you , give this person your place . Then you would be embarrassed and have to take the place of least honor .
» When you are invited , take the place of least honor . Then , when your host comes , he will tell you , friend , move to a more honorable place . And the other guests will see how you are honored .
» Those who exalt themselves will be humbled . And people who humble themselves will be exalted . «
Jesus said to his host : » When you give a lunch or a dinner , do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or your rich neighbors . They will invite you back , and in this way you will be paid for what you did .
» When you give a feast , invite the poor , the crippled , the lame , and the blind .
» You will be blessed because they are not able to pay you back . God will repay you on the day the good people rise from death . «
One of the guests at the table then said to Jesus : » Those who sit down at the feast in the Kingdom of God will be happy ! «
Jesus said : » There was a man who gave a great feast to which he invited many people .
» He sent his servant to tell the guests that everything is ready .
» They all made excuses one after another . The first one told the servant : ‘ I bought a field and must go and look at it . Please accept my apologies . ’
» Another said : ‘ I purchased five pairs of oxen and am on my way to try them out . Please accept my apologies . ’
» Another explained : ‘ I am newly married and I cannot come . ’
» The servant returned and conveyed this to his master . The master was furious . He commanded his servant to hurry into the streets and alleys of the town , and bring back the poor , the crippled , the blind , and the lame .
» The servant soon told his master , ‘ Your order has been carried out but there is still more room . ’
» The master told the servant , ‘ Go to the country roads and lanes and make people come so my house will be full . ’
» None of those who were invited will taste my dinner ! « He said .
Jesus turned to speak to the large crowd of people who were traveling with him :
» You who come to me may not be my disciple unless you love me more than you love your father and mother , wife and children , brothers and sisters and yourself .
» Those who do not carry their own stake and come after me may not be my disciples .
» If you plan to build a tower , you sit down first and figure out what it will cost . Then you see if you have enough money to finish the job .
» If you do not , you will not be able to finish the project after laying the foundation . Everyone who sees what happened will ridicule and poke fun of you .
» ‘ You started and could not finish , ’ ’ they will say .
« When a king commands ten thousand men to fight another king who comes against him with twenty thousand men , he will sit down first and decide if he is strong enough to defeat the other king .
» If he is not strong enough he will send messengers to the other king to ask for terms of peace while he is still far away . «
» Likewise , « concluded Jesus , » none of you may be my disciples unless you give up everything you have . «
» Salt is good . But if it loses its saltiness it cannot be made salty again .
» It is neither good for the soil nor for the manure pile . You throw it away . Listen if you have ears ! «
One day a large number of tax collectors and other outcasts came to listen to Jesus .
Pharisees and teachers of the Law complained : » This man welcomes sinners and even eats with them ! «
Then Jesus told them an illustration :
» If you have a hundred sheep and lose one of them , what do you do ? You leave the other ninety-nine sheep in the pasture and go looking for the one you lost until you find it .
» When you find it you are happy . You carry it on your shoulders .
» You bring it back home . You invite your friends and neighbors together to celebrate . You say , ‘ I am so happy I found my lost sheep . ’
» It is the same . I tell you , there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine good people who do not need to repent .
» Suppose a woman with ten silver coins loses one of them . What does she do ? She lights a lamp and sweeps her house . She looks carefully everywhere until she finds it .
» When she finds it she calls her friends and says let us celebrate . I am happy I found the lost coin .
» I tell you , it is the same for the angels of God who rejoice over one sinner who repents . «
Jesus said : » A man had two sons .
» The younger one said to him , Father I want my share of the property . He divided his property between his two sons .
» In a short time the younger son sold his share of the property . He left home with the money and traveled to a far away country where he wasted his money in reckless living .
» He spent everything ! When a famine spread over that country he was left with nothing .
» He went to work for a citizen of that country who sent him to his farm to take care of the pigs .
He wanted to eat the Carob bean pods the pigs ate , but no one gave him anything to eat .
» Finally it dawned on him , my father’s hired workers have more than they can eat and I am about to starve !
» I will go to my father and say : ‘ Father I have sinned against God and against you .
» I am not fit to be called your son . Treat me as one of your hired workers . ’
» He went to his father . He was a long way from home when his father saw him . His heart filled with pity . He ran and threw his arms around his son and kissed him .
» Father , the son said : ‘ I have sinned against God and against you . I am not fit to be called your son . ’
» The father called his servants . He said : ‘ Hurry and bring the best robe and put it on him . Put a ring on his finger and shoes on his feet .
» ‘ Get the prize calf and kill it . Let us celebrate with a feast !
» ‘ My son was dead . Now he is alive . He was lost . Now he has been found . The feasting began . ’
» The older son was out in the field . When he came close to the house he heard music and dancing .
« He asked one of the servants what was happening ?
» Your brother returned home , the servant answered . Your father killed the prize calf because he has returned safely .
» The older brother was so angry he would not enter the house . His father came out and begged him to come in .
» He spoke to his father in anger . All these years I have worked like a slave for you . I have never disobeyed you . What have you given me ? Not even a goat for me to have a feast with my friends !
» This son of yours wasted all your property on prostitutes . When he comes home you kill the prize calf for him !
» The father answered , » My son , you are always here . And everything I have is yours !
» ‘ We had to celebrate and be happy . Your brother was dead . Now he is alive ! He was lost and now he has been found ! ’ «
Jesus told his disciples : » There was a rich man who had a servant who managed his property . The rich man learned that the manager was accused of wasting his master’s money .
» He said : ‘ Is it true what I hear about you ? Give me a complete accounting of your management of my property for you may not be my manager any longer . ’
» The servant thought : ‘ I am fired from my job . What shall I do ? I am not strong enough for heavy work and I am ashamed to beg .
» ‘ I know what I will do when my job is gone . My friends will welcome me in their homes . ’
» He called all the people who were in debt to his master . He asked the first one : ‘ How much do you owe my master ? ’
» ‘ One hundred barrels of olive oil , ’ ’ he said . ‘ Here is your bill , ’ ’ he told him ; ‘ settle for fifty . ’
» He asked another : ‘ How much do you owe ? ’ ’ ‘ A thousand bushels of wheat , ’ ’ he answered . ‘ Here is your bill . Pay eight hundred bushels . ’
» The master of the dishonest manager praised him for doing a shrewd thing . People of this world are more astute at handling their affairs than people who belong to the light .
Jesus continued : » I tell you , make friends for yourselves with worldly wealth . That way when it gives out , you will be welcomed in the eternal home .
» Whoever is faithful in little things will be faithful in large ones . Whoever is unrighteous in small things will be unrighteous in large ones .
» If you have not been faithful in handling worldly wealth , how can you be trusted with true wealth ?
» If you have not been faithful with what belongs to someone else , who will give you what belongs to you ?
» No one can serve two masters . He will hate one and love the other . He will be loyal to one and despise the other . You cannot serve both God and money . «
Hearing this the Pharisees made fun of Jesus , because they loved money .
Jesus said : » You make yourselves look righteous to other people . God knows your hearts . The things considered of great value by people are worth nothing in God’s sight .
» The Law of Moses and the writings of the prophets was in effect until John the Baptist . From that time on the Good News about the Kingdom of God is being taught .
« It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the smallest detail of the Law to be eliminated .
» A man who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery . The man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery . Jesus continued to tell illustrations .
» A rich man dressed in the most expensive clothes and lived in great luxury every day .
» A poor man named Lazarus , covered with sores , used to be brought to the rich man’s door .
» He hoped he could eat the bits of food that fell from the rich man’s table . Then the dogs would come and lick his sores .
» The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham’s bosom . The rich man died and was buried .
» He was in great torment in the grave hades . He looked up and saw Abraham , far away , with Lazarus at his side .
» He called out : Father Abraham ! Take pity on me ! Please send Lazarus to dip his finger in some water and cool off my tongue . I am in torment in this fire !
» Abraham said : Remember , my son , in your lifetime you were given good things , while Lazarus got all the bad things . Now he is enjoying himself while you are in torment .
» There is a deep pit lying between us , so that those who want to cross over from here to you cannot do so . And no one can cross over to us from where you are .
» The rich man said : I beg you , father Abraham , send Lazarus to my father’s house .
» Have him go warn my five brothers that they will not come to this place of torment .
» Abraham said : Your brothers have Moses and the prophets to warn them . They should listen to them .
« The rich man responded : It is not enough father Abraham ! If someone from the dead went to them they would repent .
» Abraham said : If they would not listen to Moses and the prophets , they would not listen to someone from the dead . «
Jesus told his disciples : » Things that cause people to stumble do happen . However it is a terrible thing for someone to make them happen !
» It would be better for him to have a large millstone tied around his neck and be thrown into the sea than for him to cause one of these little ones to sin .
» So watch how you behave . Admonish your brother to repent when he sins . Forgive him when he repents .
» If he sins against you seven times in one day and repents each time , you must forgive him . «
The apostles said to the Lord : » Increase our faith . «
He answered : » If your faith was as big as a mustard seed ; you could say to this mulberry tree , uproot yourself and plant yourself in the sea and it would obey you !
» Let us say you have a servant who is plowing or looking after the sheep . Do you tell him to hurry and eat his meal when he comes in from the field ?
» No you do not . You say to him get my supper ready . Put on your apron and wait on me while I eat and drink . After that you may have your meal .
Does the servant deserve thanks for obeying orders ?
The same applies to you . When you have done all you have been told to do , you say , we are unworthy servants . We have done what we ought to have done . «
Jesus traveled to Jerusalem . He went along the border between Samaria and Galilee .
Entering a village he met ten men suffering from a dreaded skin disease .
They shouted : » Jesus ! Master ! Have pity on us ! «
When he saw them he told them to go show themselves to the priests . They were cleansed on the way .
When he was healed , one of them came back and praised God in a loud voice .
He fell on his face at Jesus feet and thanked him . He was a Samaritan .
Jesus answered : » Were all ten cleansed ? Where are the nine ?
» Were the others not willing to return with this foreigner to give glory to God ?
He said : » Arise and go your way . Your faith has made you whole . «
The Pharisees asked : » When does the kingdom of God come ? « Jesus answered them : » The kingdom of God does not come with observable signs .
» Neither shall they say it is here or over there ! The kingdom of God is here with you in your midst among you . «
He said to the disciples : » The time will come when you shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man , and you shall not see it .
» They will tell you go here or go there , but do not follow them .
» Just as the light from lightning shines from one part of the sky to another part of the sky , so the Son of man will be in his day .
» First he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation .
» The days of the Son of man will be like the days of Noah .
» They ate , they drank and they got married until Noah entered the ark . Then the flood came , and destroyed them all .
» The days of Lot were similar . They ate , they drank , they bought , they sold , they planted and they built .
» But when Lot left Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven , and destroyed them all .
» It will be similar in the day that the Son of man is revealed .
» A man will be on the housetop . He should not go down into the house to take his possessions . He that is in the field should likewise not return to the house .
» Remember Lot’s wife !
» He who seeks to gain his life will lose it . He who loses his life will preserve it .
» I tell you , that on that night there will be two in one bed . One will be taken learn be received and the other will be left omited forsaken .
» There will be two grinding together . One will be taken and the other will be left .
» There will be two men in the field . One will be taken and the other will be left . «
They asked him : » Where , Lord ? « And he said to them : » Where the body is the eagles will also gather . «
He spoke an illustration to them emphasizing the need to pray and not become tired :
» There was a judge in a city that did not fear God and had no respect for man .
» There was a widow in that same city . She went to him asking for legal protection from her adversary .
» At first he refused . Then he thought about it and he said to himself , I do not fear God and have little respect for man .
» However this widow bothers me . For this reason I will avenge her . If she keeps coming to me she will wear me out . «
The Lord continued : » Pay attention to what the unrighteous judge said . «
» Should God avenge his chosen that cry to him day and night , and yet he is longsuffering over them ?
» I say to you , that he will avenge them quickly . Nevertheless , will the Son of man find faith on the earth when he comes ? »
He then spoke this illustration to some who trusted in themselves . They were very self-righteous . They looked down on others :
» Two men went to the temple to pray . One was a Pharisee , and the other was a tax collector .
» The Pharisee stood and prayed like this : God , I thank you , that I am not like the rest of men , extortionists , unjust , adulterers , or even as this tax collector .
» I fast twice per week . I give tithes of all that I get .
» But the tax collector stood far away and would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven . He beat his breast , saying : God , be merciful to me a sinner .
» I tell you the tax collector and not the Pharisee was right with God when he went home . He who exalts himself will be humbled ! He who humbles himself will be exalted ! «
They brought all their babes to him that he should touch them . When the disciples saw it they rebuked them .
Jesus said : » Invite the little children to come to me , and do not forbid them for the kingdom of God belongs to them .
» Truly I tell you he who does not receive the kingdom of God like little child , shall in no wise enter it . «
A Jewish leader asked : » Good Teacher what shall I do to inherit eternal life ? «
Jesus asked : » Why do you call me good ? None is good except one , God .
» You know the commandments , do not commit adultery , do not kill , do not steal , and do not bear false witness . Honor your father and mother . «
The man replied : » I have observed all these things from my youth . «
When Jesus heard it he said to him , » You lack one thing . Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven . Then come and follow me . «
But when he heard these things he became very sad for he was very rich .
Seeing him Jesus said : » It is very difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
» It is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle’s eye , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God . «
They heard this and asked : » Than who can be saved ? «
He replied : » The things that are impossible with men are possible with God . «
Peter said : » Indeed we have left our own to follow you . «
Jesus said : » Truly I tell you , no man has left house , or wife , or brother , or parents , or children , for the sake of the kingdom of God ,
who shall not receive manifold more now and in the age to come everlasting life . «
He took the twelve to Jerusalem so that the Son of man will accomplish all the things that are written through the prophets :
» He will be delivered up to the people of the nations , and will be mocked , and shamefully treated , and spit upon .
» They will beat and kill him . The third day he will rise . «
They did not understand for the meaning was hidden from them . They could not perceive the things he said .
He came closer to Jericho where a blind man sat begging by the side or the road .
Hearing a crowd go by , he inquired what this meant .
They told him : » Jesus of Nazareth passed by . «
He cried out : » Jesus , you son of David , have mercy on me ! «
They rebuked him and said he should keep quiet . But he cried out even more : » You son of David , have mercy on me ! «
Jesus commanded that he be brought to him . When he was near he spoke to him .
What do you want me to do to you ? He said : » Lord , give me my sight ! «
And Jesus said to him : » Receive your sight ! Your faith has made you whole . «
Immediately he received his sight , and followed him , glorifying God . All the people who saw it praised God .
Jesus passed through Jericho .
There was an important , wealthy , chief tax collector called Zacchaeus .
He tried to see who Jesus was . Being a short person he could not see over the crowd .
So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore fig-mulberry tree near where he would pass by in order to see him .
When Jesus came to the place he looked up at Zacchaeus and said : » Come down quickly for today I must visit your home . «
He hurried down to receive him joyfully .
Many in the crowd complained saying : » He is staying with a man who is a sinner . «
Zacchaeus stood before Jesus and said : » Lord , I now give half of all my possessions to the poor . If I have defrauded any one I will give back four times the amount taken . «
Jesus said to him : » Salvation has come to this house today . He is also a son of Abraham .
» The Son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost . «
They were close to Jerusalem . They assumed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately . Jesus responded to their assumption with an illustration .
He said : » A nobleman traveled to a country far away to receive for himself a kingdom , and to return .
» He called ten of his servants and gave them ten pounds , and said do business with this until I return .
» His citizens hated him . They sent a spokesman to him saying we do not want this man to rule us .
» He received the kingdom and went back to check on his servants . He wanted to know what they had gained by trading with the money he gave them .
» The first reported : Your pound has made ten pounds more .
» He said : Well done , you good servant . You were faithful in very little . Now you shall have authority over ten cities .
» The second said : Your pound , Lord , has made five pounds .
» He replied : You should be over five cities .
» Another reported : Lord , here is your pound . I kept it stored in a napkin .
» I feared you because you are an austere man . You take up what you do not lay down and you reap that which you did not sow .
» He said to him : Out of your own mouth I will judge you , you wicked servant . You knew that I am an austere man , taking up that which I did not lay down , and reaping that which I did not sow .
» Why did you not put my money in the bank ? That way I could collect interest when I returned .
» The nobleman said : Take away the pound he was given and give it to him that has the ten pounds .
» They said : Lord he has ten pounds !
» I say to you , that every one who has more shall be given . The man who does not have what little he has shall be taken away from him .
» Bring my enemies that do not want me to rule over them and kill them in front of me . «
After Jesus spoke he went to Jerusalem .
When he came close to Bethphage and Bethany , at the Mount of Olives , he sent two of the disciples .
He told them , » Go into the nearby village . You will find a colt tied . No man has ever sat on him . Untie him and bring him to me .
» If any one asks why you untied him say the Lord needs him . «
They left and found things to be as he said .
The owners found them when they untied the colt and asked why do you untie the colt ?
They said : » The Lord needs him . «
They brought him to Jesus . Then they threw their garments on the colt and Jesus sat on him .
As he went , they spread their garments in the way .
He was near the descent of the Mount of Olives . The entire crowd of disciples rejoiced and praised God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen .
They said : » Blessed is the King that comes in the name of Jehovah ! Peace in heaven , and glory in the highest heaven ! «
Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him , » Teacher , rebuke your disciples . «
He answered : » I tell you if these remain quiet the stones will cry out ! «
When he came close to the city he wept over it .
He said : » If you only knew today the things needed to bring peace ! But they are hidden from your eyes .
» The time is coming when your enemies will surround you and blockade you with a rampart wall on all sides . They will close in on you .
» They will knock you and your children down to the ground . They will not leave one stone upon another . What’s more you do not know when this visit will take place . «
Jesus entered the temple and drove out the merchants .
He said : » It is written my house shall be a house of prayer . You have made it a den of robbers . «
Everyday he taught in the temple . The chief priests , scribes and other important men of the people looked for ways to destroy him .
They could not find a way for the people listened to every thing he said .
One day when he was teaching the people in the temple , and preaching the good news he saw the chief priests , scribes and elders .
They said to him : » Tell us by what authority do you do these things ? Who gave you this authority ? «
Jesus responded : » I also will ask you a question . Tell me ,
» The baptism of John was it from heaven or from men ? «
They reasoned among themselves , » If we say from heaven ; he will say why did you not believe him ?
» If we say from men all the people will stone us . They are persuaded that John was a prophet . «
So they answered : » We do not know . «
Jesus said : » Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things . «
He told the people an illustration : » A man planted a vineyard . He rented it to tenants and went to another country for a long time .
» At harvest time he sent a servant to the renters to collect fruit of the vineyard . The renters beat him , and sent him away empty .
» He sent another servant who was also treated shamefully , beaten and sent away empty .
» A third servant was sent . They wounded him and threw him out .
» The owner of the vineyard said , what should I do ? I will send my beloved son . Maybe they will respect him .
» When the renters saw him they reasoned that this is the heir , let us kill him , that the inheritance may be ours .
» They threw him out of the vineyard and killed him . What will the owner of the vineyard do to them ?
He will come and destroy the renters and will give the vineyard to others . When they heard it , they said , God forbid !
» He looked at them and asked what does the scripture mean : The stone that the builders rejected the same was made the head of the corner ?
» Every one that falls on that stone shall be broken to pieces . Every one the stone falls on will be scattered as dust . «
The scribes and the chief priests attempted to capture him in that very hour . They feared the people . They perceived that he spoke this illustration against them .
They watched him and sent out spies , who pretended to be righteous . The spies listened for something in his speech to deliver him up to the authority of the governor .
» Teacher , « they said , » we know that you are right in what you say and teach . You are not partial and do not play favorites . Rather you teach the way of God truthfully . «
» Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not ? «
He perceived their craftiness , and replied :
» Show me a denarius . Whose image and superscription does it have ? « They said , » Caesar’s . «
He said to them : » Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s , and to God the things that are God’s . «
They were not able to apprehend him in front of the people . They were amazed by his answer and kept quiet .
Some Sadducees came to him . They believe there is no resurrection .
They asked him : » Teacher , Moses wrote if a man’s brother dies and he is childless , his brother should take the wife , and raise up seed for his brother .
» There were seven brothers . The first took a wife , and died childless .
» The same for the second .
» The third married her . The remaining of the seven also married her , left no children and died .
» Afterward the woman also died .
» In the resurrection whose wife shall she be ? All seven married her . «
Jesus said , » The sons of this age marry , and are given in marriage .
» Those accounted worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry , nor are given in marriage .
» They cannot die anymore for they are equal to the angels . They are sons of God , being sons of the resurrection .
» Even Moses showed that the dead are raised when he was near the bush and he called Jehovah the God of Abraham , Isaac and Jacob .
He is not the God of the dead , but of the living : for all live for him . «
Some of the scribes answered , » Teacher you have said well . «
They did not dare to ask any more questions .
He asked them a question : » How is it that they say the Christ is David’s son ?
» For David said in the book of Psalms : Jehovah said to my Lord , Sit at my right hand .
» Till I make your enemies a footstool for your feet .
» David therefore called him Lord , and how is he his son ? «
He spoke to the disciples while all the people listened :
» Beware of the scribes for they walk around in long robes . They love greetings in the marketplaces . They sit in the chief seats in the synagogues and the head tables at feasts .
» They devour widows’ houses . They offer long prayers to show off in front of others . They shall receive great condemnation . «
He saw rich men putting their gifts into the treasury .
Then he saw a poor widow putting in two small coins .
» I tell you a truth , « he said : » This poor widow gave more than all of them .
» They all gave out of their surplus but she gave out of her poverty . She gave all that she had for living expenses . «
Some spoke of how wonderful the temple was . How it was adorned with beautiful stones and offerings , Jesus replied :
» Concerning these things you see , the days will come , in which there shall not be left here one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down . «
They asked him : » Teacher , when would these things take place ? What will be the sign when these things are about to come to pass ? «
He said : » Take heed that you are not led astray . Many will come in my name , saying , I am he but the time is not at hand . Do not follow them .
» When you hear of wars and disturbances do not be terrified . These things must occur first . The end is not immediate . «
Then he said : » Nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom .
» There will be great earthquakes . There will be famines and pestilences in various places . There shall be terrors and great signs from heaven .
» Even before all these things , they will capture you , and persecute you . You will be delivered to synagogues and prisons . You will be brought before kings and governors for my name’s sake .
» It will give you an opportunity to witness .
» Do not think about what you will say before it happens .
» I will give you ability to talk and words of wisdom , which your adversaries shall not be able to resist or refute .
» Parent , brothers and sisters and friends will turn you over and cause you to be put to death .
» Men will hate you because of my name .
» Yet not a hair of your head will perish .
» You will gain your lives because of your endurance .
» When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies you will know that desolation is near .
» Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains . Let those who are in the midst of her leave . And let no one from the country enter .
» These are days of vengeance ! All things written will be fulfilled .
» Woe to those who are pregnant and those who nurse a child in those days ! There will be great distress upon the land , and wrath to this people .
» They will be killed by the edge of the sword . Some will be led captive into all the nations . The people of the nations will tread down Jerusalem until the time of the Nations is fulfilled .
» There will be signs in sun and moon and stars . The earth will experience distress of nations in disarray for the roaring of the sea and the waves .
» Men will faint out of fear for expectation of the things coming on the world . The powers of the heavens shall be shaken .
» Then they will see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
» When these things begin to happen lift up your heads because your redemption draws near . «
He told them an illustration : » Look at the fig tree , and all the trees .
» When they produce leaves you know that summer is near .
» Even so , when you see these things coming to pass , know that the kingdom of God is near !
» Truly I say to you , this generation shall not pass away , till all things are accomplished .
» Heaven and earth will pass away : but my words will not pass away .
» Be awake so your hearts are not weighed down . Do not allow the weight of worldly involvement , drunkenness , and cares of this life be a snare when that day suddenly comes .
» It will come as a surprise to all who dwell on the face of the earth .
» Be on the watch all the time . Pray for the strength to escape all these things in order to stand before the Son of man . «
He taught in the temple every day and he stayed on the Mount of Olives at night .
The people came early in the morning to hear him in the temple .
The feast of unleavened bread was near . This is called the Passover .
The chief priests and the scribes searched for a way to put him to death . But they feared the people .
Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot . He was one of the twelve .
He went away to discuss with the chief priests and captains , how he might deliver Jesus to them .
They were glad , and pledged to give him money .
He consented and looked for a way to deliver him to them in the absence of the crowd .
The day of unleavened bread came , on which the Passover must be sacrificed .
Jesus sent Peter and John , saying : » Go make everything ready that we may eat the Passover . «
They asked him : » Where do you want us to get ready ? «
He said : » When you enter the city a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you . Follow him into the house .
» Say to the master of the house : The teacher says ; ‘ where is the guest chamber where I shall eat the Passover with my disciples ? ’
» He will show you a large furnished upper room . Make it ready . «
They found things as he described them and they made things ready for the Passover .
When it was time he sat down with the apostles .
He said to them : » I have earnestly wanted to eat this Passover with you before I die .
» I tell you I will not eat it again until it takes place in the kingdom of God . «
He received a cup , and when he had given thanks , he said : » Take this , and share it among yourselves .
» I say to you , I shall not drink from the fruit of the vine , until the kingdom of God comes . «
He gave thanks . Then he took the bread , broke it and gave it to them , saying : » This represents my body that is given for you . Do this in remembrance of me . «
Then he took the cup saying : « This represents the new covenant in my blood , which is poured out for you .
» Look , he who betrays me is at the table .
» The Son of man indeed goes , as it has been determined . But woe to that man through whom he is betrayed ! «
They questioned among themselves , which of them would do this thing .
Contention grew between them concerning which of them was the greatest .
He told them : » The kings of the nations have lordship over them . Those who have authority over them are called Benefactors .
» But you should not be this way . He who is the greater among you let him become as the younger . He that is chief among you is he who serves .
» Which is greater , he who sits and eats or he who serves ? Is it he who sits and eats ? However I am in the midst of you as he who serves .
» You have continued with me in my temptations .
» I assigned a kingdom to you just as my Father assigned it to me .
» Just as you eat and drink at my table in my kingdom ; you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
» Simon , Simon , behold , Satan asked to have you , that he might sift you as wheat .
» I prayed for you that your faith would not fail . Once you have turned again strengthen your brothers . «
He said : » Lord , I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death . «
Jesus said : » I tell you Peter , the cock shall not crow this day , until you deny that you know me three times . «
Speaking to them he asked : » When I sent you out without purse , and wallet , and shoes , did you lack anything ? « They said : » Nothing . «
Now he said : » Take your purse and wallet . If you do not have a sword sell your cloak and buy one .
» I tell you that which is written must be fulfilled in me . He was numbered with transgressors for that which concerns me has fulfillment . «
They said : » Lord , here are two swords . « And he said to them : » It is enough . «
He went to the Mount of Olives as was his custom and the disciples also followed him .
When he arrived he said to them : » Pray that you do not enter into temptation . «
He went a short distance from them and kneeled down and prayed .
He prayed : » Father if it is your will remove this cup from me , nevertheless not my will , but your will be done . «
An angel came to him and gave him strength .
When he finished his prayer he went to the disciples , and found them sleeping because of their sorrow .
He said : » Why do you sleep ? Arise and pray that you do not enter into temptation . «
As he spoke a crowd followed Judas , one of the twelve . They came to him . Judas approached Jesus and kissed him .
Jesus said to him : » Judas , do you betray the Son of man with a kiss ? «
Those near him saw what happened and asked : » Lord shall we strike them with a sword ? «
One of them struck the servant of the high priest , and cut off his right ear .
Jesus said : » Do not do any more of this . « Then he touched his ear and healed him .
Jesus spoke to the chief priests , captains of the temple and elders who came against him : » Did you come as you would against a robber with swords and clubs ?
» I was with you every day in the temple . Yet you did not lift a hand against me . This is your hour for this power of darkness . «
They seized him and led him away . They took him to the high priest’s house . Peter followed from a distance .
They kindled a fire in the midst of the court . They sat down together . Peter sat in the midst of them .
A servant girl saw him sitting by the light of the fire . She looked steadfastly upon him and said : » This man was also with him . «
He denied it saying : » Woman , I do not know him ! «
After a little while another saw him , and said : » You are one of them . « Peter replied : » Man I am not ! «
Another hour passed . Someone else said : » It is true this man was with him for he is a Galilean . «
Peter responded : » I do not know what you are talking about ! « Immediately , while he spoke he heard the cockcrow .
The Lord turned and looked at Peter . Peter remembered the word of the Lord , how he said to him : » Before the cockcrow this day you will deny me three times . «
He left there and wept bitterly .
The men that held Jesus mocked him and beat him .
They blindfolded him , and asked him , saying : » Prophesy : who is it that struck you ? «
They reviled him and spoke many things against him .
The next day the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together . They included chief priests and scribes . They led him away to their council , saying :
» If you are the Christ , tell us . « But he said to them : » If I tell you , you will not believe :
and if I ask you , you will not answer . «
» Soon the Son of man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God . «
They all asked : » Are you the Son of God ? « He said to them : » You say that I am . «
They responded : » What further need do we have for witnesses ? We have heard this from his mouth . «
The whole company of them rose up and brought him before Pilate .
They accused him , saying : » We found this man perverting our nation . He forbids payment of tax to Caesar . He claims to be Christ a king . «
Pilate asked him : » Are you King of the Jews ? « He answered him : » You say it . «
Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds : » I find no fault in this man . «
They were more insistent saying : » He excites the people throughout all Judea , beginning in Galilee even to this place . «
When Pilate heard it , he asked if the man was a Galilean .
When he knew that he was from Herod’s jurisdiction , he sent him to Herod . He was in Jerusalem at that time .
Herod was very happy to see Jesus . He had wanted to see him for a long time . He hoped to see him perform a miracle .
He offered many questions but received no answers .
The chief priests and the scribes vehemently accused him .
And Herod with his soldiers despised him with contempt , and mocked him . They arrayed him in magnificent apparel . Then they sent him back to Pilate .
Herod and Pilate became friends that day . Before that time they were at enmity .
Pilate called together the chief priests , the rulers and the people .
He said : » You brought this man to me as one who perverted the people . I examined him before you and find no fault in this man . He has not done the things you accuse him of .
» Herod found no fault and sent him back to us . He has done nothing worthy of death .
» I will therefore punish him , and release him . «
He must release one prisoner to them at the feast .
They cried out in unison : » Take this man away and release to us Barabbas ! «
He was thrown into prison for insurrection sedition in the city and murder .
Pilate spoke to them again desiring to release Jesus .
But they shouted , » Impale him ! Impale him ! «
A third time he said to them : » Why , what evil has this man done ? I have found no reason to put him to death . I will therefore chastise him and release him . «
But they were insistent and spoke in loud voices asking him to impale him . And they prevailed .
Pilate pronounced a sentence that what they asked for should be done .
He released the man who was in prison for insurrection and murder and he delivered Jesus to their will .
They led him away . Simon of Cyrene was traveling from the country . They seized him and forced him to carry the stake for Jesus .
A great crowd of people followed . Many women cried and grieved over him .
Jesus turned to them and said : » Daughters of Jerusalem do not weep for me but weep for yourselves and for your children .
» The days are coming when they will say blessed are the barren those without children and the breasts that never nursed .
» Then they will say to the mountains fall on us and to the hills cover us .
» If they do these things in the green tree , what shall be done in the dry ? «
Two criminals were to be put to death with him .
They came to the place called the skull . They impaled him and the criminals , one on the right hand and the other on the left .
[ Jesus said : Father , forgive them for they do not know what they do . ] They cast lots and divided his garments among themselves .
The people stood watching while the rulers scoffed at him , saying : » He saved others let him save himself if this is his chosen , the Christ of God . «
The soldiers mocked him and offered him vinegar ,
saying : » If you are the King of the Jews save yourself . «
There was a superscription over him , THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS .
One of the criminals who were hanged complained bitterly to him saying : » Are you the Christ ? Save yourself and us . «
The other rebuked him saying : » Do you not respect God , seeing you are also condemned ?
» We are indeed justly condemned for we receive the due reward of our deeds . But this man has done nothing wrong . «
He said : » Jesus , remember me when you come in your kingdom . «
He replied : » Today I tell you this . You will be with me in paradise . «
It was about the sixth hour . Darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour .
The sun failed to shine . The veil of the temple was torn in two .
Jesus cried with a loud voice : » Father , into your hands I commend my spirit . « After saying this he quit breathing .
The centurion saw what was done and glorified God , saying : » Certainly this was a righteous man . «
The crowds gathered at this sight . When they saw the things that were done they left beating their breasts .
All of his friends and the women who followed him from Galilee stood watching from a distance .
Joseph was a member of the council and a good and righteous man .
He was from Arimathaea a city of the Jews and was looking for the kingdom of God .
He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus .
He took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth . Then he laid him in a tomb that was carved in stone . No man had ever lain in this tomb .
It was the day of the Preparation and the Sabbath was near .
The women from Galilee went with him to see the tomb and the place for the body .
They returned and prepared spices and ointments . On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment .
It was early in the morning on the first day of the week . They went to the tomb with the spices that they had prepared .
The stone was rolled away from the tomb .
When they entered they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus .
They were perplexed about what had happened . Two men stood by them in dazzling apparel .
This frightened them and they bowed down prostrate on the ground . The two men said to them : » Why do you seek the living among the dead ?
» He is not here . He has arisen ! Remember how he spoke to you when he was yet in Galilee .
» He said the Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men , be impaled , and the third day rise again . «
They remembered his words .
When they returned from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven , and to all the rest .
They were Mary Magdalene , Joanna , Mary the mother of James , and the other women with them . They told these things to the apostles .
These words seemed to be idle talk and they did not believe them .
Peter ran to the tomb . Looking inside he saw the linen cloths by themselves . He departed to his home , wondering about that which occurred .
That day two of them traveled to a village named Emmaus , about seven miles from Jerusalem .
They talked between themselves about all the things that happened .
While they talked and discussed together Jesus came near and walked with them .
But their eyes did not permit them to recognize him .
He asked : » What are you talking about with each other as you walk ? « They stopped walking and were sad .
The one named Cleopas answered him : » Do you travel alone in Jerusalem and not know the things that have happened there these days ? «
He asked : » What things ? « They said to him : » The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene . He was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people .
» The chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death . They impaled him !
» We hoped he would redeem Israel . Yes and besides all this , it is now the third day since these things happened .
» Some of the women of our company stunned us . They went to the tomb early .
» They did not find his body . They said that they had also seen a vision of angels , who said that he was alive .
» Others with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women said . He was not there ! «
He said to them : » You are foolish men . You are slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken !
» Did the Christ need to suffer these things and enter into his glory ? «
He explained to them all the Scriptures about the things concerning him . He spoke about Moses and all the prophets .
They approached the village where they were going and he appeared to be going further .
They persuaded him not to go saying , » Abide with us . It is nearly evening and the day is almost gone . « He stayed with them .
When he had sat down with them to eat he took the bread and blessed ; and breaking it he gave to them .
Their eyes were opened and they knew him . Then he vanished out of their sight .
They said to each other : » Were our hearts not burning within us ? When he spoke to us in the way and opened the scriptures to us ? «
They rose up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem . They found the eleven gathered together with others .
» The Lord has risen indeed , « they said , » and he appeared to Simon . «
And they told the things that happened in the way , how they recognized him when he broke the bread .
As they spoke these things he stood in their midst and said : » May you have peace . «
But they were afraid and supposed that they saw a spirit .
He said to them , » Why are you troubled ? And why do you question in your hearts ?
» See my hands and my feet that it is I . Touch me and see . A spirit does not have flesh and bones like I have . «
When he said this he showed them his hands and his feet .
While they still did not believe him but were filled with joy and wonder , he asked for something to eat .
They gave him a piece of a broiled fish .
He took it and ate it in front of them .
He said : » These are my words that I spoke to you , while I was yet with you . All things must be fulfilled . They are things that are written in the Law of Moses , and the Prophets , and the Psalms , concerning me . «
He opened their minds that they might understand the scriptures .
He said : » It is written that the Christ should suffer , and rise again from the dead the third day .
» Repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations , beginning from Jerusalem .
» You are witnesses of these things .
» You see I send the promise of my Father upon you . You are to wait in the city until you are clothed with power from on high . «
He led them out until they were near Bethany . Then he lifted up his hands and blessed them .
While he blessed them , he parted from them , and was carried up into heaven .
Filled with joy , they bowed down to him in adoration . Then they returned to Jerusalem .
They continued blessing God in the Temple .
In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was like God God-like .
The same was in the beginning with God .
All things were made through him and without him not one thing was made .
He lived and his life gives light to all people .
His light shines through darkness and it cannot be extinguished .
God sent a man named John .
He came to tell witness testify about the light and help people have faith .
Not being the light he came to give a witness of it .
The true light , which gives light to every man , came into the world .
The world was made through him . He was in the world and the world did not recognize him .
He came to his own . They did not receive him !
He gave the right to become children of God to all who received him . Even to those who believe in his name .
They were born from God . It was not from blood , or the will of the flesh , or the will of man .
The Word Jesus became flesh a human being and lived with us . We saw the glory of the only begotten son from the Father . He was full of loving-kindness and truth .
John spoke about him and declared : He is the one I said would come after me . He is greater than I am because he lived before me . «
Out of the fullness of his undeserved kindness he gives us one blessing after another .
The law came through Moses . Loving-kindness and truth came through Jesus Christ .
No man has ever seen God . The only begotten God-like one who is closest to the Father in the bosom of the Father tells us about him .
John gave his witness even as Jewish authorities sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem . They asked him : » Who are you ? «
He said : » I am not the Christ . «
They asked him : » Are you Elijah ? « He said : » I am not . « » Are you the prophet ? « He answered : » No . «
They said to him : » Who are you ? We need to know so we can tell the ones who sent us . «
He said : » I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness . Isaiah the prophet said : ‘ Make straight the way of Jehovah . ’ «
They were sent from the Pharisees .
They said to him : » Why do you baptize if you are not the Christ , not Elijah , and not the prophet ? «
John answered : » I baptize in water . There is one in your midst whom you do not know .
» I am not worthy to fasten his shoes . «
These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan , where John was baptizing .
The next day he saw Jesus coming to him . He boldly declared : » Behold ! The Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world ! «
» This is he whom I said would come after me . He is greater than I am because he came before me .
» I did not know him . I came baptizing in water so that everyone in Israel will come to know him . «
John said : » I saw the spirit descending as a dove out of heaven upon him .
» I did not know he was the one . God sent me to baptize in water and said : ‘ You will see one upon whom the spirit descends . The same is he who baptizes in Holy Spirit . ’
» I have seen , and have borne witness that this is the Son of God . «
The next day John was standing with two of his disciples .
He looked at Jesus as he walked , and said : » Behold , the Lamb of God ! «
The two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus .
Jesus turned and saw them following . He asked them , » What are you after ? They asked him : » Teacher , where are you staying ? «
He said « » Come and see . « So they came to where he was staying . They stayed with him that day . It was about the tenth hour .
One of the two , who heard John speak and followed him , was Andrew , Simon Peter’s brother .
He found his brother Simon first . He said to him : » We have found the Messiah Christ . «
He took him to Jesus . Jesus looked at him , and said : » You are Simon the son of John : you will be called Cephas meaning : Peter . «
The next day he was reminded to go into Galilee . There he found Philip . Jesus said to him , » Follow me . «
Philip was from Bethsaida , of the city of Andrew and Peter .
Philip found Nathanael , and said to him : » We have found the person Moses and the prophets wrote about in the Law and God’s word . It is Jesus of Nazareth , the son of Joseph . «
And Nathanael said to him : » Could any good thing come out of Nazareth ? « Philip said : » Come and see . «
Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him . He said : » Look an Israelite indeed . There is no deceit in him ! «
Nathanael asked : » How do you know me ? « Jesus answered : » I saw you under the fig tree before Philip called you . «
Nathanael answered : » Rabbi you are the Son of God . You are King of Israel . «
Jesus responded : » I told you I saw you under the fig tree . Is this why you believe ? You will see greater things than these . «
Jesus continued : » You will see the heavens opened and you will see the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man . «
There was a marriage in Cana of Galilee on the third day . The mother of Jesus was there .
Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the marriage feast .
They ran out of wine . So the mother of Jesus said to him : » They have no wine . «
Jesus said to her : » Woman what have I to do with you ? My hour has not arrived . «
His mother told the servants to do whatever he says .
Six stone water jars were placed there to honor purification rules of the Jews . Each contained more than twenty gallons .
Jesus said to them : » Fill the jars with water . « They filled them to the brim .
» Draw some out , « he said , » and take it to the master of the feast . « So they drew some out .
The master of the feast did not know about the water turned into wine . He tasted it and called the bridegroom .
He said to him : » Every man sets out the good wine first . When the men have drunk freely the lower quality wine is served . You have kept the good wine until now . «
This was the first miracle Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee . It gave evidence of his glory and his disciples believed in him .
He , his mother , brothers and disciples traveled to Capernaum . They stayed there many days .
The Passover of the Jews was at hand and Jesus went to Jerusalem .
He found the merchants who sold oxen , sheep and doves . The moneychangers were sitting nearby .
He made a whip of cords , and chased them all out of the temple , including the sheep and the oxen . He poured out the coins of the moneychangers and overturned the tables .
He told those who sold doves : » Take these things away . Do not make my Father’s house a house of merchandise . «
His disciples remembered what was written . ‘ Zeal for your house shall eat me up . ’
The Jews asked him : » What sign would you show us seeing that you do these things ?
Jesus replied : » Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up . «
The Jews responded : » It took forty-six years to build this temple and you will raise it up in three days ? «
But he spoke of the temple of his body .
When he was raised from the dead his disciples remembered that he said this . Then they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus said .
When he was in Jerusalem at the Passover feast , many saw the signs he did and expressed active faith in his name .
Jesus did not trust his security to them for he understood all men .
He did not need evidence about men for he knew what was in man .
Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus , a ruler of the Jews .
He came to Jesus by night , and said to him : » Rabbi ! We know you are a teacher from God . No one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him . «
Jesus answered : » Truly I tell you unless a person is born again brought forth from above he cannot see the kingdom of God . «
Nicodemus asked : » How could a man be born when he is old ? Can he enter his mother’s womb again and be born ? «
Jesus responded : » I tell you truth , except a man be born of water and the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God !
» That which is born from the flesh is flesh and that which is born from the Spirit is spirit .
» Do not marvel that I say you must be born again .
» The wind blows where it will . You hear the sound of it . Yet you do not know where it comes from or where it goes . It is like this with every one who is born from the Spirit . «
Nicodemus asked : » How can these things be ? «
Jesus answered : » Are you a teacher of Israel and you do not understand these things ?
» This is the truth . We speak what we know and witness about what we have seen . But you do not receive our testimony .
» If I told you earthly things and you did not have faith , how will you have faith if I tell you heavenly things ?
» No one has ever ascended into heaven but the Son of man who descended from heaven .
» As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , so the Son of man must also be lifted up .
» Everyone who has an active faith in him may have everlasting life .
» For God loved the world so much , that he gave his only begotten Son , that whoever has an active faith in him should not perish , but have everlasting life .
» God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world . Instead the world should be saved through him .
» He who has an active faith in him is not judged . He who does not have an active faith has been judged already for he has not had faith in the name of the only begotten Son of God .
» This is the judgment , that the light has come into the world . People loved the darkness rather than the light for their works were evil .
» Every one who does evil hates the light . He does not come to the light because his works would be reproved .
» He who practices the truth comes to the light . His works are made known that they are from God . «
After these things Jesus and his disciples traveled to the land of Judea where he stayed with them and baptized .
John was also baptizing in Aenon near to Salim , because there was much water there . People came and were baptized .
John had not yet been thrown into prison .
There was a controversy between some of John’s disciples and the Jews about purification .
They went to John and said : » Rabbi , he who was with you beyond the Jordan , the one about whom you witnessed , he and the men with him baptize . «
John answered : » A man can receive nothing unless it is given to him from heaven .
» You bear witness that I said I am not the Christ . I have been sent before him .
» He that has the bride is the bridegroom . The friend of the bridegroom stands and listens to him . He rejoices greatly because he hears the bridegroom’s voice . This fills me with joy .
» He must increase and I must decrease . «
» He who comes from above is above all . He who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks from an earthly viewpoint . He who comes from heaven is superior .
» He testifies about what he has seen and heard , but no man accepts his testimony .
» He who receives his testimony confirms by his seal that God is true .
» For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God . God does not give the spirit by measure .
» The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand .
» He who puts active faith in the Son has everlasting life . He who disobeys the Son will not see life for the wrath of God remains upon him . « Greek : apeitheo : willfully disobey , not having faith
The Lord was aware that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John .
Actually Jesus did not baptize . His disciples baptized .
He left Judea , and departed again into Galilee .
He needed to travel through Samaria .
He arrived at a city of Samaria called Sychar . It is near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph .
Jacob’s well was there . It was about the sixth hour when Jesus arrived . Being weary from the journey he sat down by the well .
A woman of Samaria came to draw water . Jesus said to her : » Please give me a drink . «
His disciples went away to the city to buy meat .
The woman of Samaria asked : » How is it that you being a Jew ask for a drink from me ? I am a woman of Samaria . « The Jews did not associate with Samaritans . Not in early manuscripts .
Jesus answered : » If you know the gift of God and who asked you for a drink , you would have asked him to give you living water . «
The woman said to him : » Sir , you do not have anything with which to draw water and the well is deep . Where do you get that living water ?
» Are you greater than our father Jacob ? He gave us the well . He and his children and cattle drank from it . «
Jesus answered : » Whoever drinks from this water will thirst again .
» But whoever drinks from the water that I give him will never thirst . The water that I will give him will be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life . «
The woman said to him : » Sir , give me this water ! That way I will not thirst and not come here to draw . «
Jesus said to her : » Go call your husband and come here . «
The woman answered : » I have no husband . « Jesus replied to her : » You said well , » I have no husband . «
» For you have had five husbands . The one you have now is not your husband , this is true . «
The woman said to him : » Sir , I perceive that you are a prophet .
» Our fathers worshipped in this mountain . But you say Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship . «
Jesus replied : » Woman believe me . The hour comes when you will worship the Father neither in the mountain nor in Jerusalem .
» You worship what you do not know . We worship what we know . Salvation is from the Jews .
» But the hour comes and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the Father with spirit and truth . The Father seeks such people to worship him .
» God is a Spirit . They who worship him must worship him with spirit and truth . «
The woman responded : » I know that Christ the Messiah is coming . When he comes he will tell us all things . «
Jesus said : » I that speak to you am he . «
His disciples came and wondered why he talked with the woman . Yet no one asked : » What are you looking for ? Why did you talk to her ? «
The woman left her water pot and went to the city . She spoke to the men .
» Come see a man who told me everything I have ever done . Could this be the Christ ? «
They left the city to see him .
In the meantime his disciples urged him to eat .
He said : » I have food to eat that you do not know about . «
So the disciples said to each other : » Has any man brought him something to eat ? «
Jesus said : » My food is to do the will of him that sent me . To finish his work !
» Do you say there are four months until the harvest comes ? I say to you lift up your eyes and look on the fields . They are already white for harvest .
» He who reaps receives wages , and gathers fruit for life eternal . Both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together .
» That saying is true . One sows and another reaps .
» I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor . Other men labored and you entered into their labors . «
Many Samaritans of that city put faith believed in him because of what the woman said : » He told me everything I have ever done . «
When the Samaritans came to him they urged him to stay with them . So he stayed there two days .
Many more believed because of the words he spoke .
They told the woman : » We believe because of what you said and we heard him ourselves . We know that this is indeed the Christ , the Savior of the world ! «
After two days he departed from there and went to Galilee .
Jesus testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country .
The Galileans welcomed him . They saw all the things he did at the feast in Jerusalem for they were at the feast .
Jesus returned to Cana of Galilee where he turned the water into wine . There was a nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum .
He heard that Jesus came from Judea into Galilee . He went to him and urged him to come see his son . His son was near death .
» Until you see signs and wonders you will not believe , « Jesus said .
The nobleman said : » Sir , come or my child would die . «
Jesus replied : » Go your way . Your son lives ! « The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him , and he went his way .
His servants met him as he returned and said : » Your son is alive ! «
He asked them about the hour he was healed . They said : » Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him . «
The father knew that it was the same hour in which Jesus said : » Your son lives . « He and his entire household believed .
This is the second miracle that Jesus did when he came out of Judea into Galilee .
After this the Jews had a Festival holy day , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
There is a pool by the sheep-market gate at Jerusalem . It is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethzatha . It has five porches colonnades .
In these lay a great crowd of sick people , of blind and lame waiting for the water to bubble up .
A man who had an infirmity for thirty-eight years was present .
Jesus saw him lying there . He knew that he had been sick for a long time . So he asked him : » Do you want to get well ? «
The sick man replied : » I have no man to put me in the pool when the water is stirred . Others step down before I can go . «
Jesus said : » Arise pick up your bed and walk . «
Immediately the man was made whole . He picked up his bed and walked . It happened on the Sabbath day .
So the Jews told the man who was cured : » It is not lawful for you to pickup your bed for it is the Sabbath . «
He answered : » He who made me whole told me to pick up my bed and walk . «
» Who is the man , « they asked , » that said to you pick up your bed and walk ? «
He did not know who healed him for Jesus quietly left the crowd .
Later Jesus found him in the temple and told him : » Now that you are healed do not sin anymore and avoid worse things happening to you . «
The man went away and told the Jews Jesus made him whole .
The Jews persecuted Jesus because he did these things on the Sabbath .
Jesus responded to them : » My Father works until now and I work . «
The Jews intensified their efforts to kill him for these reasons : he broke the Sabbath and he also called God his own Father , making himself equal with God .
Jesus answered them : » Truly I tell you the Son can do nothing by himself . He sees the Father do something and then he does it . Whatever the Father does the Son does in like manner .
» The Father loves the Son . He shows him all of the things he does . He will show him greater works than these . And you will marvel .
» The Father raises the dead and gives them life . The Son also gives life to those he wills .
» The Father does not judge any man for he has given all judgment to the Son .
» All may honor the Son , even as they honor the Father . He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father that sent him .
» Truly , Truly I say to you , he who hears my word , and believes him that sent me , has everlasting life . He will not receive judgment for he has passed out of death into life .
» Truly I tell you , the hour is coming when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear listen understand will live .
» The Son has life in himself just as the Father has life in himself . For the Father gave him life .
» And he gave him authority to execute judgment , because he is the Son of man .
» Do not wonder about this for the hour is coming when everyone in the grave will hear his voice .
» They will return . Those who did good will have the resurrection of life . Those who did evil will receive the resurrection of judgment .
» I can do nothing by myself . So I hear and judge and my judgment is righteous . I do not seek my own will , but the will of him that sent me .
» If I alone testify about myself , my testimony is not enough truth .
» There is another who testifies about me . I know that his evidence about me is true .
» You sent people to John the Baptist and he has witnessed about the truth .
» The testimony I receive is not from man . However I say these things that you may be saved .
» He was the lamp that burns and shines . You were willing to rejoice for a season in his light .
» The testimony I have is greater than that of John . The works I do are the works the Father gave me to accomplish . They testify that the Father has sent me .
» The Father who sent me testifies about me . You have not heard his voice nor seen him at any time .
» You do not have his word dwelling in you . This is because you do not believe in the person he has sent .
» You search investigate study the Scriptures because you think that in them you have everlasting life . These Scriptures testify about me .
» And yet you will not come to me that you may have life .
» I do not accept glory from men .
» I know that the love of God is not in you .
» I came in my Father’s name and you did not receive me . If another came in his own name you would receive him .
» How can you believe ? You seek praise and glory from one another ? Why do you not seek the glory that comes from the only God ?
» Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father . Moses on whom you have set your hope is a plaintiff against you .
» It is a fact ! If you believed Moses you would believe me . He wrote about me !
» If you do not believe his writings how will you believe my words ? «
After this Jesus went to the other side of the Sea of Galilee , which is the sea of Tiberias .
A great crowd followed him because they saw the signs miracles he performed on the sick .
Jesus and his disciples went to the mountain .
It was time for the Passover feast of the Jews .
Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming to him . He asked Philip : » Where will we buy enough bread to feed them ? «
He said this to test him for he knew what he would do .
Philip answered : » Two hundred shillings’ worth of bread is not sufficient for everyone to take a little . «
Andrew , Simon Peter’s brother , one of his disciples said :
» There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two fish . What are these among so many ? «
Jesus said : » Make the people sit down . « There were about five thousand men who sat down on the grass .
Jesus gave thanks and then he distributed the loaves along with the fish to those sitting on the grass .
When they were filled he told the disciples to gather up the broken pieces left over so nothing would be wasted .
They gathered twelve baskets of leftovers after everyone had eaten .
When the people saw the miracle performed they said : » Truly this is the prophet who came into the world . «
Jesus knew that they were about to take him by force and make him king . So he withdrew again to the mountain by himself .
That evening his disciples went to the sea .
They boarded a boat to travel over the sea to Capernaum . It was dark and Jesus had not yet come to them .
A great wind made the sea rise .
They rowed about four miles and saw Jesus walking on the sea . He came close to the boat . They were afraid .
He said to them : » It is I . Do not be afraid ! «
They eagerly brought him into the boat . The boat soon arrived at the land where they were going .
The next day the crowd stood by the side of the sea . Jesus entered the only boat while his disciples went away alone .
Small boats from Tiberias came there to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord gave thanks .
When the crowd saw that Jesus and his disciples were not there they got into the boats and traveled to Capernaum seeking Jesus .
They found him on the other side of the sea and said : » Rabbi Teacher when did you come here ? «
Jesus said : » Truly I tell you , you seek me not because you saw miracles but because you ate of the loaves and were full .
» Do not work for food that perishes but for food that offers everlasting life . The Son of man will give you this food . The Father , even God , has set his seal upon him . «
They asked : » What must we do , that we may work the works of God ? «
Jesus answered : » This is the work of God , that you have an active faith in the one whom he has sent . «
They asked : » What do you offer for a sign miracle that we may see and believe you ? What work will you do ?
» Our fathers ate manna in the wilderness . It is written , ‘ He gave them bread out of heaven to eat . ’ «
Jesus responded : » I speak the truth ! It was not Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven . My Father gives you the true bread out of heaven .
» For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven . It gives life to the world . «
They responded : » Lord , always give us this bread . «
Jesus replied : » I am the bread of life . He who comes to me will not hunger . The one who puts active faith in me will never thirst .
» I told you . You have seen me and yet do not believe .
» That which the Father gives me will come to me . I will not reject him who comes to me .
» I do not do my own will . I came down from heaven to do the will of him that sent me .
» This is the will of him that sent me that I should not lose any of those he has given me , but I should raise them up at the last day .
» For this is the will of my Father . Every one who sees the Son and puts active faith in him will have everlasting life , and I will raise him up at the last day . «
The Jews complained about him . This is because he said ‘ I am the bread that came down out of heaven . ’
They said : » Is Jesus the son of Joseph ? We know his father and mother . How does he now say , I came down out of heaven ? «
Jesus answered : » Stop complaining and saying things against me .
» No man can come to me unless the Father , who sent me , draws him . I will resurrect him raise him up in the last day .
» It is written in the prophets : Jehovah shall teach them all . Every one who hears the Father and has learned comes to me .
» No one has seen the Father . Only he who is from God , He has seen the Father .
» Truly , truly I tell you , he who believes has everlasting life .
» I am the bread of life .
» Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and they died .
» This is the bread that comes down out of heaven that a man may eat of it and not die .
» I am the living bread that came down out of heaven . If any man eats of this bread he will live forever . Yes and the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world . «
The Jews argued with one another saying : » How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? «
Jesus responded to them : » Truly I tell you if you do not eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood you will not have life in yourselves .
» He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life ! I will raise him up at the last day .
» For my flesh is meat indeed , and my blood is drink indeed .
» He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides with me , and I with him .
» The living Father sent me and I live because of the Father . He who takes me for his food will live because of me .
» This is the bread that came down out of heaven . It is not like the bread manna the fathers ate and then died . He who eats this bread will live forever . «
He said these things in the synagogue when he taught in Capernaum .
When they heard this many of his disciples said : » This is a hard saying ; who can listen to it ? «
He knew his disciples complained about this . Jesus said : » Does this cause you to stumble ?
» What if you see the Son of man ascending where he was before ?
» It is the spirit that gives life . The flesh profits nothing . The words that I spoke to you are spirit and life .
» There are some of you who do not believe . « Jesus knew from the beginning whom they were who did not believe and who would betray him .
He stated : » For this reason listen to what I say . No man can come to me , except it be given to him from the Father . «
After this many of his disciples returned to their old ways . They did not walk with him anymore .
Jesus asked the twelve : » Will you also go away ? «
Simon Peter answered him : » Lord , to whom shall we go ? You have the words of everlasting life !
» We believe and know that you are the Holy One of God . «
Jesus replied : » Did I not choose you , the twelve ? And yet one of you is a devil false accuser slanderer demon « .
He spoke of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot one of the twelve , for he would betray him .
After that Jesus walked in Galilee . He would not walk in Judea because the Jews looked for ways to kill him .
It was time for the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles .
His brothers said to him : » Leave here and go to Judea . That way your disciples also may see the works that you do .
» No one does anything in secret when he seeks to be known publicly . If you do these things , show yourself to the world . «
For his brothers did not express active faith in him .
Then Jesus replied : » My time is not yet here but your time is always ready .
» The world has no reason to hate you . But it hates me because I testify that its works are evil .
» You go to this feast . I will not go to this feast for my time has not yet come . «
When he said these words to them he stayed in Galilee .
When his brothers left he secretly went to the feast .
The Jews looked for him at the feast and they said : » Where is he ? «
There was much whispering among the people concerning him . Some said : » He is a good man . « Others said : » No , he deceives the people . «
However no man spoke openly about him out of fear of the Jews .
Midway through the feast Jesus went to the temple and taught .
The Jews wondered saying : » How does this man know letters ? He has had no formal education . «
Jesus replied : » My teaching is not my own . It is his who sent me .
» If any man does his will he shall know the teachings . He will know if it is from God , or whether I speak from myself .
» He who speaks from his own authority seeks his own glory . He who seeks glory for the one who sent him is true . Unrighteousness is not found in him .
» Did Moses give you the law ? Yet none of you obey the law ! Why do you seek to kill me ? «
The crowd answered : » You have a demon ! Who seeks to kill you ? «
Jesus responded : » I did one work and you all marveled because of it .
» Moses gave you circumcision . Not that it is of Moses , but of the fathers . And you circumcise a man on the Sabbath .
» A man receives circumcision on the Sabbath . That way the Law of Moses may not be broken . Are you angry with me , because I made an entire man whole on the Sabbath ?
» Do not judge according to appearance ! Judge a righteous judgment . «
Some in Jerusalem asked : » Is this he whom they seek to kill ?
» He spoke openly and they said nothing to him . Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ ?
» How is it we know where this man is from but when the Christ comes no one will know where he is from ? «
Jesus shouted in the temple : » You know me and from where I came . I did not come on my own . He who sent me is true and you do not know him .
» I know him because I am from him and he sent me . «
They looked for a way to capture him . But no man laid his hand on him . This is because his hour had not yet arrived .
Many in the crowd believed in him . They asked : » When the Christ comes will he do more signs than those this man has done ? «
The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering these things concerning him . The chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to capture him .
Jesus therefore said : » I am with you a little while . Then I go to him who sent me .
» You will seek me and will not find me . You cannot come where I am going . «
The Jews said among themselves : » Where will this man go that we shall not find him ? Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks , and teach the Greeks ?
» What is this word that he said : ‘ You will seek me , and will not find me ; and you cannot come where I am going ? ’ «
On the last day , the great day of the feast , Jesus stood and shouted in a loud voice : » If any man thirst let him come to me and drink .
» Rivers of living water will flow from the innermost being of the man who believes in me . This is according to the scriptures . «
He spoke this by the Spirit . Those who believed in him were to receive the Spirit . The Spirit was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified .
When they heard these words some of the crowd proclaimed : » This truly is the prophet !
Others said : » This is the Christ . « But some asked : » Does the Christ come out of Galilee ?
» Do the Scriptures say that the Christ comes from the seed of David and from Bethlehem , the village where David was ? «
So there arose a division in the crowd because of him .
Some of them wanted to apprehend him . Yet no man laid hands on him .
The chief priests and Pharisees asked the officers : » Why did you not bring him ? «
» No man has ever spoken the way he speaks , « they replied .
The Pharisees therefore answered them : » Are you also deceived ?
» Have any of the rulers or the Pharisees believed in him ?
» This crowd does not know the law . It is contemptible «
Nicodemus spoke to them . He is the Pharisee who earlier went to Jesus .
» Does our law convict a man without first hearing from him to find out what he has done ? «
They replied : » Are you also from Galilee ? Search , and see that no prophet comes out of Galilee . «
Again Jesus spoke to them , saying : » I am the light of the world . He that follows me will not walk in the darkness , but will have the light of life . «
The Pharisees therefore replied to him : » You testify about yourself . Your evidence is not true ! «
Jesus answered them : » Even if I bear witness about myself , my testimony is true ! I know where I came from and I know where I am going . You do not know where I came from or where I am going .
» You judge according to the flesh . I judge no one .
» Yes and if I judge my judgment is true . I am not alone for I am with the Father who sent me .
» It is written in your law that the witness of two men is true .
» I testify about myself and the Father who sent me testifies about me . «
They said : » Where is your Father ? « Jesus answered : » You do not know me , nor do you know my Father ! If you knew me you would also know my Father . «
He spoke these words at the treasury as he taught in the temple . No one tried to arrest him because his hour had not yet arrived .
He said : » I go away . You will seek me and will die in your sin . You cannot come where I go . «
The Jews asked : » Would he kill himself ? For he said you could not come where I go . «
He responded to them : » You are from below . I am from above . You are from this world . I am not from this world .
» I said to you that you would die in your sins . Unless you believe that I am he , you will die in your sins ! «
» Who are you , « they asked . Jesus replied : » What have I been telling you from the beginning ?
» I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you . He that sent me is true . I tell the world the things he told me . «
They were not aware that he spoke to them about the Father .
Jesus said : » When you have lifted up impaled the Son of man you will know that I am that person . I do nothing by myself ! I speak what the Father taught me !
» He sent me and is with me . He has not left me alone . I always do the things that are pleasing to him ! «
Many believed when he said these things .
Jesus told the Jews who believed him : » If you dwell in my word you truly are my disciples .
» You will know the truth and the truth will make you free ! «
They answered him : » We are Abraham’s seed , and have never been in bondage to any man . How can you say we will be made free ? «
Jesus answered : » Truly I tell you every one who commits sin is a slave of sin .
» The slave does not abide in the house forever . The son abides forever .
» If therefore the Son will make you free , you will be free indeed .
» I know that you are Abraham’s seed . Yet you seek to kill me . That is because my word has no place among you .
» I speak the things that I have seen and heard when I was with my Father . You also do the things that you heard from your father . «
They answered : » Our father is Abraham . « Jesus replied : » If you were Abraham’s children , you would do the works of Abraham .
» You seek to kill me . I told you the truth ! I heard it from God . Abraham did not do this .
» You do the works of your father . « They said : » We were not born of fornication . We have one Father , God ! «
Jesus said : » If God were your Father you would love me . I came from God ! I have not come from myself . He sent me !
» Why do you not understand what I say ? Can you not hear me ?
» You are from your father Satan the Devil slanderer false accuser ! You want to do the desires of your father . He was a murderer from the beginning . He does not stand for the truth . There is no truth in him . When he speaks a lie , he speaks his own lies . He is a liar and the father of the lie !
» I tell you the truth and you do not believe me .
» Which of you convicted me of sin ? If I speak truth , why do you not believe me ?
» He that is of God hears the words of God . That is why you do not listen . You are not from God ! «
The Jews answered : » Do we not speak correctly that you are a Samaritan and have a demon ? «
Jesus answered : » I have no demon . I honor my Father and you dishonor me .
» I do not seek my own glory . There is one that seeks and judges .
» Truly I tell you if a man obeys my word he will never see death . «
The Jews said to him : » Now we know that you have a demon . Abraham and the prophets died . And you say if a man obeys my word he will never taste of death .
» Are you greater than our father Abraham ? He died ! The prophets also died . Who do you make yourself out to be ? «
Jesus answered : » If I glorify myself , my glory is nothing . My Father glorifies me . He is the one whom you say is your God .
» You do not know him . I know him . If I say I do not know him I would be like you , a liar ! But I know him and obey his word .
» Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day . He saw it and was glad . «
The Jews replied : » You are not yet fifty years old . Have you seen Abraham ? «
Jesus said : » I tell you the truth , I existed before Abraham was born ! «
They took up stones to throw at him . But Jesus hid himself and left the temple .
He saw a man who was blind from birth .
His disciples asked him : » Rabbi he was born blind . Who sinned , this man or his parents ? «
Jesus answered : » This man did not sin . Neither did his parents sin . The works of God should be made known in him .
» We must work the works of him that sent me while it is day . When the night comes no man can work .
» When I am in the world , I am the light of the world . «
He spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle . Then he anointed the eyes of the blind with the clay .
He told him : » Go wash in the pool of Siloam . « He went there and washed . And he could see !
The neighbors saw him afterwards . They knew he was a blind beggar . So they asked : Is this he who sat and begged ?
Others said : » It is he . « Yet others said : » No , but he is like him . « He said : » I am he ! «
How were your eyes opened ? They asked .
He answered : » The man that is called Jesus made clay , and anointed my eyes . Then he told me to go to Siloam and wash . I went there and washed , and I received sight . «
They inquired asked : » Where is he ? « He responded : » I do not know . «
They brought the former blind man to the Pharisees .
Jesus healed the blind man on the Sabbath day .
The Pharisees asked him how he received his sight . He said to them : « He put clay on my eyes , I washed and now I see . «
Some of the Pharisees said : » This man is not from God , because he does not keep the Sabbath . « Others said : » How could a man that is a sinner perform such signs ? « There was division among them .
They spoke again to the former blind man . » What do you say about him ? « He said : » He is a prophet . «
The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and then received his sight . So they called his parents .
They asked the parents : » Is this your son ? Was he born blind ? How does he see now ? «
His parents answered : » This is our son and he was born blind .
» We do not know how he now sees or who opened his eyes . Ask him . He is of age and he will speak for himself . «
The parents said these things because they feared the Jews . The Jews had agreed that if any man should confess him to be Christ , he should be put out of the synagogue .
So the parents said : » Ask him , he is of age . «
So they called the man that was blind a second time , and said to him : » Give glory to God . We know that this man is a sinner . «
He answered : » I do not know if he is a sinner . One thing I know , I was blind and now I see . «
They asked : » What did he do to you ? How did he open your eyes ?
He answered them : » I told you before and you did not listen . Why do you want to hear it again ? Would you also become his disciples ? «
Then they spoke abusively to him : » You are his disciple ! We are disciples of Moses . «
We know that God spoke to Moses . As for this man we do not know where he is from .
The man answered : » This certainly is a marvel that you do not know where he is from and yet he opened my eyes . «
» We know that God does not listen to sinners . If any man respects God and does his will , God listens to him .
» Since the world began no one ever heard of a man opening the eyes of someone born blind .
» If this man were not from God , he could do nothing .
They answered : » You were born in sin and you teach us ? « Then they threw him out .
Jesus heard that they threw him out . He found him and said : » Do you believe in the Son of God ? «
He answered : » Who is he Lord that I may believe in him ? «
Jesus replied : » You both see and hear him for he speaks with you . «
» Lord I believe , « he said . And he bowed down to him .
Jesus said : » I came into the world for this judgment that those not seeing may see and those seeing may become blind . «
Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things , and said to him : » Are we also blind ? «
Jesus replied : » If you were blind you would have no sin . But you say we see so your sin remains . «
» Truly I tell you , he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs up some other way is a thief and a robber .
» He who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
» The doorkeeper opens to him and the sheep hear his voice . He calls his sheep by name and leads them .
» When all of his own are out he leads them . The sheep follow him for they know his voice .
» They will not follow a stranger but will flee from him . They do not know the voice of a stranger . «
They did not understand this illustration Jesus spoke to them .
Jesus explained : » I am the door of the sheep .
» Thieves and robbers came in place of me but the sheep did not listen to them .
» I am the door . If any man enters through me he will be saved . He will go in and out and find pasture .
» The thief comes to steal , and kill , and destroy . I came that they may have life , and may have it abundantly .
» I am the good shepherd . The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep .
» The hired man owns no sheep . He is not the shepherd . He sees the wolf coming and abandons the sheep . The wolf snatches them , and scatters them .
» He leaves because he is a hired man and does not care for the sheep .
» I am the good shepherd . I know my own , and my own know me .
Just as the Father knows me I know the Father ! I lay down my life for the sheep .
» I have other sheep that are not of this fold . I will also bring them . They will hear my voice and they will become one flock , one shepherd .
» The Father loves me . Therefore I lay down my life and I take it back again .
» No one takes it away from me , but I lay it down voluntarily . I have authority jurisdiction right to lay it down , and I have authority to take it again . I have received this commandment from my Father . «
The Jews were again divided because of what Jesus said .
Many of them said : » He has a demon and is mad . Why listen to him ? «
Others said : » These are not the sayings of one possessed with a demon . Can a demon open the eyes of the blind ? «
It was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem .
It was wintertime . Jesus was walking in the temple on Solomon’s porch the Colonnade of Solomon .
The Jews came to him and asked : » How long will you keep us in suspense ? If you are the Christ , tell us plainly . «
Jesus replied : » I told you and you do not believe . The works that I do in my Father’s name bear witness of me .
» You do not believe because you are not my sheep !
» My sheep hear my voice . I know them and they follow me .
» I give them eternal life . They will never perish . No one will snatch them out of my hand .
» My Father has given them to me . He is greater than all and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand .
» The Father and I are one united in purpose . «
The Jews picked up stones again to stone him .
Jesus replied to them : » I have shown you many good works from the Father . For which of those works do you stone me ? «
The Jews answered him : » We do not stone you for good work but for blasphemy . You are a man and you make yourself like God . «
Jesus said : » Is it not written in your law , I said , you are ‘ god-like ones ’ ?
» So if he called them ‘ god-like ones , ’ ’ those to whom the word of God came , and the Scriptures may not be annulled ,
» do you say to the one whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world , you blaspheme ? And this because I said , I am the Son of God .
» If I am not doing the works of my Father , do not believe me .
» But if I do them and you do not believe me , believe the works ! That way you may know and understand that the Father is with me , and I am with the Father . «
They tried again to capture him but he escaped from them .
He traveled beyond the Jordan into the place where John first baptized and stayed there .
Many came to him and they said : » John indeed did not perform a single miracle . Yet everything John said about this man was true . «
Many believed in him there .
A man named Lazarus was sick . He lived at Bethany where his sisters Mary and Martha lived .
This is the same Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment , and wiped his feet with her hair . It was her brother Lazarus who was sick .
The sisters therefore sent for the Lord , They said : » The one for whom you have great affection is sick . «
When Jesus heard it he said : » This sickness will not end in death . It is for the glory of God , that the Son of God may be glorified by it . «
Jesus loved Martha , and her sister , and Lazarus .
When he heard the news he stayed where he was for two days .
After this he said to the disciples : » Let us go to Judea again . «
The disciples said : » Rabbi , the Jews were seeking to stone you and you go there ? «
Jesus answered : » Are there not twelve hours in the day ? If a man walks in the day he does not stumble because he sees the light of this world .
» But if a man walk in the night , he stumbles , because the light is not in him . «
Then he told them : » Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep . I go to wake him out of sleep . «
The disciples said , » Lord , if he has fallen asleep , he would recover . «
Jesus spoke of his death . They thought he spoke of taking rest in sleep .
Then Jesus said plainly : » Lazarus is dead ! «
» I am glad for your sakes that I was not there , for it will help you believe . Let us go to him . «
Thomas , who is called Didymus , said to his fellow disciples : » Let us also go that we may die with him . «
When Jesus arrived he found Lazarus had been in the grave four days .
Now Bethany was near Jerusalem , about two miles away .
Many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary , to console them about their brother .
Martha went out to meet Jesus and Mary sat in the house .
Martha said to Jesus : » Lord if you had been here my brother would not have died .
» Even now I know that what ever you ask of God he will give it to you . «
Jesus replied : » Your brother will rise again . «
Martha exclaimed : » I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day . «
Jesus said : » I am the resurrection and the life . He who puts active faith in me will live , even if he dies .
» Whoever lives and puts active faith in me will never die . Do you believe this ? «
She said : » Yes Lord , I believe that you are the Christ , the Son of God who is to come into the world . «
After she said this she went away and secretly called her sister Mary . She said : » The teacher is here and calls you . «
Mary got up quickly and went to him .
( Now Jesus had not yet arrived at the village and was still at the place where Martha met him . )
The Jews were with her in the house , consoling her . They saw Mary get up quickly and leave . So they followed her , supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there .
When Mary saw Jesus she fell down at his feet . She said : » Lord ; if you had been here my brother would not have died . «
Jesus groaned in his spirit and was troubled when he saw her weeping and the Jews who came with her weeping .
He asked : » Where have you laid him ? « They answered : » Come and see Lord . «
Jesus wept .
The Jews therefore said : » Look how deeply he loved him ! «
Some of them said : » This man opened the eyes of the blind . Could he have prevented this man from dying ? «
Again Jesus groaned in himself . He went to the tomb . It was a cave with a stone laid against it .
Jesus said : » Take away the stone . « Martha , the sister of the dead man said : » Lord by now the body has decayed for he has been dead four days . «
Jesus said to her : » Did I not say that if you believe you shall see the glory of God ? «
So they took away the stone . Jesus lifted up his eyes , and said : » Father , I thank you that you hear me .
» I knew that you always hear me . But because of the crowd that stands here I said it , that they may believe that you did send me . «
After he finished he cried out loud : » Lazarus , come out ! «
He that was dead came out . He was bound hand and foot with grave-clothes and his face was bound about with a napkin . Jesus commanded them : » Unwrap him and let him go . «
Many of the Jews , who came to Mary and saw what he did , believed in him .
Some of them went to the Pharisees and told them the things that Jesus had done .
The chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council . They asked what they should do . » This man does many signs and miracles .
» If we let him alone all men will believe in him . Then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation . «
Caiaphas the high priest that year said to them : » You know nothing at all .
» You do not understand that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people . That way the whole nation will not perish . «
He did not say this from his own understanding . As high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation .
He would die for the nation . He would also gather together the children of God that are scattered abroad .
So from that day forth they took counsel that they might put him to death .
Jesus did not walk openly among the Jews anymore . He departed into the wilderness of the nearby country . He and his disciples stayed at a city called Ephraim .
It was the Jewish Passover . Many went out of the country to Jerusalem to purify themselves before the Passover .
They searched for Jesus . They stood in the temple speaking to one another : » What do you think ? Will he come to the feast ? «
Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that , if any man knew where he was , he should report it that they might seize him .
Six days before the Passover Jesus traveled to Bethany . This was where Lazarus lived . He was the man Jesus raised from the dead .
Jesus ate supper there . He and Lazarus sat at the meal while Martha served .
Mary took a pound of very precious ointment of pure nard and anointed the feet of Jesus . She wiped his feet with her hair . The house was filled with the odor of the ointment .
Judas Iscariot , the disciple who would betray him said :
» Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred danarii , and given to the poor ? «
He did not say this because he cared for the poor . He was a thief . He had the moneybox and took away what was put in it .
Jesus therefore replied : » Let her alone that she may preserve it for the day of my burial .
» You always have the poor with you , but you do not always have me . «
The common people of the Jews learned that he was there . So they came to see Jesus and Lazarus , whom he raised from the dead .
The chief priests took counsel that they might put Lazarus also to death .
This is because by reason of Lazarus many of the Jews believed in Jesus .
The next day a great crowd came to the feast . They heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem .
They took palm branches and met him . They cried out , » Hosanna : Blessed is he who comes in the name of Jehovah , even the King of Israel ! «
Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it just as it is written :
» Do not fear daughter of Zion . Behold , your King comes sitting on a donkey’s colt . «
His disciples did not understand these things at first . However when Jesus was glorified they remembered the things that were written about him . They also remembered the things that had been done to him .
The crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb , and raised him from the dead , gave witness .
For this reason also the crowd met him , for they heard that he had performed this miracle .
The Pharisees spoke among themselves : » You see that you are not accomplishing anything . Look the world has gone after him . «
Now there were Greeks among those who went up to worship at the feast .
They approached Philip , who was of Bethsaida of Galilee , and told him : » We wish to see Jesus . «
Philip and Andrew told Jesus .
Jesus answered : » The time has come for the Son of man to be glorified .
» Truly I tell you unless a grain of wheat falls to the earth and dies , it remains alone ; but if it dies it bears much fruit .
» He that loves his life in this world loses it ; and he that detests does not love his life in this world shall save it for everlasting life .
» If you want to serve me follow me ! My servant will be where I am and the Father will honor my servant .
» I am troubled ! What should I say ? Father , save me out of this hour ? It is for this purpose that I came to this hour !
» Father , glorify your name . « A voice came from heaven : » I have both glorified it , and will glorify it again . «
The crowd near him only heard thunder . Some said an angel spoke to him .
Jesus said : » This voice came for your sake and not for mine .
» Now judgment is on this world . Now the ruler of this world will be cast out .
» When I am lifted up from the earth I will draw all men to myself . «
He said this indicating the type of death he would experience .
The crowd answered him : » We have heard from the law that the Christ lives forever . Why do you say the Son of man must be lifted up ? Who is this Son of man ? «
Jesus said to them : » The light will be with you for a little while . Walk while you have the light , that darkness does not overtake you . He who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes .
» While you have the light , exert active faith in the light , that you may become sons of light . « Jesus said this and then he departed and hid himself from them .
Even though he performed many miracles in front of them they did not believe in him .
The word of Isaiah the prophet was fulfilled : » Jehovah who has believed our report ? And to whom has the arm of Jehovah been revealed ? «
Isaiah revealed the reason they could not believe :
» He has blinded their eyes . He hardened their heart . Otherwise they would see with their eyes and perceive with their heart . Then they would turn and I would heal them . «
Isaiah said these things because he saw and spoke about his glory .
Many of the rulers believed in him , although they did not confess their faith because of the Pharisees , for they would be expelled from the synagogue .
They loved the glory from men more than the glory from God .
Jesus cried out : » He , who believes in me , believes not in me , but in him who sent me .
» He that sees me sees perceives discerns experiences the one who sent me .
» I have come as a light to the world . Everyone who believes in me will not remain in darkness .
» If any man hears my sayings and does not obey them I will not judge him . I came not to judge the world , but to save the world .
» He that rejects me and does not accept my message has one that judges him . The word divine expression God’s Word that I spoke shall judge him now and in the last day .
» I spoke not from myself but from the Father who sent me . He has given me a commandment concerning what I should say when I speak .
» I know that his commandment means everlasting life . Therefore I say the things the Father tells me to say . «
Jesus knew before the feast of the Passover that the time had come for him to leave this world and return to his Father . He loved his own who were in the world to the very end .
The devil influenced the heart of Judas Iscariot , Simon’s son . So he betrayed him during the meal .
Jesus knew that the Father had given him power over all things . He also knew it came from God and he returns it to God .
He got up from the meal and laid aside his garments . He wrapped a towel around his waist .
Then he poured water into the basin and washed the disciples’ feet . He wiped them with the towel he was wearing .
When he approached , Simon Peter said : » Lord do you wash my feet ? «
» You do not know what I do now , « Jesus said : » but you will understand later . «
Peter said : » You will never wash my feet . « Jesus answered him : » If I do not wash you ; you have no part with me . «
Simon Peter replied : » Lord , not my feet only , but also my hands and my head . «
Jesus responded : » He that is bathed must wash his feet . He is clean everywhere and you are clean , but not all . «
He knew who would betray him . That is why he said you are not all clean .
After he washed their feet he put his outer garments on and sat down . He asked : » Do you know what I have done to you ?
» You call me Teacher and Lord and you are right for I am .
» If the Teacher and Lord washed your feet you should wash one another’s feet .
» I have given you an example . You should also do as I have done to you .
» Truly I tell you , a servant is not greater than his master . Neither is one that is sent greater than he that sent him .
» If you know these things , you are blessed if you do them .
» I do not speak about all of you . I know whom I have chosen ! This way the scripture may be fulfilled : ‘ He that eats my bread lifted up his heel against me . ’ «
» I tell you before it happens . So that when it takes place you may believe that I am he .
» Truly I say to you , he who receives whom ever I send receives me . And he who receives me receives him who sent me .
After Jesus said this he was troubled in spirit and said : One of you will betray me . «
The disciples looked at each other . They were perplexed and wondered who it would be .
The disciple whom Jesus loved was leaning on his chest .
Simon Peter motioned to him : » Ask him who it is , « he urged .
He leaned back on Jesus’ breast and said to him : » Lord , who is it ? «
Jesus answered : » It is he to whom I give a piece of bread after I dip it . « So when he dipped the bread he gave it to Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot .
After he was given the piece of bread Satan entered him . Jesus said to him : » Do what you do quickly . «
No man at the table knew for what purpose he spoke this to him .
Some thought Judas was going to shop for food for the feast or give something to the poor . Judas was in charge of the moneybox .
He received the morsel of bread and left immediately . It was night .
When he was gone Jesus said : » Now the Son of man is glorified praised exulted proclaimed honored and God is glorified through him .
» If God is glorified through him , God will also immediately glorify him .
» Little children I am with you for a little while . You will seek me and as I told the Jews now I say to you , where I go , you cannot come .
» I give you a new commandment , that you love one another . Just as I have loved you , you also love one another .
» All men will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another . «
Simon Peter said : » Lord where are you going ? « Jesus answered : » Where I am going you cannot follow me now . You will follow me later . «
Peter said : » Lord , why can I not follow you now ? I will lay down my life for you . «
Jesus answered : » Will you lay down your life for me ? Truly I tell you the cock will not crow till you have denied me three times . «
» Do not let your hearts be troubled . You believe in God , believe also in me .
» In my Father’s house are many dwelling places . If it were not so , I would have told you . I go to prepare a place for you .
» If I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and I will receive you to myself , for where I am you may also be .
» You know where I go and you know the way . «
Thomas said to him : » Lord , we do not know where you go . How do we know the way ? «
Jesus proclaimed : » I am the way , the truth , and the life ! No one comes to the Father except through me .
» If you had known me , you would have perceived my Father also . From now on you understand him and have experienced him . «
Philip said : » Lord , show us the Father , and it is sufficient for us . «
Jesus responded : » Have I been with you so long a time and you do not know me Philip ? He who has seen me has discerned experienced perceived the Father . And you say , show us the Father ?
» Do you not believe that I am with the Father and that the Father is with me ? The words I say to you are not from me , but the Father dwells with me and does his works .
» Believe me that I am with the Father and the Father is with me , or else believe me because of the works .
» Truly I tell you , he who exerts active faith in me will do the works that I do . In fact he will do greater works than these . I go to the Father .
» Whatever you ask in my name , I will do . That way the Father may be glorified because of the Son .
» If you ask anything in my name , I will do it .
» If you love me , you will keep obey my commandments !
» I will pray to the Father , and he will give you another helper , that he the Father may be with you forever .
» It is the Spirit of the truth . The world cannot receive it . The world does not see or know it . You know it because it lives with you and will be with you .
» I will not leave you desolate . I will come to you .
» A little while and the world will not see me anymore , but you will . I live and you will also live .
» In that day you will know that I am with my Father , and you with me , and I with you .
» He that has my commandments , and obeys them loves me . My Father will love the person who loves me . I will love him and disclose myself to him . «
Judas not Iscariot asked him : » Lord , what will happen that you will disclose yourself to us , and not to the world ? «
Jesus answered : » If a man loves me , he will obey my word . My Father will love him , and we will come to him and dwell with him .
» He who does not love me does not obey my words . The word you hear is not mine , but comes from the Father who sent me .
» I speak these things while being present with you .
» The Father will send a helper in my name , the Holy Spirit , which Greek : hos he ho which that one will teach you all things and bring to your memory all that I said to you .
» Peace I leave with you ! My peace I give to you . I do not give as the world gives to you . Do not let your heart be troubled or full of fear .
» You heard me say I will go away and I will come again to you . If you loved me , you would have rejoiced , because I go to the Father . The Father is greater than I !
» Now I told you before it takes place . That way when it happens you may believe .
» I will speak no more with you . The prince of the world comes . He has no hold on me !
» The world must know that I love the Father . And I obey the Father’s commandments . Get up and let us leave here . «
» I am the true vine , and my Father is the cultivator .
» He takes away the branches in me that do not bear fruit . He cleans every branch that bears fruit . That way it may bear more fruit .
» You are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you .
» Remain with me , and I with you . The branch cannot bear fruit by itself . It must remain on the vine . Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain with me .
» I am the vine and you are the branches . He that remains with me , and I with him , the same bears much fruit . You can do nothing apart from me .
» If a man does not remain with me , he is removed as a branch , and withers . They gather them and throw them into the fire where they are burned destroyed consumed .
» If you remain with me , and my words remain with you , ask whatever you will , and it will be done for you .
» My Father is glorified when you bear much fruit . You will be my disciples .
» I love you just as the Father has loved me . Remain in my love .
» If you obey my commandments you will remain in my love . I have obeyed my Father’s commandments and remain in his love .
» I spoke these things in order that my joy may continue with you and your joy may be made full .
» This is my commandment , that you love one another , even as I have loved you .
» No man has greater love then this that a man lay down his life for his friends .
» You are my friends if you do the things that I command you .
» I no longer call you servants for the servant does not know what the lord does . I have called you friends ; for all things that I heard from my Father , I have made known to you .
» You did not choose me . I chose you and appointed you . You should go and bear fruit and your fruit should remain . Whatever you ask the Father in my name , he may give it to you .
» These things I command you , that you may love one another .
» If the world hates you , you know that it has hated me before it hated you .
» If you were of the world , the world would love its own . I chose you out of the world . The world hates you because you are not of the world .
» Remember the word I said to you . A servant is not greater than his master . If they persecuted me , they will also persecute you . If they obeyed my word , they will obey yours also .
» They will do all these things to you for my name’s sake . It is because they do not know the one that sent me .
» If I had not come and spoken to them , they would not have sin . Now they have no excuse for their sin !
» He who hates me hates my Father also .
» If I had not done among them the works that no one else did , they would have no sin . They have seen and hated both my Father and me .
» This took place that the word written in the Law may be fulfilled : They hated me without a cause .
» I will send the helper from the Father , the Spirit of truth , which proceeds from the Father to bear witness of me .
» You also bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning . «
» I have spoken these things to you that you should not be made to stumble .
» They will throw you out of the synagogues . Yes , the hour comes that whoever kills you will think that he offered service to God .
» But they do these things because they do not know the Father or me .
» I tell you these things so you will remember that I told you when the time comes . I did not tell this from the beginning because I was with you .
» I go to him that sent me . None of you asks me : Where are you going ?
» Now that I have spoken these things to you , sorrow fills your heart .
» Nevertheless I tell you the truth . It is for your benefit that I go away . For if I do not go away the helper will not come to you . But if I go , I will send it to you . Greek : autos : it
» Upon arrival this one will convict the world of sin , and of righteousness , and of judgment .
» First of sin because they do not practice active faith in me .
» Second , of righteousness , because I go to the Father and you will not see me anymore .
» And third , of judgment because the prince of this world has been judged .
» I have yet many things to say to you , but you cannot endure them now .
» When the Spirit of truth comes it will guide you to all truth for it will not speak from itself . It will speak the things it hears and declare to you the things that are to come .
» It will glorify me and will take of what I have and declare it to you .
» All the things the Father has are mine . That is why I said the Spirit takes what I have and declares it to you .
» A little while and you will see me no more and again a little while , and you will see me . «
Some of his disciples said to one another : » What is this he says , a little while , and you see me no more and again a little while and you will see me because I go to the Father ?
» What is this that he says : A little while ? We do not know what he says . «
Jesus perceived what they wanted to ask him . He said to them : » You inquire among yourselves concerning what I said . A little while , and you will not see me , and again a little while , and you will see me ?
» Truly I tell you , you will weep and lament , but the world will rejoice . You will be sorrowful , but your sorrow will be turned into joy .
» A woman in tribulation has sorrow , because her hour to give birth has come . When she delivers the child , she remembers no more anguish , because of the joy that a man is born into the world .
» You have sorrow now . But I will see you again . Your heart will rejoice and no one can take your joy from you .
» You will ask me for nothing then . Truly I say to you , if you ask anything of the Father , he will give it to you in my name .
» Until now you have not asked a single thing in my name . Ask , and you will receive , that your joy may be made full .
» I have spoken to you in figurative language illustrations and proverbs . The hour comes when I will no longer speak to you in figurative language . I will tell you plainly from the Father .
» In that day you will ask in my name . I do not say to you , that I will pray to the Father for you . It will not be necessary .
The Father loves you , because you loved me , and believed that I came from the Father .
» I came out from the Father and came into the world . I leave the world and go to the Father . «
His disciples said : » See now you speak plainly and use no figurative language .
» We are sure you know all things and have no need that any man ask you questions . Because of this we believe you came from God . «
Jesus asked them : » Do you now believe ?
» Behold ! The hour comes , and indeed , it is here , that you will be scattered and each one will leave me alone . Yet I am not alone because the Father is with me .
» I spoke to you that in me you might have peace . In the world you have tribulation . Be of good cheer for I have conquered the world ! «
Jesus spoke these things and lifted up his eyes to heaven . He said : » Father , the hour has come . Glorify your Son , that the son may glorify you .
» You have given him authority over all flesh that he may give everlasting life to the ones whom you have given him .
» This is everlasting life that they should have deep , intimate knowledge of you , the only true God , and Jesus Christ whom you have commissioned . Greek : ginosko : know , perceive , be sure , understand
» I glorified you on the earth . I accomplished the work you gave me to do .
» And now , Father , glorify me with you , the glory that I had with you before the world existed .
» I taught your name to the men whom you gave me out of the world . They were yours and you gave them to me . They have lived by your word .
» Now they know that all things you gave me are from you .
» I gave them the words that you gave me . They understood them and knew I came from you . They believed you sent me .
» I pray for them . I do not pray for the world . I pray only for those you gave me , for they are yours .
» All things that are mine are yours , and yours are mine and I am glorified in them .
» I am no more in the world but they are in the world . I come to you Holy Father . Keep them in your name , which you have given to me , that they may be one , even as we are . Greek : heis ; united in purpose and love
» While I was with them I kept them in your name , which you have given to me . I guarded them , and not one of them perished , except the son of perdition ; that the Scripture might be fulfilled .
» Now I come to you . I spoke these things in the world , that they may have my joy made full in themselves .
» I gave them your word . The world hated them because they are not of the world , even as I am not of the world .
» I do not pray that you take them out of the world , but that you keep them from the evil one .
» They are not of the world even as I am not of the world .
» Sanctify them by your truth . Your word is truth .
» As you commissioned sent me into the world , I commissioned sent them into the world .
» I sanctify myself for them , that they may be sanctified by truth .
» I pray , not for these alone but for those who will believe in me through their word .
» May they all be united in agreement as one . Just as you , Father , are with me , and I am with you . Help them be united with us ! That way the world may believe that you sent me .
» I have given them the glory that you gave me in order that they may be one even as we are one .
» I with them , and you with me , that they may accomplish complete unity . That way the world may know that you sent me and that you love them just as you love me .
» Father , I desire that these whom you gave me may be with me where I am . I want them to see the glory you have given me . For you loved me before the creation of the world .
» Righteous Father , the world has not known you . I know you and those you sent me know you .
» I have made your name known , and will make it known . That way your love for me may be with them and I may be with them . «
When Jesus finished his prayer he and his disciples crossed the Kedron winter stream to a garden .
Judas , who betrayed him , knew the place because Jesus went there frequently with his disciples .
Judas brought a band of armed men and police from the chief priests and Pharisees there with lights and with weapons .
Jesus knew what was about to happen to him . He asked : » Whom do you seek ? «
They answered him : » Jesus of Nazareth . « Jesus replied : » I am he . « Judas the betrayer was with them .
When he said to them I am he they drew back and fell to the ground .
Again he asked : » Whom do you seek ? « And they said : » Jesus of Nazareth . «
Jesus answered : » I told you that I am he . If you seek me let these go their way . «
That way the word he spoke might be fulfilled ; ‘ I lost none of those you gave me . ’
Simon Peter drew the sword he had , struck the high priest’s servant , and cut off his right ear . The servant’s name was Malchus .
Jesus said to Peter : » Put the sword in the sheath . Shall I drink the cup the Father has given me ? «
The soldiers , the military commanders , and the officers of the Jews , seized Jesus and bound him .
They led him to Annas first for he was father in law to Caiaphas who was high priest that year .
Caiaphas was the man who gave counsel to the Jews that it was for their benefit that one man should die for the people .
Simon Peter followed Jesus and so did another disciple . The high priest knew that disciple . He entered the court of the high priest with Jesus .
Peter stood outside the door . The disciple known by the high priest went out and spoke to the woman who kept the door and he brought in Peter .
The maid that kept the door asked Peter : » Are you also one of this man’s disciples ? « He said : » I am not . «
It was cold . So the servants and officers warmed themselves by the fire . Peter also stood by the fire to get warm .
The high priest asked Jesus about his disciples and about the things he taught .
Jesus answered him : » I have spoken openly to the world . I always taught in synagogues , and in the temple where all the Jews gathered . I spoke nothing in secret .
» Why do you ask me ? Ask them that heard me what I spoke to them . They know the things I said . «
When he said this one of the officers standing nearby struck Jesus with his hand , saying : » You answer the high priest ! «
Jesus answered him : » If I spoke evil , bear witness of the evil . But if I spoke honestly , why do you strike me ? «
Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest .
Simon Peter stood nearby warming himself . They asked him : » Are you also one of his disciples ? « He denied it saying : » I am not . «
One of the servants of the high priest , being a relative of him whose ear Peter cut off , said : » Did I see you in the garden with him ? «
Peter denied it again . Then the cock crowed .
They lead Jesus from Caiaphas into the Praetorium . It was early and they did not enter directly into the Praetorium , that they might not be defiled , but might eat the Passover .
Pilate went to them and asked : » What accusation do you make against this man ? «
They answered : » If this man were not an evildoer we would not deliver him to you . «
Pilate replied : » Take him yourselves and judge him according to your law . « The Jews said : » It is not lawful for us to put any man to death . «
Thus the word of Jesus would be fulfilled when he spoke about the kind of death he would experience .
Pilate entered again into the Praetorium . He called Jesus and asked him : » Are you the King of the Jews ? «
Jesus answered : » You say this about me . Or did others tell you it concerning me ? «
Pilate answered : » Am I a Jew ? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me ! What have you done ? «
Jesus answered : » My kingdom is not of this world ! If my kingdom were of this world my servants would fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews . My kingdom is not from this domain . «
Pilate said : » Are you a king then ? « Jesus answered : » As you say I am a king . I was born and came into the world for this purpose , that I should bear witness to the truth ! Every one who is of the truth hears my voice . «
Pilate then asked : » What is truth ? « After saying this , he went out again to the Jews and said to them : » I find no fault in him .
» You have a custom that I release someone to you at the Passover . Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews ? «
They cried out : » Not this man , but Barabbas . Barabbas was a robber . «
Then Pilate took Jesus and whipped him .
The soldiers braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head . They dressed him in a purple garment .
They came to him , and said : » Hail , King of the Jews ! « They struck him with their hands .
Pilate went out again , and said to them : » Look , I bring him out to you , that you may know that I find no fault in him . «
Jesus came out , wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment . Pilate said : » Look , the man ! «
When the chief priests and officers saw him , they cried out : » Impale him ! Impale him ! « Pilate replied : » Take him yourselves , and impale him for he has committed no crime ! «
The Jews answered him : » We have a law , and by that law he ought to die , because he made himself the Son of God . «
When Pilate heard this he was more afraid .
He entered into the Praetorium again , and said to Jesus : » Where are you from ? « But Jesus gave him no answer .
Pilate said : » Will you not speak to me ? Do you know I have the power to release you and the power to impale you ? «
Jesus answered him : » You would have no power against me except it was given you from above . Therefore he that delivered me to you has greater sin . «
As a result of this Pilate sought to release him . The Jews cried out : » If you release this man you are not Caesar’s friend . Every one that makes himself a king speaks against Caesar . «
When Pilate heard these words he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment-seat . They were at a place called The Stone Pavement , but in Hebrew , Gabbatha .
Now it was the Preparation of the Passover , about the sixth hour . And he said to the Jews : » Behold , your King ! «
They cried out : » Away with him , away with him , impale him ! « Pilate asked : » Should I impale your King ? « The chief priests answered : » We have no king but Caesar . «
Then he delivered him to them to be impaled .
They took Jesus bearing his own stake to the place called the place of a skull , which is called in Hebrew , Golgotha .
They impaled him there . Two others were impaled and Jesus stake was placed in the middle .
Pilate wrote a title and put it on the stake . There it was written , JESUS OF NAZARETH , THE KING OF THE JEWS .
This title was read by many of the Jews , for the place where Jesus was impaled was near the city . It was written in Hebrew , Latin and Greek .
The chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate : » Do not write , The King of the Jews ; but that he said , I am King of the Jews . «
Pilate answered : » What I have written , I have written . «
After they impaled Jesus the soldiers took his garments and made four parts , one for each soldier . The coat was without seam , woven from the top throughout .
They said to one another , Let us not tear the coat . So they cast lots for it . That fulfilled the scripture that said : » They parted my garments among them , and they cast lots for my covering . «
His mother stood by the stake of Jesus , and his mother’s sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .
Jesus saw his mother , and the disciple whom he loved . He said to his mother , » Woman , look , your son ! «
Then he said to the disciple , » Look , your mother ! « That hour forward the disciple took her to his home .
He knew that it was over . In order that the scripture might be accomplished , he said : » I thirst . «
A vessel full of vinegar was setting there . They put a sponge full of vinegar upon a hyssop branch and brought it to his mouth .
When Jesus received the vinegar , he said , » it is finished . « He bowed his head , and he stopped breathing .
It was Preparation and the Jews insisted that bodies not remain on the stake on the Sabbath . The day of that Sabbath was a high day . They asked Pilate that the legs be broken and that they might be taken away .
The soldiers broke the legs of the two who were impaled with him .
When they came to Jesus , and saw that he was dead already so they did not break his legs .
The soldier with the spear pierced his side and suddenly blood and water came out .
He who saw testified and his testimony is true . He knows and he speaks truth that you also may believe .
These things came to pass in order that the scripture might be fulfilled : A bone of him shall not be broken .
And again another scripture said : They should look on him whom they pierced .
Joseph of Arimathaea was a disciple of Jesus . He approached Pilate secretly for fear of the Jews . He asked Pilate for permission to take away the body of Jesus . Pilate gave him permission . So he took the body away .
Nicodemus also came with a mixture of myrrh and about a hundred pounds of aloes . Nicodemus is the one who came to Jesus at night .
They prepared the body of Jesus for burial . They bound it in linen cloths with spices . This was the custom of the Jews .
There was a garden at the place where he was impaled . It contained a new tomb where no one had been buried .
They laid Jesus there because the Jews Preparation was close at hand .
Mary Magdalene arrived at the tomb early on the first day of the week while it was still dark . She saw the stone was taken away from the tomb .
She ran to Simon Peter and the other disciple whom Jesus loved and said to them : » They have taken the Lord away out of the tomb . We do not know where they laid him . «
Peter and the other disciple went to the tomb .
They both ran together . The other disciple out ran Peter and got to the tomb first .
He stooped and looked inside where he saw the linen clothes . He did not enter .
Simon Peter followed him to the tomb and entered to see the linen clothes laying there .
The napkin that was on his head was not with the linen clothes . It was rolled up by itself .
The other disciple entered the tomb . He saw and believed .
They still did not know the Scripture that he must rise from the dead .
The disciples went away again to their own home .
Mary stood outside the tomb weeping . She stooped and looked into the tomb .
She saw two angels in white sitting , one at the head , and one at the feet , where the body of Jesus had lain .
» Woman why do you weep , « they asked ? She told them : » They have taken my Lord and I do not know where they laid him . «
She turned and look there was Jesus standing nearby . She did not know it was Jesus .
Jesus said to her : » Woman , why do you weep ? Who are you looking for ? « She thought he was the gardener . She said : » Sir , if you have carried him somewhere else tell me where you laid him and I will take him away . «
Jesus said : » Mary . « She turned and said to him in Hebrew : » Rabboni , « which is to say , Teacher .
Jesus said : » Do not touch me for I am not yet ascended to the Father . Go to my brothers , and say to them , I ascend to my Father and you ’ re Father , and my God and your God . «
Mary Magdalene went to tell the disciples : » I have seen the Lord ! He said these things to me . «
It was evening of the first day of the week . The disciples shut the doors where they stayed for fear of the Jews . Jesus came and stood in the midst , and said to them : » May you have Peace . «
When he said this , he showed them his hands and his side . The disciples were glad , when they saw the Lord .
Jesus therefore said to them again : » May you have peace . As the Father sent me , even so I send you . «
After he said this he breathed on them and said : » Receive Holy Spirit .
» Forgive sins and they are forgiven . Do not forgive sins and they are not forgiven . «
Thomas , one of the twelve , called Didymus , was not with them when Jesus came .
The other disciples therefore said to him : » We have seen the Lord . « He said : » Unless I feel the print of the nails in his hands and put my hand into his side , I will not believe . «
Eight days later the disciples were inside with the doors shut and Thomas was with them . Jesus came in and stood in the midst , and said : » Peace be with you . «
Jesus said to Thomas : » Put your finger here and look at my hands . Put your hand into my side . Stop doubting and believe ! «
Thomas answered : » My Lord and my God ! «
Jesus said to him : » Because you saw me , you believe . Blessed are they that have not seen , and yet believe ! «
Jesus did many miracles signs in the presence of the disciples . They are not written in this book .
These are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God . By believing you may have life in his name .
Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias . He presented himself this way .
There were together Simon Peter ; Thomas called Didymus , and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee , the sons of Zebedee , and two other of his disciples .
Simon Peter said to them : » I am going fishing . « They told him : » We would also come with you . « They boarded the boat and caught nothing that night .
Jesus stood on the beach at daybreak . The disciples did not know it was Jesus .
Jesus said to them : » Children , have you anything to eat ? « They answered him : » No . «
He said : » Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find fish . « They cast it and they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes .
That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter : » It is the Lord . « So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he wrapped his coat about him for he was dressed only in undergarments , and jumped into the sea .
The other disciples came in the little boat for they were not far from the land , but about one hundred yards away , dragging the net full of fishes .
When they got to land , they saw a fire of coals and fish laid on it , and bread .
Jesus said : » Bring the fish you caught . «
Simon Peter went to draw the net to land . It was full of great fishes , a hundred and fifty three in all . There were so many and yet the net was not torn .
Jesus said to them : » Come and eat . « And none of the disciples dared to inquire , who are you ? They just knew it was the Lord .
Jesus came , took the bread and fish and gave it to them .
This is the third time Jesus was seen by the disciples since he was raised from the dead .
When they had eaten Jesus said to Simon Peter : » Simon , son of John , do you love me more than these ? « He said : » Yes Lord ; you know I have affection for you . « Jesus said to him : » Feed my lambs . «
He spoke to him a second time : » Simon , son of John , do you love me ? « He replied : » Yes Lord , you know I have affection for you . « Then Jesus said : » Shepherd my sheep . «
The third time Jesus said to him : » Simon , son of John , do you have affection for me ? « Peter was grieved . Because he said to him the third time , do you have affection for me ? Peter replied : » Lord , you know all things ; you know I have affection for you ! « Jesus said to him : » Feed my sheep . «
» Truly , truly , I tell you , when you were young you dressed yourself and walked wherever you wanted . But when you become old , you stretch out your hands and another dresses you , and carries you where you do not want to go . «
Now this he spoke , signifying by what manner of death he should glorify God . After he spoke he said : » Follow me . «
Peter , turning about , saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following . He is the one who also leaned back on his breast at the supper , and said , « Lord , who is he that betrays you ? «
Seeing this Peter said to Jesus : Lord , what shall this man do ?
Jesus said : » If it is my will that he stay until I come , what is that to you ? You follow me . «
This expression went among the brethren , that that disciple should not die . Yet Jesus did not say that he should not die . He only said : » If I will that he stay until I come , what is that to you ? «
This is the disciple that bears witness of these things , and wrote these things . That way we know that his witness is true .
There are many other things that Jesus did . Should all of them be written I suppose the world would not contain the books written .
The first account I composed , O Theophilus , was about all that Jesus did and taught ,
until the day he was received up to heaven . After that he gave orders through the Holy Spirit to his chosen apostles .
He presented himself alive to them after his suffering . He gave many convincing proofs . He appeared to them during forty days speaking about the kingdom of God .
When they were gathered together he charged them not to depart from Jerusalem . They were to wait for the promise of the Father that he spoke about .
» John baptized with water ; but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit in a few days , « He said .
When they met they asked him : » Lord will you restore the kingdom to Israel at this time ? «
He replied : » It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has set within His own authority .
» You will receive power , when the Holy Spirit comes on you and you will be my witnesses both in Jerusalem , and in all Judea and Samaria , and to the ends of the earth . «
When he said these things , while they watched , he was taken up ; and a cloud received him out of their sight .
They gazed intently into the sky as he went into heaven . Two men wearing white stood beside them .
They said : » You men of Galilee , why do you stand looking into heaven ? This Jesus , who was received up from you into heaven will come in a similar manner as you saw him go into heaven . «
Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet , which is near Jerusalem , a Sabbath day’s journey away .
When they entered the city they went to the upper chamber where they were staying . Included were Peter and John and James and Andrew , Philip and Thomas , Bartholomew and Matthew , James the son of Alphaeus , and Simon the Zealous one , and Judas the son of James .
They all continued united in earnest prayer . The women , and Mary the mother of Jesus , and his brothers were also there .
In these days Peter stood up among the brothers about a hundred and twenty , and said :
» Brothers , the Scripture needed to be fulfilled , which the Holy Spirit spoke by the mouth of David concerning Judas , who guided those who arrested Jesus .
» He was numbered among us , and shared in this ministry .
» This man obtained a field with the reward of his wickedness ; and falling headlong , he burst open and all his intestines spilled out . The rope broke or the branch on which it was tied broke . Then he fell to the ground and burst open .
» It became known to all who live in Jerusalem that the field was called the field of blood , in their language ; Akeldama .
» It is written in the book of Psalms : ‘ Let his habitation be made desolate and let no man dwell there . Let another take his office . ’
» Someone must join us as a witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus . He must be one of the men who were in our group during the time that the Lord Jesus traveled about with us . This should be from the time John preached his message of baptism until the day Jesus was taken up from us to heaven .
» One who was with us from the baptism of John , to the day that he was received up from us must become a witness with us of his resurrection . «
They proposed two men : Joseph called Barsabbas , who was surnamed Justus , and Matthias .
They prayed : » You O Jehovah , know the hearts of all men . Show us which of these men you choose .
» Which of these men should assume this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell away , that he might go to his own place . «
They cast lots for them and the lot fell on Matthias . So he was included with the eleven apostles .
When the day of Pentecost came , they were all with one accord in one place .
Suddenly there came a sound from heaven like a rushing mighty wind . It filled the house where they were sitting .
Tongues of fire that sat on each of them appeared .
They were all filled with the Holy Spirit . They began to speak with different tongues , as the Spirit moved them to speak .
Devout Jews from every nation under heaven were dwelling at Jerusalem .
When they heard this sound a crowd came together in confusion , because men heard them speak in their own language .
And they were all amazed and marveled . They said to each other : » Behold , are not all these that speak Galileans ? «
» How do we each hear them in our own language ?
» Parthians , and Medes , and Elamites , and the dwellers in Mesopotamia , and in Judea , and Cappadocia , in Pontus , and Asia ,
» Phrygia , and Pamphylia , in Egypt , and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene , and strangers of Rome , Jews and proselytes ,
» Cretes and Arabians , we hear them speak in our language the wonderful works of God . «
And they were all amazed and were in doubt . They asked each other : » What does this mean ? «
Others mockingly said : » These men are full of new wine . «
But Peter , stood up with the eleven , lifted up his voice , and said to them : » You men of Judea , and all you who dwell at Jerusalem let me explain this to you . Listen to my words .
» These men are not drunk as you suppose for it is only nine o ’ clock in the morning .
» This is what the prophet Joel spoke about :
» It will come to pass in the last days , says God , I will pour out from my Spirit upon all flesh . Greek : apo , from Your sons and your daughters will prophesy proclaim God’s Word . Your young men will see visions , and your old men will dream dreams .
» And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out a portion from some of my Spirit in those days and they will prophesy :
» I will show wonders in heaven above , and signs in the earth beneath : blood , and fire , and vapor of smoke .
» The sun will be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before that great and notable awesome Day of Jehovah arrives .
» It will come to pass , that whoever will call on the name of Jehovah will be saved .
» You men of Israel hear these words . Jesus of Nazareth , a man approved by God came among you with miracles and wonders and signs . God did these by him in your midst , as you also know :
» You took this man and delivered him by the determined counsel purpose and foreknowledge of God . With wicked hands you impaled and murdered him .
» God resurrected him , loosing the pains of death . This is because it was not possible that he should be held fast by it .
» David spoke concerning him : ‘ I had Jehovah always before my face , for he is at my right hand , that I should not be shaken .
‘ » Therefore did my heart rejoice , and my tongue was glad ; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope :
‘ » Because you will not leave me in the grave , neither will you allow your Holy One to see corruption .
‘ » You have made known to me the ways of life , and you will fill me with joy with your presence . ’
» Men and brothers let me freely speak to you about the patriarch David that he is dead and buried . His grave is with us to this day .
» Therefore being a prophet , and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him , that of the fruit of his loins , according to the flesh , he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne .
» He seeing this before spoke about the resurrection of Christ . That he would not be left in the grave and his flesh did not see corruption .
» God resurrected Jesus and we all witnessed this !
« He is exalted to the right hand of God . He has received the promised Holy Spirit from the Father . So he poured out what you now see and hear .
» For David has not ascended into heaven and yet he said : ‘ Jehovah said to my Lord , Sit at my right hand ,
‘ » until I make your enemies your footstool . ’
» Therefore let all the house of Israel know for sure that God has made that same Jesus , whom you impaled , both Lord and Christ . «
Now when they heard this , they were stabbed to the heart , and said to Peter and to the rest of the apostles : » Men and brothers , what shall we do ? «
Then Peter said : » Repent , and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of your sins , and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit .
» The promise is to you , and to your children , and to all that are afar off , even as many as Jehovah our God calls . «
He gave a thorough witness with many words and exhorted them , saying : » Save yourselves from this indecent generation . «
Those who gladly received his word were baptized . About three thousand persons were added the same day .
They continued devoting themselves to doctrine and fellowship , and in breaking of bread , and in prayers .
Every person experienced a sense of awe , for the apostles did many wonders and signs .
All those who believed stayed together . They held all things in common .
They sold their possessions and goods , and distributed them to all men , as every man had need .
They continued daily with one accord in the temple , and breaking bread from house to house . They ate their food with gladness and singleness of heart .
As they praised God , they had favor with all the people . God added to the congregation daily those being saved .
Peter and John went up to the temple at the hour of prayer . It was the ninth hour .
A man who had been crippled from birth was carried to the gate of the temple called Beautiful . There he begged for handouts from those who entered the temple .
Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple he begged from them .
Peter and John looked at him and said : » Look at us . «
He looked at them expecting to receive something from them .
Then Peter said : » We have no money but what I have I give you . In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk . «
He took him by the right hand , and lifted him up . Immediately his feet and anklebones received strength .
He leaped up , stood and walked . He entered the temple with them walking , and leaping , and praising God .
All the people saw him walking and praising God .
They knew he was the one who begged at the Beautiful gate of the temple . They were filled with wonder and amazement because of what happened to him .
The beggar held on to Peter and John while all the people came to them at the place called Solomon’s Colonnade .
When Peter saw this he spoke to the people : » You men of Israel , why are you amazed at this ? Why do you look at us as though our own power or holiness made this man walk ?
» The God of Abraham , and of Isaac , and of Jacob , the God of our fathers , has glorified his Son Jesus . You handed him over to Pilate . When he was determined to let him go you denied him .
» You disowned the Holy and Righteous One and requested a murderer to be released to you .
» You killed the Prince of life , whom God raised from the dead . We witnessed this !
» This man you see and know was made strong by his faith in the name of Jesus . His faith has given him total healing in your presence .
» Brothers , I know you acted in ignorance just as your rulers did .
» The things God fulfilled he announced beforehand by the mouth of all his prophets , that Christ should suffer .
» Repent therefore , and turn around , that your sins may be blotted out , when the times seasons of refreshing shall come from the presence of Jehovah .
» He will send Jesus Christ , who preached to you .
whom heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things . God spoke about this through all his holy prophets since the world began .
» Moses said to the fathers , ‘ Jehovah will raise up for your brothers a prophet like me . You must listen to all the things he speaks to you . ’
» It will happen . Every person who will not listen to the prophet will be destroyed from among the people .
» Yes , all the prophets from Samuel and his successors also announced these days .
» You are the children of the prophets , and of the covenant that God made with our fathers . He said to Abraham : ‘ All the families of the earth will be blessed in your seed . ’
» God raised up his servant and sent him to you first . He sent him to bless you and to turn every one of you from your wicked ways . «
As they spoke to the people , the chief priests , the captain of the temple , and the Sadducees came to them .
They were annoyed because they taught the people through Jesus . They preached the resurrection from the dead .
They laid hands on them , and put them in custody until the next day for it was already evening .
Many who heard the word believed . There were about five thousand men .
The next morning their rulers , elders , scribes ,
Annas the high priest , Caiaphas , John , Alexander , and as many as were of the family of the high priest , were gathered together at Jerusalem .
They stood them in their presence and asked : » By what power or by what name do you do this ? «
Then Peter , filled with the Holy Spirit , said : » You rulers of the people , and elders of Israel ,
» If we are on trial for a good deed done to a sick man , concerning how this man was made well ;
» Let it be known to you and to all the people of Israel , that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth , whom you impaled and whom God raised from the dead , even by him this man stands before you healed .
» This is the stone that was rejected by you builders . It became the chief corner stone .
» There is no salvation in anyone else . For there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved . «
They observed the confidence of Peter and John . Yet they thought they were uneducated not formally educated and ordinary men . They were amazed and recognized them as having been with Jesus .
Seeing the man who was healed standing with them , they had nothing to say in reply .
They ordered them to leave the council . Then they conferred among themselves .
They said : » What shall we do to these men ? The fact that a notable miracle has been done by them is evident to all who live in Jerusalem . And we cannot deny it .
» We must warn these men not to speak about it in order to stop this from spreading further among the people . «
They called them , and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus .
Peter and John answered : » You judge whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God .
» We cannot stop speaking the things we have seen and heard . «
When they further threatened them , they let them go . They found no basis for punishment because of the people for all men glorified God for that which was done .
The man who received the miracle of healing was about forty years old .
Being released , they went to their own and reported all that the chief priests and elders said to them .
When they heard they lifted up their voice to God with one accord , and said : » Jehovah , you are God , who made heaven and earth , the sea and all in them .
» You spoke by the mouth of your servant David : Why did the heathen rage , and the people imagine vain things ?
» The kings of the earth stood up , and the rulers were gathered together against Jehovah , and against his Christ .
Truly both Herod and Pontius Pilate , along with the people of the nations and the people of Israel , were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus , whom you have anointed .
» They were there to do the things your hand and council foreordained to occur .
» Now Jehovah behold their threats and grant that your servants keep speaking your word with boldness .
» You extend your hand to heal and signs and wonders appear in the name of your holy servant Jesus . «
When they prayed , the place where they assembled together was shaken . They were all filled with the Holy Spirit , and they spoke the word of God with boldness .
The congregation that believed was of one heart and mind . No one claimed his or her own possessions for everything was common property .
The apostles witnessed about the resurrection of the Lord Jesus with great power . Grace God’s loving kindness was upon them all .
There was no needy person among them for as many as possessed land or houses sold them , and brought the money from the things that were sold .
They gave it to the apostles . Distribution was made to every man according as he had need .
Joses , who was surnamed Barnabas by the apostles , this meaning : The son of consolation , was a Levite , and of the country of Cyprus .
He sold his land and brought the money to the apostles .
But a certain man named Ananias , with Sapphira his wife , sold a possession .
They kept back part of the money . His wife was also knowledgeable of the transaction . They brought part of the funds to the apostles .
Peter said : » Ananias , why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit , and to keep back part of the money from the land sale ?
While it remained , was it not your own ? And after it was sold , was it not in your power ? Why did you conceive this thing in your heart ? You have not lied to men , but to God . «
Hearing these words Ananias fell down and died . Great fear came over all those who heard these things .
The young men arose , covered him up , and carried him out , and buried him .
About three hours later , his wife , not knowing what was done , came in .
Peter said to her : » Tell me whether you sold the land for such a price ? « And she said : » Yes , we did . «
Then Peter said : » How is it that you have agreed together to put Jehovah’s Spirit to the test ? Look , those who buried your husband are at the door to carry you out . «
Then she fell down at his feet and died . The young men came in , and found her dead . They carried her out to be buried by her husband .
Great fear came upon the entire congregation who heard these things .
The apostles performed many wonders among the people . They were all with one accord in Solomon’s porch .
None of the rest dared to associate with them , but the people held them in high esteem .
More believers were added to the Lord , multitudes both of men and women .
They brought the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and cots in order that the shadow might fall on them when Peter passed by .
Crowds came from the cities near Jerusalem . They brought sick people and people with unclean spirits and everyone of them was healed .
Then the high priest rose up , and all those of the sect of the Sadducees who were with him were filled with zeal indignation .
They captured the apostles and put them in the common prison .
During the night God’s angel opened the prison doors , brought them out and said :
» Go stand in the temple and speak to the people all the sayings about this life . «
When they heard that , they entered into the temple early in the morning , and taught . But the high priest came , and those who were with him . He called the council together and all the senate of the children of Israel and sent to the prison to have them brought .
The officers did not find them in the prison when they came . So they returned and said ,
» We found the prison locked with the guards standing before the doors . When we opened it we did not find a man . «
When the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things , they doubted them . They wondered what this would come to .
Someone came to them and told them : » The men you put in prison are standing in the temple teaching the people . «
Then the captain with the officers brought them in without violence . They feared the people lest they should have been stoned .
They brought them before the council and the high priest asked them :
» Did we command you not to teach in this name ? Look , you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching , and are willing to bring this man’s blood upon us . «
Peter and the other apostles answered : » We must obey God rather than men .
» The God of our fathers raised up Jesus , whom you killed . You hanged him on a stake .
» God exalted him to his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior , to give repentance to Israel , and forgiveness of sins .
» We are witnesses of these things . The Holy Spirit , which God gave to those who obey him , also witnessed . «
When they heard that , they were cut to the heart , and took counsel to kill them .
One of the council , a Pharisee , named Gamaliel , a doctor of the law , had a reputation among all the people . He commanded to put the apostles outside for a while .
He said to them : » You men of Israel be careful what you intend to do to these men .
» Sometime ago Theudas claimed to be somebody . About four hundred men joined and obeyed him . He was killed and they finally dispersed .
» After this man Judas of Galilee rose in the days of the taxing , and drew away many people after him . He also perished and all who obeyed him dispersed .
» I tell you : Leave these men alone . If this message and this work are from men it will come to nothing .
» But if it is from God , you cannot overthrow it ; otherwise you may find yourselves fighting against God . «
They agreed with him and called the apostles . They beat them and commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus . Then they let them go .
They left the council and rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name .
They taught daily in the temple and in every house . They did not cease to teach and preach Jesus Christ .
The number of disciples increased at that time . A murmuring arose on the part of the Grecians against the Hebrews , because their widows were neglected in the daily distribution .
The twelve called the congregation of the disciples to them . They said : » It would not be right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of God and serve tables .
» Therefore brothers select seven men who have a good reputation . Men who are full of spirit and wisdom that we may appoint to take care of this business .
» We will give our attention to prayer and the ministry of the word . «
The idea pleased the whole congregation . They chose Stephen , a man full of faith and of Holy Spirit , and Philip , and Prochorus , and Nicanor , and Timon , and Parmenas , and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch ,
whom they set before the apostles . After they prayed , they laid their hands on them .
The word of God increased . The number of the disciples greatly multiplied in Jerusalem . Even a great number of priests became obedient to the faith .
Stephen , full of grace and power , did great wonders and miracles among the people .
Certain men arose from the synagogue . It was called the synagogue of the Libertines , Cyrenians , and Alexandrians . Some of them were from Cilicia and Asia . They argued with Stephen .
They were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spoke .
They secretly induced me to say : » We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses , and against God . «
They stirred up the people , the elders and the scribes , and pursued him . They caught him and brought him to the council .
They brought false witnesses , which said : » This man will not stop speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the law .
» We heard him say : ‘ This Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place , and will change the customs that Moses delivered to us . ’ «
All who sat in the council looked intently at him and saw his face was like the face of an angel .
The high priest asked : » Are these things so ? «
He said : » Men , brothers and fathers , listen ; The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia , before he lived in Haran .
» He said to him : ‘ Get out of your country and away from your relatives . Go to the land that I will show you .
» He went out of the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran . After his father died , God moved him to this land , where you now dwell .
» He gave him no inheritance in it , no , not so much as to set his foot on . Yet he promised that he would give it to him and his seed after him for a possession . This promise was made before he had a child .
» God spoke to this effect , that his seed would be alien residents in a strange land . They would enslave them , and mistreat them for four hundred years .
‘ » I will judge the nation to whom they shall be in bondage , ’ ’ said God , ‘ and after they will come serve me in this place . ’
» He gave him the covenant of circumcision . Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him the eighth day . Isaac became father to Jacob and Jacob fathered the twelve family heads .
» The family heads were jealous of Joseph and sold him as a slave into Egypt . However , God was with him .
» And God delivered him out of all his afflictions . He gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt . Pharaoh made him governor over Egypt and his entire house .
» A famine and great suffering came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan . Our fathers found no food .
« When Jacob heard there was food in Egypt , he sent our fathers on their first visit .
» The second time Joseph got acquainted with his brothers and Pharaoh was told about Joseph’s family .
» Then Joseph sent for his father Jacob and all his family , seventy-five people .
» Jacob went down into Egypt and died , he and our fathers .
» Their bodies were brought to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem .
» When the time of God’s promise to Abraham drew near , the people grew and multiplied in Egypt .
» Another king arose . He did not know Joseph .
» He dealt treacherously with our people and oppressed our fathers so that they cast out their young children and they did not survive .
» Moses was born then . He was divinely beautiful . He was nursed three months in his father’s house .
» And when he was cast out , Pharaoh’s daughter took him and nourished him as her own son .
» Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians , and was mighty in words and in deeds .
» When he was forty years old , it came into his heart to visit his brothers the children of Israel .
» Seeing one of them suffer wrong , he defended him , and avenged the oppressed one by killing the Egyptian .
» He supposed his brothers would understand how God by his hand would deliver them but they did not understand .
» The next day he appeared to them while they were fighting . He wanted to unite them and said , ‘ You are brothers . Why do you wrong one another ? ’
» The one who was treating his neighbor unjustly pushed him away , saying : ‘ Who made you our ruler and judge ?
‘ » Will you kill me as you did the Egyptian yesterday ? ’
» When he heard this talk Moses fled and became a stranger in the land of Median , where he became father to two sons .
» At the end of forty years , Jehovah’s angel appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sinai in a flame of fire in a bush .
When Moses saw it , he wondered at the sight . He drew near to look at it and the voice of Jehovah came to him .
» He said : I am the God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . Then Moses trembled and did not dare to look further .
» Jehovah said : Take the sandals from your feet for the place where you stand is holy ground .
» I have seen the affliction of my people in Egypt . I have heard their groaning and have come to deliver them . Come , I will send you into Egypt .
» This Moses whom they refused , saying : Who made you ruler and judge ? God sent him to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel that appeared to him in the bush .
» He brought them out . He showed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt , in the Red sea , and in the wilderness forty years .
» This is the Moses that said to the children of Israel , your God will raise up a prophet like me from your brothers .
» This one was with our father in the congregation in the wilderness . The angel spoke to him on Mount Sinai . He received the living oracles to give to us .
» Our fathers would not obey him . They sent him away , and in their hearts turned back again to Egypt .
» They said to Aaron : Make us gods to go in front of us . We do not know what happened to this Moses , who led us out of Egypt .
» They made a calf in those days , and offered sacrifice to the idol , and rejoiced in the works of their own hands .
» God turned , and gave them up to worship the host of heaven . It is written in the book of the prophets : O you house of Israel , have you offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness ?
» Yes , you took up the tabernacle of Moloch , and the star of your god Remphan . You made figures to worship them . I will carry you away beyond Babylon .
» Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness , as he had appointed , speaking to Moses , that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen .
» Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Joshua into the possession of the nations , whom God drove out before the face of our fathers , until the days of David ;
» Who found favor before God , and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob .
» But Solomon built him a house .
The most High does not dwell in houses made with hands as the prophet says ,
» Heaven is my throne , and earth is my footstool . What house will you build me ? Said Jehovah God . What is the place of my rest ?
» Did my hand make all these things ?
» You obstinate men who are uncircumcised in heart and ears . You always resist the Holy Spirit as your fathers did .
» Which of the prophets have your fathers not persecuted ? They killed those who announced in advance the coming of the righteous one whom you have betrayed and murdered .
» You have received the law by the disposition of angels and have not obeyed it . «
When they heard these things , they were cut to the heart . They gnashed their teeth at him .
Being full of the Holy Spirit , he gazed intently into heaven , and saw the glory of God , and Jesus standing at the right hand of God .
He said , » Behold , I see the heavens opened , and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God . «
Then they cried out with a loud voice , and stopped their ears , and ran upon him with one accord .
They threw him out of the city , and stoned him . And the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man’s feet . His name was Saul .
They stoned Stephen . He called out : » Lord Jesus , receive my spirit ! «
He kneeled down and cried with a loud voice : » Jehovah , do not charge this sin against them . « After saying this he fell asleep in death .
Saul agreed to his death . There was at that time a great persecution against the congregation at Jerusalem . All but the apostles were scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria .
Devout men buried Stephen and mourned him greatly .
Saul ravaged the congregation . He entered every house and dragged off men and women and put them in prison .
They who were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word .
Then Philip went to the city of Samaria , and preached Christ to them .
The people with one accord gave heed to those things Philip spoke , hearing and seeing the miracles he did .
Unclean spirits , crying with loud voices , came out of many who were possessed by them . Many who were taken with palsies and the lame were healed .
There was great joy in that city .
A certain man called Simon was in the same city . He used sorcery , and bewitched the people of Samaria , telling everyone that he was great .
They all listened to him , from the least to the greatest , saying : This man has great power from God .
They followed him because for a long time he astonished them with sorceries .
When they believed what Philip preached about the kingdom of God , and the name of Jesus Christ , they were baptized , both men and women .
Simon also believed . When he was baptized he continued with Philip , amazed by the miracles and signs he saw .
When the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God , they sent Peter and John to them .
Peter and John prayed for them , that they might receive the Holy Spirit .
They were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus but had not yet received the Spirit .
So they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit .
When Simon saw the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands , he offered them money .
Simon said : » Give me this power that on whomever I lay hands , he may receive the Holy Spirit . «
Peter said to him : » Your money will perish with you , because you think that the gift of God may be purchased with money .
» You have no part or share in this matter for your heart is not right in the sight of God .
» Repent of this wickedness , and pray to God , that the thought in your heart may be forgiven you .
» For I perceive that you are full of bitterness , and in the bond of iniquity . «
Simon answered : » Pray to God for me , that none of these things that you have spoken will happen to me . «
When they had testified and preached the word of Jehovah they returned to Jerusalem , and preached the good news in many villages of the Samaritans .
God’s angel said to Philip : » Arise , and go toward the south the way that goes from Jerusalem unto Gaza through the desert . «
He went and an Ethiopian eunuch government official , a man of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians , who had the charge of all her treasure , and had come to Jerusalem to worship .
He was returning and sitting in his chariot reading Isaiah the prophet .
The Spirit said to Philip : » Go near , and climb on this chariot . «
Philip ran to him , heard him read the prophet Isaiah , and said : » Do you understand what you are reading ? «
» How can I « , the eunuch said : » unless someone explains it to me ? « He invited Philip to come and sit with him .
The Scripture he read was this : » He was led as a sheep to the slaughter ; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer so he did not open his mouth .
» In his humiliation his judgment was taken away . Who will declare his generation ? For his life is taken from the earth . «
The eunuch asked Philip : » Please tell me of whom is the prophet talking about , himself or someone else ? «
Then Philip began at the same Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus .
On their way , they came to a body of water and the eunuch said , » See , here is water . What prevents me from getting baptized ? «
Philip said : » If you believe with all your heart , you may . « He answered : » I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God . «
He commanded the chariot to stop . They both went into the water , both Philip and the eunuch ; and he baptized him .
After they came out of the water God’s Spirit took Philip away . The eunuch did not see him again . He continued his journey rejoicing .
Philip was seen passing through Azotus . He preached in all the cities , until he came to Caesarea .
Saul was still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord . He went to the high priest .
He asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus , that if he found any there who belonged to The Way , men or women , he might bring them bound to Jerusalem .
As he journeyed to Damascus , suddenly a light from heaven shined around him .
He fell to the earth and heard a voice saying : » Saul , Saul ! Why do you persecute me ? «
» Who are you Lord ? « He asked . The Lord said : » I am Jesus whom you persecute .
» Get up and go into the city , and it will be told to you what you must do . «
The men who traveled with him stood speechless , hearing a voice , but seeing no man .
Saul got up from the ground . Even though he opened his eyes , he saw nothing . They led him by the hand into Damascus .
He went for three days without sight . He did not eat or drink .
The disciple Ananias was in Damascus . The Lord spoke to Ananias in a vision : » Ananias . « He replied : » Yes , I am here , Lord . «
The Lord said to him , » Arise , and go to the street called Straight , and inquire at the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus for he is praying .
» He has seen a man named Ananias in a vision . He came in and laid his hand on him that he might receive his sight . «
Ananias answered : » Lord , I have heard from many about this man , how much evil he has done to your holy ones at Jerusalem .
» He has authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name . «
The Lord said to him : » Be on your way . This man is a chosen vessel to bear my name to the people of the nations , and kings and the children of Israel .
» I will show him plainly how many things he must suffer for my name . «
Ananias went his way . He entered the house and put his hands on him and said , » Brother Saul , the Lord , even Jesus , that appeared to you along the road sent me , that you might receive your sight , and be filled with the Holy Spirit . «
Immediately something like scales fell from his eyes and he received sight . He got up and was baptized .
He ate and was strengthened . Saul spent several days with the disciples at Damascus .
He preached in the synagogues immediately . He preached Christ the Son of God .
All who heard him were amazed . They asked : » Is he the one who raised havoc with those who called on this name in Jerusalem ? Did he come for that purpose to take them as prisoners to the chief priests ? «
Saul increased in power and confounded the Jews living in Damascus , proving that this is the Christ .
After many days the Jews took counsel to kill him .
Saul learned about their plot against him . They watched the gates day and night to kill him .
During the night the disciples let him down by the wall in a basket .
When Saul came to Jerusalem he attempted to join the disciples . They were afraid of him and did not believe he was a disciple .
Barnabas led him to the apostles . He declared to them how he had seen the Lord in The Way , and that he had spoken to him , and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus .
He was with them coming in and going out of Jerusalem .
He spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus . He had a dispute with the Greek speaking Jews and they made attempts to kill him .
When the brothers detected this they brought him to Caesarea and sent him to Tarsus .
The congregations throughout all Judea , Galilee and Samaria , were built up . They walked in deep respect for Jehovah and were comforted by the Holy Spirit and continued to grow .
Peter traveled through all parts . He came to the holy ones at Lydda .
He found a man named Aeneas who lay in his bed for eight years . He was sick of the palsy .
Peter said to him : « Aeneas , Jesus Christ makes you whole ! Stand up and take your bed . « And he stood up immediately .
All who lived at Lydda on the Plain of Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord .
A disciple named Tabitha was at Joppa . Her name , when translated means Dorcas . This woman did many good works and gave gifts of mercy .
She was sick , and died . They washed her body and laid her in an upper chamber .
Since Lydda was near Joppa , and the disciples had heard that Peter was there , they sent two men to him requesting that he come to them quickly .
Peter went to them right a way . When he arrived they brought him into the upper chamber . All the widows stood by him weeping and showing the coats and garments that Dorcas made while she was with them .
Peter put them all outside , kneeled down , and prayed . He turned to the body and said : » Tabitha , rise ! « She opened her eyes . When she saw Peter , she sat up .
He gave her his hand and lifted her up . Then he called the holy ones and widows and presented her alive .
It became known throughout Joppa and many believed in the Lord .
He waited many days in Jappa with Simon a tanner .
There was a man in Caesarea called Cornelius , a centurion of the Italian Band .
He was a devout man who respected God with his entire household . He gave many gifts of mercy to the people and prayed to God always .
About the ninth hour of the day he clearly saw a vision . An angel of God came to him and said , » Cornelius . «
He looked at him and was afraid . » What is it , Lord ? « He replied . The angel said : » God hears your prayers and sees your gifts of mercy .
» Send men to Joppa to bring back Simon , whose surname is Peter :
» He is staying with a tanner named Simon whose house is by the sea . «
When the angel who spoke to Cornelius left , he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier who was his attendant .
He told them what happened and sent them to Joppa .
The next day they journeyed to the city . As they drew near , Peter went to the housetop to pray . It was about the sixth hour .
He became very hungry . While the meal was being prepared he fell into a trance .
He saw heaven opened , something like a great sheet lowered by the four corners was descending to the earth .
In it were all kinds of animals , reptiles and birds .
Peter heard a voice say : » Kill and eat . «
But Peter said : » No Lord for I have never eaten any thing that is defiled or unclean . «
The voice spoke to him again the second time : » You stop calling defiled that which God has cleansed . «
This happened a third time and immediately the sheet was taken up to heaven .
While Peter doubted in himself what this vision ment , behold , the men who were sent from Cornelius inquired for Simon’s house , and stood at the gate .
They called out and asked if Simon surnamed Peter lived there .
While Peter thought about the vision , the Spirit said to him : « Behold , three men seek you .
» Stand up and go down to greet them . Do not doubt for I have sent them .
Then Peter went down to the men who were sent to him from Cornelius . He said : » I am the one you are looking for . Why did you come ? «
They said : » We come from Cornelius the centurion , a righteous man who respects God . He has a good reputation among all the nation of the Jews . A holy angel told him to have you come to his house so he could hear what you have to say . «
He invited them in to be his guests . The next day Peter went away with them . Brothers accompanied them from Joppa .
The day after that they entered Caesarea . Cornelius expected them so he called his relatives and close friends to join him .
Cornelius met Peter and fell down at his feet with adoration for him .
» Stand up , « Peter said , as he lifted him up , » I am also a man . «
He talked with him and went in to find many people gathered .
He said to them : » You know that it is an unlawful thing for a man who is a Jew to keep company , or approach someone of another nation . But God revealed to me that I should not call any man defiled or unclean .
» Therefore I came to you without objection , as soon as I was sent for . I ask therefore for what intent you sent for me ? «
Cornelius replied , » Four days ago I was praying at this hour . It was the ninth hour and I prayed in my house . A man dressed in bright clothing stood before me .
» He said , ‘ Cornelius , your prayer is heard and your gifts of mercy are noticed in the sight of God .
‘ » Send to Joppa , and call Simon , whose surname is Peter . He lives in the house of the tanner named Simon by the sea . When he comes he will speak with you . ’
» Immediately I sent for you . You have done well for you have come . We are all present before God , to hear all things that are commanded to you from God . «
Peter opened his mouth , and said , » I truly perceive that God shows no partiality .
» In every nation he accepts every person who respects him and does what is right .
» You know the Word of God was sent to the children of Israel . He Jehovah God presented peace through the anointed Lord or Master of all , Jesus Christ .
» You know that message which began in Galilee and was published throughout all Judea , after the baptism that John preached .
God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power . Jesus went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil . God was with him .
» We are witnesses of all things that he did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem . They put him to death by hanging him on a stake .
» God raised him up the third day and made him visible .
» However , all the people did not see him . Witnesses who were previously chosen by God saw him . We who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead saw him .
» He commanded us to preach to the people . We testify that he was ordained by God to be the Judge of the living and the dead .
» All the prophets testify that through his name whoever believes in him will receive forgiveness of sins . «
Holy Spirit descended on all who heard the message Peter spoke .
Those circumcised believers who came with Peter were amazed that the gift of Holy Spirit was also poured out on the people of the nations .
They heard them speak with tongues , and magnify God . Then Peter responded :
» Can any man keep these people from being baptized with water ? They have received the Holy Spirit as we have . «
He ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ . Then they asked him to stay for a few days .
The apostles and brothers in Judea heard that the people of the nations also received the word of God .
When Peter went to Jerusalem , those who favored circumcision argued with him .
They said : » You went to the uncircumcised and ate with them . «
Peter started at the beginning and explained what happened .
» I was in the city of Joppa praying . In a trance I saw a vision . A vessel descended like a great sheet . It let down from heaven by four corners and it came to me .
» I looked in it and saw four-footed animals of the earth , wild beasts , creeping things and birds of the air .
» I heard a voice say to me , ‘ Get up Peter slaughter and eat . ’
» I said , ‘ No Lord , for nothing defiled or unclean has at any time entered into my mouth . ’
» The voice answered me again from heaven , ‘ Do not call defiled what God has cleansed ! ’
» This happened three times . Then everything was pulled up again into heaven .
» At that moment there were three men who were sent from Caesarea to me at the house where I was .
» The Spirit told me to go with them and not to doubt them . These six brothers accompanied me when we entered the man’s house .
» He showed us how he had seen an angel in his house that stood and said to him , ‘ Send men to Joppa , and call for Simon , whose surname is Peter . ’
» He will bring you a message so that you and your household shall be saved .
» When I spoke the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as it was in the beginning .
» Then I remembered what the Lord said , ‘ John indeed baptized with water . However you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit . ’
» Since God gave them the same gift as he gave to us who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ , who was I that I could oppose God ? «
When they heard this they objected no more and praised God , saying : » God has granted the people of the nations repentance to life . «
Those who were scattered abroad because of the persecution of Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia , Cyprus , and Antioch , preaching the word only to the Jews .
Some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene . When they came to Antioch they spoke to the Greeks and preached the Lord Jesus .
The hand Spirit of God was with them . A great number believed , and turned to the Lord .
News of these things came to the ears of the congregation in Jerusalem . They sent Barnabas that he should go as far as Antioch .
When he arrived he saw the grace of God and was glad . He exhorted them all to remain true to the Lord as their only purpose of heart .
For he was a good man full of Holy Spirit and of faith . Then many people were added to the Lord .
Then Barnabas departed to Tarsus to seek Saul .
When he found him , he brought him to Antioch . They met with the congregation for a whole year . They taught many people . The disciples were first called Christians in Antioch .
Prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch at that time .
One of them was named Agabus . He indicated through the Spirit that a great famine was about to come on the entire earth . He said it would come to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar .
The disciples , every man according to his ability , determined to send relief to the brothers in Judea .
They sent it to the elders through Barnabas and Saul .
At that time Herod the king mistreated those of the congregation .
He killed James the brother of John with a sword .
He saw that it pleased the Jews so he captured Peter also . This happened during the feast of unleavened bread .
When he apprehended him , he put him in prison . He turned him over to four squads of four soldiers each to guard him . After Passover he would be presented to the people .
Peter was kept in prison . Prayer was made without ceasing by the congregation to God for him .
It was the night before Herod was to bring him to trial . Peter was sleeping between two soldiers . He was bound with two chains . Sentries stood guard at the prison door .
Suddenly God’s angel came to him . A light shined in the prison . He struck Peter on the side , and woke him up saying : » Get up quickly . « And his chains fell off of his hands .
The angel said : » Dress yourself and put on sandals . Put on your coat and follow me . « So Peter did as he was told .
Peter followed him out of the prison . He did not know what the angel was doing was really happening . He thought he saw a vision .
They went past the first and second guard to the Iron Gate that leads to the city . The gate opened and went out on the street . The angel then departed from him .
Peter came to himself and he said : » Now I know for sure that God sent his angel and delivered me out of the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the Jews . «
After he thought about what happened he went to the house of Mary the mother of John , surnamed Mark . Many were gathered there to pray .
Peter knocked on the door and a young woman named Rhoda answered .
When she recognized Peter’s voice she was so overjoyed she ran back into the house to tell others he was there . She forgot to open the door for him .
They said to her : » You are mad . « But she kept insisting that it was so . Then they said : » It must be his angel . «
But Peter continued knocking . When they opened the door , and saw him , they were astonished .
Peter motioned for them to be quiet . Then he told them how God brought him out of the prison . He said : » Tell James and the brothers . « Then he went away to another place .
When day came the soldiers were disturbed by what happened to Peter .
Herod had a thorough search made for him and could not find him . He cross examined the guards and ordered that they be executed . Herod went from Judea to Caesarea to stay for a while .
Herod highly disagreed with them at Tyre and Sidon . But they finally came to an agreement . They secured the support of Blastus a trusted personal servant of the king . They desired peace because their country was supported by the king’s country .
Dressed in royal apparel , Herod delivered a public address to the people on a special day .
The people shouted : » It is the voice of a god , and not of a man . «
Immediately the angel of God killed him , because he did not give God the glory . He was eaten by worms and died .
The word of God increased and spread .
Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had completed their mission . They took with them John , surnamed Mark .
There were prophets and teachers in the congregation at Antioch . This included : Barnabas , and Simeon called Niger , and Lucius of Cyrene , and Manaen , who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch , and Saul .
As they ministered to God , and fasted , the Holy Spirit said : » Set Barnabas and Saul apart for the work I have called them . «
After they fasted and prayed , they laid their hands on them and sent them away .
Being sent by Holy Spirit , they went to Seleucia . From there they sailed to Cyprus .
They preached the Word of God in the synagogues of the Jews at Salamis . John was also there as an attendant .
They traveled the whole island until they came to Paphos . There they found Barjesus . He was a sorcerer , a false prophet and a Jew .
He was with the deputy of the country , Sergius Paulus , a prudent man , who called for Barnabas and Saul , and desired to hear the word of God .
But Elymas the sorcerer opposed them , seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith .
Then Saul , who also is called Paul , filled with the Holy Spirit , set his eyes on him ,
And said : » You child of the devil , full of all subtlety and mischief , you enemy of all righteousness , will you not cease to pervert the right ways of Jehovah ?
» Look Jehovah’s hand is on you . You will be blind and not see the sun for a season . « Immediately there fell on him a mist and darkness . He went about seeking some to lead him by the hand .
When he saw what was done the deputy believed . He was astonished at the teaching of God .
Paul and his company put out to sea from Paphos . They went to Perga in Pamphylia . John left them to return to Jerusalem .
When they left Perga , they went to Antioch in Pisidia . They went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day , and sat down .
After the public reading of the law and the prophets the synagogue officials sent to them , saying : » You men and brothers if you have a message of encouragement for the people speak . «
Then Paul stood up gestured with his hand and said : » Men of Israel , and you who reverence God , listen . «
» The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers , and exalted the people when they lived as strangers in the land of Egypt . He brought them out of Egypt with his great strength .
» He cared for them and endured their bad conduct in the wilderness for forty years .
» He destroyed seven nations in Canaan and gave their land to his people as their inheritance .
» Then he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet . This took about four hundred and fifty years .
» Afterward they desired a king . God gave Saul the son of Kish , a man of the tribe of Benjamin , to them for forty years .
» When he removed him , he made David their king . He testified about him when he said : I found David the son of Jesse is a man after my own heart . He will do my will .
» God brought the Savior Jesus to Israel from this man’s descendants .
» Before Jesus came John preached the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel .
» As John accomplished his purpose he asked : Who do you think I am ? I am not that one . One comes after me whose shoes I am not worthy to untie .
» Men and brothers , children of Abraham , and you of the nations who respect God , the message of salvation is sent to you .
» The people of Jerusalem and their rulers did not know Jesus . They fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath when they condemned Jesus .
» They found no grounds for the death sentence for him . Yet they asked Pilate to put him to death .
» When they had fulfilled all that was written about him , they took him down from the stake , and laid him in a tomb .
» But God raised him from the dead :
» Those who came with him from Galilee to Jerusalem saw him . They are his witnesses to the people .
» We tell you good news . It is God’s promise to the fathers .
» God has fulfilled this promise to their children by resurrecting Jesus . Just as it is written in the second psalm : You are my Son , today I have become your father .
» He raised him up from the dead , never to decay . It is stated in these words : I will give you the sure blessings promised David .
» He said in another psalm : You will not allow your Holy One to see decay .
» After David served his own generation by doing the will of God he died and was buried with his fathers . His body decayed .
» But he Jesus , whom God raised again , saw no decay .
» You should know , men and brothers that it is through this man Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you .
» Through him all who believe are justified from all things . You could not be justified through the Law of Moses .
Beware that what the prophets said does not happen to you .
» Look among the nations , watch , and be amazed . Though you are told you will not believe the work I do today . «
When the Jews left the synagogue the people asked for this message to be preached to them the next Sabbath .
When the congregation dismissed , many followed Paul and Barnabas . They urged them to continue in the grace of God .
Nearly the entire city gathered the next Sabbath day to hear the word of God .
When the Jews saw the crowds they were filled with envy . They spoke against those things Paul spoke . They contradicted and blasphemed him .
Paul and Barnabas became very bold , and said : » It was necessary that the Word of God should first be spoken to you . But seeing you reject it you judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life ! Therefore we turn to the people of the nations .
» Jehovah commanded us with these words : I appoint you as a light to the nations . My salvation will come to the ends of the earth . «
And when the people of the nations heard this , they were glad , and glorified the word of God . As many as were receptive to eternal life believed .
The word of God Greek : kurios : God was published throughout the entire region .
The Jews incited the devout and honorable women and the leading men of the city . They caused persecution against Paul and Barnabas , and expelled them from their coasts .
So they shook the dust from their feet against them , and went to Iconium .
The disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit .
Paul and Barnabas entered the synagogue of the Jews at Iconium . There they spoke to a great crowd of Jews and Greeks who became believers .
The unbelieving Jews stirred up the people of the nations and poisoned their minds against the brothers .
The apostles stayed there for a long time . They spoke boldly by the authority of God who proved that their message about his grace was true by giving them the power to perform miracles and wonders .
The people of the city were divided . Some were for the Jews and others for the apostles .
Then some of the people of the nations and Jews , together with their leaders , decided to mistreat the apostles and stone them .
They knew about it and fled to Lystra and Derbe , cities of Lycaonia , and to the country around them .
They preached the good news there , too .
A man with crippled feet sat in Lystra . He had never walked for he was lame from birth .
He heard Paul speaking . Paul looked intently at him , and seeing that he had faith to be healed ,
said with a loud voice : » Stand up on your feet ! « And he leaped up and walked .
Seeing what Paul did , the crowd lifted up their voice , saying in Lycaonian : » The gods have come down to us , becoming like men . «
They called Barnabas , Jupiter ; and Paul , Mercurius , because he was the chief speaker .
Then the priest of Jupiter whose temple was there in the city , brought cattle and garlands to the gates , and would have done sacrifice with the people .
When the apostles , Barnabas and Paul , heard of it , they ripped their clothes , and ran in among the people .
They said : » Sirs , why do you do these things ? We are only men like you . We bring you good news . You should turn from these worthless things to the living God . He is the God who made heaven and earth , the sea and all things .
» In the past he let all nations to walk in their own ways .
» He has not left himself without witness . For he did good and gave us rain from heaven , and fruitful seasons , filling our hearts with food and gladness . «
Even with these words they found it hard to keep the crowd from sacrificing to them .
Jews from Antioch and Iconium took control of the crowd . They persuaded the people to stone Paul . Then they threw him out of the city , supposing him to be dead .
The disciples gathered around him and he stood up . They went into the city and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe .
After they preached the good news to that city and taught many , they returned again to Lystra , Iconium , and Antioch .
They strengthened the disciples and encouraged them to continue in the faith . They said , » We must enter the kingdom of God through much tribulation . «
When they had ordained elders in every congregation they prayed with fasting . They commended them to God , on whom they believed .
After they passed through Pisidia , they came to Pamphylia .
After they had preached the word in Perga they went down into Attalia .
They sailed to Antioch , where they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work they completed .
The congregation gathered and reported all God had done with them how he had opened the door of faith to the nations .
They stayed with the disciples for a long time .
Some men came down from Judea to teach the brothers . They said : » You cannot be saved unless you become circumcised according to the custom of Moses . «
Paul and Barnabas had an intense harsh dispute and debate with them . They concluded that Paul , Barnabas , and others should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders to settle this question .
The congregation sent them on their way . They passed through Phoenicia and Samaria , declaring the conversion of the nations . They brought great joy to all the brothers .
Then they went to Jerusalem where the apostles and elders and congregation greeted them . They declared all the things that God had done for them .
The believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stated : » It is needed to circumcise them and to command them to keep the Law of Moses . «
The apostles and elders came together to consider this matter .
After much discussion Peter got up and said : » Men and brothers you know that God made a choice among us , that I would preach the good news to the nations that they may hear and believe .
» God knows their hearts and showed that he accepted them by giving them Holy Spirit just as he did to us .
» He made no distinction between them and us and purified their hearts by faith .
» Why do you test God by placing a yoke upon the neck of the disciples , one that our fathers were not able to bear ?
» We believe we are saved through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , as they also are . «
The crowd kept silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul . They declared the miracles and wonders God performed through them among the people of the nations .
When they finished talking James said : » Brothers listen to me :
» Simeon declared how God first visited the nations to take out of them a people for his name .
» The words of the prophets agree to this for it is written :
» I will return and will build again the tabernacle of David , which has fallen down . I will rebuild its ruins . I will restore it .
» That the rest of mankind might seek after Jehovah , and all the nations , upon whom my name is called , Jehovah said , who is doing these things .
» Known to God are all his works from the beginning of the world .
» Therefore it is my decision not to trouble those of the nations who have turned to God .
» We should write to them that they should abstain from things polluted by idols , from fornication , from things strangled and from blood .
» Moses has been preached in the synagogues from old times until now every Sabbath day . «
The apostles and elders along with the whole congregation desired to send chosen men to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas ; namely , Judas surnamed Barsabas , and Silas , leading men among the brothers .
They wrote letters as follows : » The apostles , elders and brothers send greeting to the brothers who are of the nations in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia .
» Since we have heard , that certain ones who went out from us have troubled you with speeches , subverting you , saying : You must be circumcised , and keep the law . We gave no such commandment !
» It seemed good to us , being assembled with one accord , to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul .
» These men have endangered their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ .
» We have sent therefore Judas and Silas , who shall also tell you the same things in person .
» For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit , and to us , to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things .
» You should abstain from meats offered to idols , and from blood , and from things strangled , and from fornication . If you keep yourselves from these you will do well . Farwell best wishes . «
So when they were dismissed , they came to Antioch and when they had gathered the crowd together , they delivered the letter .
When they read it they rejoiced over the encouragement .
Judas and Silas , being prophets , said much to encourage and strengthen the brothers .
After they stayed there a while in peace , the brothers sent them back to the apostles .
It pleased Silas to stay there .
Paul and Barnabas stayed at Antioch , teaching and preaching the word of God , with many others also .
After time passed Paul said to Barnabas : » Let us go again and visit our brothers in every city where we have preached the Word of God , and see how they are doing . «
Barnabas decided to take John , whose surname was Mark , with them .
Paul did not think it a good idea to take him with them . So he left them at Pamphylia .
Their disagreement was so great between them that they parted company . So Barnabas took Mark , and sailed to Cyprus .
Paul chose Silas , and departed , being entrusted by the brothers to the grace of God .
He went through Syria and Cilicia , strengthening the congregations .
Paul arrived at Derbe and Lystra where he saw a disciple named Timothy . He was the son of a Jewish woman , and his father was a Greek .
The brothers at Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him .
Paul wanted to have him travel with him . So he had him circumcised because of the Jews who were in the area . For they knew that his father was a Greek .
They went through the towns and delivered to the believers the rules decided upon by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem . They told them to obey those rules .
The congregations were made stronger in the faith and grew in numbers every day .
The Holy Spirit did not let them preach the message in the province of Asia . So they traveled through the region of Phrygia and Galatia .
When they reached the border of Mysia , they tried to go into the province of Bithynia , but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them .
They traveled through Mysia and went to Troas .
Paul had a vision that night . In it he saw a Macedonian standing and pleading with him , » Come over to Macedonia and help us ! «
After Paul had this vision , we got ready to leave for Macedonia . We decided that God had called us to preach the good news to the people there .
We left by ship from Troas and sailed to Samothrace , and the next day to Neapolis .
From there we went inland to Philippi , a city of the first district of Macedonia . It is also a Roman colony . We spent several days there .
On the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to the river where we thought there was a place of prayer . We sat down and spoke to the women who gathered there .
A woman named Lydia who was a seller of purple came from Thyatira . She worshipped God because God opened her heart to listen to the things spoken by Paul .
When she and her household were baptized she came to us saying , » If you judge me to be faithful to God , come to my house , and stay there . « She absolutely insisted that we come .
A young woman who had a spirit of divination met us as we were going to the place of prayer . She brought her masters much gain by soothsaying .
She followed Paul and cried out : » These men are servants of the Most High God , who proclaim to you the way of salvation . «
She did this for many days . This troubled Paul . So he turned and said to the spirit , » I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her ! « And it came out that very hour .
When her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone , they grabbed Paul and Silas , and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers .
They took them to the magistrates and said : » These men , being Jews , cause great trouble in our city .
» They offer customs that it is not lawful for us to receive , or to observe , being Romans . «
The crowd rose up against them . The magistrates ripped their garments off them , and commanded to beat them with rods .
After they were severely beaten , they threw them into prison , charging the jailor to keep them safe .
Receiving this command he threw them into the inner prison , and fastened their feet in the stocks .
Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God at midnight . The prisoners were listening to them .
Suddenly there was a massive earthquake . It was so great the foundations of the prison-house were shaken . All the doors were opened and everyone’s bands came off .
The jailor , who was roused out of sleep and saw the prison doors open , he drew his sword and was about to kill himself , supposing that the prisoners had escaped .
Paul cried with a loud voice : » Do not harm yourself for we are all here . «
The jailer called for lights . He rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas .
He brought them out and asked : » Sirs , what must I do to be saved ? «
They said : » Believe in the Lord Jesus , and you will be saved , you and your house . «
They spoke the Word of God to him and those in his house .
That very hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds . Then he and all his family were baptized .
He took them to his house and fed them . They rejoiced along with his entire house , having believed in God .
The next day the magistrates sent the officers saying : » Let those men go . «
The jailor reported the words to Paul , saying : » The magistrates have sent to let you go . Therefore go in peace . «
Paul said to them : » They have beaten us publicly uncondemned , men who are Romans , and have thrown us into prison . Do they now throw us out privately ? No I say , but let them come in person to bring us out . «
The officers reported these words to the magistrates . They feared when they heard that they were Romans .
They personally came to them and brought them out . They asked them to go away from the city .
They left the prison and entered the house of Lydia . When they saw the brothers they comforted them and then left .
They passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia and came to Thessalonica , where there was a synagogue of the Jews .
Paul went in , for it was his custom . He reasoned with them from the Scriptures for three Sabbath days .
He explained and proved that Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead . And that Jesus is the Messiah .
Some of them were convinced believed and joined with Paul and Silas . A large crowd of the devout Greeks and of the prominent women also joined .
The Jews were moved with jealousy so they gathered bad people who organized a crowd for a riot . They assaulted the house of Jason in order to bring them out to the crowd .
When they did not find them they dragged Jason and other brothers before the rulers of the city . They said : » These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also . «
Jason welcomed them . They all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar , saying that there is another king , Jesus .
The crowd and the rulers of the city were troubled when they heard these things .
They made Jason post bond and they let them go .
The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea . When they arrived there they went to the synagogue of the Jews .
The Bereans were nobler than those in Thessalonica because they received the word with all readiness of mind and examined the Scriptures daily to see if what Paul told them was true .
Many of them believed . So did the prominent Greek women and prominent men .
When the Jews of Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God at Beroea , they went there and stirred up the crowds and caused trouble .
The brothers immediately sent Paul to the sea . Silas and Timothy stayed at Beroea .
Those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens . He sent orders to Silas and Timothy that they should come to him as soon as possible .
Paul waited for them at Athens . His spirit was irritated within him when he saw the city full of idols .
So he reasoned in the synagogue with Jews and devout persons . He went to the marketplace every day with those who would meet with him .
The Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him . Some said : What is this babbler saying ? Others : He seems to be advocating strange gods because he preached Jesus and the resurrection .
They took hold of him and brought him to the Areopagus . They said , » May we know what is this new teaching ?
» You bring strange ideas to our ears . We want to know what these things mean . «
The Athenians and the strangers who lived there spent their time doing nothing else except talking about and listening to new ideas .
Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus , and said : » Men of Athens , in all things , I perceive that you are very religious .
« As I passed along , and observed the objects of your worship , I found also an altar with this inscription : » To An Unknown God . « What you worship as unknown , this I will proclaim to you .
» The God that made the world and all things in it is the Lord of heaven and earth . He does not live in temples made with hands .
» Men’s hands do not serve him as if he needed anything . He gives life and breath to all .
» From one person he made every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth . He determined their appointed seasons , and the bounds of their habitation .
» God did this so man could seek him and might find him . He is not far from each one of us .
» In him we live , and move , and have our existence . Your own poets have said : For we are also his offspring .
» Being then the offspring of God , we should not think that the divine being is like gold , or silver , or stone , a device made by man’s design or skill .
» God overlooked the times of ignorance ; but now he commands men everywhere to repent .
» He has established a day time in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man Jesus whom he has ordained . Of that he gives proof of this to all men by raising him from the dead . «
Some mocked when they heard about the resurrection of the dead . Yet others said : » We will hear you again concerning this « .
Thus Paul went out from among them .
Some men joined themselves to him and believed . Included among the believers were Dionysius the Areopagite , a woman named Damaris , and others with them .
After this Paul left Athens to go to Corinth .
There he found a Jew named Aquila , a native of Pontus who is currently from Italy with his wife Priscilla . Claudius commanded all the Jews to leave Rome . So he came to them .
He was of the same trade as Paul . So he stayed with them and worked at their tentmaker trade .
He reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath , and persuaded Jews and Greeks .
Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia . He witnessed to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah .
When they opposed Paul and treated him abusively he shook out his garment and said to them : » Your blood is upon your own heads . I am clean . From now on I will go to the people of the nations . «
He left the synagogue and went next door to the house of a man named Titus Justus , one who worshiped God .
Crispus , the ruler of the synagogue , believed in the Lord and so did his household . Many of the Corinthians who heard and believed were baptized .
The Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision : » Do not be afraid , but speak . Do not keep silent !
» I am with you and no man will harm you . I have many people in this city . «
He lived there a year and six months teaching the word of God to them .
When Gallio was proconsul of Achaia , the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat .
They said : » This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law . «
Paul was about to speak when Gallio said to the Jews : » If you Jews were about to complain about some crime it would be reasonable for me to listen to you .
» But it involves questions about words and names in your own law so look to it yourselves . I will not be judge of these matters . «
He drove them from the court .
They all grabbed Sosthenes , the ruler of the synagogue , and beat him before the court . Gallio did not care about this .
Paul stayed many days . Then he left the brothers and sailed for Syria . Also with Paul were Priscilla and Aquila . Paul clipped this hair short in Cenchreae because of a vow .
They traveled to Ephesus where he left them . Paul entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews .
When they asked him to stay longer he declined .
» I will return again to you if it is God’s will , « Paul said . Then he set sail from Ephesus .
When he landed at Caesarea , he greeted the congregation and traveled to Antioch .
After spending some time there he departed through the region of Galatia , and Phrygia strengthening all the disciples .
A Jew named Apollos came to Ephesus . He was an Alexandrian who had a comprehensive knowledge of the scriptures and spoke eloquently .
This man had been instructed in God’s way . Being fervent in spirit he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus , knowing only the baptism of John .
He spoke boldly in the synagogue . But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him , they invited him home and explained God’s word more accurately .
When he decided to travel to Achaia , the brothers encouraged him . They wrote to the disciples to receive him . When he arrived he was a great help to those who by grace believed .
He powerfully refuted the Jews in public debate showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ .
While Apollos was at Corinth , Paul passed through the upper country to Ephesus , and found some disciples .
He said to them : » Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed ? « They said : » We have never even heard of a Holy Spirit . «
Paul asked : » What kind of baptism did you get ? « They replied : » It was the baptism John taught . «
Paul said : » John baptized with the baptism of repentance . He told the people they should believe in Jesus , the one who came after John . «
When they heard this , they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus .
Paul laid his hands on them and Holy Spirit came upon them . They spoke with tongues and prophesied .
There were twelve men in all .
He entered the synagogue and spoke boldly reasoning and persuading about the kingdom of God . He did this for three months .
Some were obstinate and publicly maligned The Way before the crowds . He departed from them , and separated the disciples , reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus .
This continued for two years so that all who lived in this part of Asia heard the word of the Lord , both Jews and Greeks .
God did special miracles by the hands of Paul .
Handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched his body were put on the sick and the evil spirits went away .
Some Jews went around driving out evil spirits saying : » In the name of Jesus whom Paul preaches I command you to come out ! «
And there were seven sons of Sceva , a Jew , and a chief priest , who did this .
The evil spirit answered and said to them : » Jesus I know , and Paul I know , but who are you ? «
The man who had the evil spirit jumped on them , and overpowered them . He gave them such a beating that they fled out of that house naked and wounded .
This became known to all both Jews and Greeks , who lived at Ephesus . They were all afraid . The name of the Lord Jesus was magnified .
Many of the believers confessed openly about the evil things they had done .
Many of those who practiced magical arts brought their books and burned them in the sight of everyone . When they totaled the value of them it came to about fifty thousand pieces of silver .
The word of God kept on growing and prevailed .
After this ended Paul was directed in the spirit to go to Jerusalem after he passed through Macedonia and Achaia . He said : » After I have been there , I must also see Rome . «
He sent two of his helpers Timothy and Erastus to Macedonia . He stayed in Asia for a while .
A great disturbance occurred about The Way .
A man named Demetrius , a silversmith made silver shrines of Diana . He brought a lot of business to the craftsmen .
They gathered together along with similar related workmen , and said : » Sirs , You know we receive a good income from this business .
» You see and hear that Paul , in Ephesus and throughout all Asia , has persuaded and turned away many people . He says that man-made gods are no gods at all .
» There is danger that our trade will lose its good name . The temple of the great goddess Artemis Diana would then become useless . The goddess who is worshiped in all Asia would be robbed of her divine majesty . «
When they heard this they were filled with anger . They shouted : » Great is Artemis of the Ephesians . «
The city was filled with the confusion . They rushed with one accord into the theatre and seized Gaius and Aristarchus , men of Macedonia , Paul’s companions in travel .
Paul wanted to enter the theatre with the people but his disciples would not permit it .
Some of the officials and his friends sent him a message begging him not to enter the theatre .
Some cried one thing and others another for the crowd was in confusion . Most of them did not know why they assembled .
The crowd of Jews thrust Alexander forward . Alexander motioned with his hand and wanted to make a defense to the people .
They perceived that he was a Jew and all with one voice shouted for two hours : » Great is Artemis of the Ephesians . «
The city recorder quieted the crowd . He said : » You men of Ephesus , what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of the great Artemis , and of the image which fell down from Jupiter ?
» Seeing that these things are indisputable it is fitting that you keep calm and do nothing rash .
» You brought these men , who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess .
» If Demetrius and the craftsmen that are with him have a grievance against any man , the courts are open , and there are judges . Let them accuse one another .
» But if you seek anything about other matters , it shall be settled in the regular assembly .
» For indeed we are in danger to be charged with rioting sedition because of today’s events . We would not be able to account for this ruckus for there is no reason for it . «
When he finished speaking he dismissed the assembly .
After the uproar ceased Paul sent for the disciples . He encouraged them . Then he left for Macedonia .
He went to Greece after traveling through the area giving encouragement .
After three months he set sail for Syria . He decided to return through Macedonia . He left there because the Jews formed a plot against him .
Those who accompanied him as far as Asia : Sopater of Beroea , the son of Pyrrhus ; and of the Thessalonians , Aristarchus and Secundus ; and Gaius of Derbe , and Timothy ; and of Asia , Tychicus and Trophimus .
They left early and were waiting for us at Troas .
We sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread . Five days later we met them at Troas , where we stayed seven days .
On the first day of the week , when we were gathered together to break bread , Paul spoke to them . Intending to depart the next morning he prolonged his speech until midnight .
There were many lights in the upper chamber where we gathered .
A young man named Eutychus sat in the window . He was very sleepy . Paul’s talk was long and he fell asleep . He fell down from the third story , and was taken up dead .
Paul went down and fell on him . He embraced him and said : » Do not be troubled for he lives . «
He went up and they broke bread and ate . He talked with them a long time until morning . Then he left .
The people took the young man home alive for they were greatly comforted .
We went ahead to the ship and set sail for Assos . We intended to take Paul on board for he had arranged to go there on foot .
He met us at Assos and journeyed to Mitylene .
We sailed from there to Chios and then to Samos . One day later we went to Miletus .
Paul decided to sail past Ephesus so he might not spend time in Asia . He was in a hurry to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost .
At Miletus he sent to Ephesus , and called the elders of the congregation to him .
When they arrived he said : » You know from the first day that I set foot in Asia , I was with you all the time ,
serving the Lord with all lowliness of mind , and with tears , and with trials that came on me by the plots of the Jews .
» I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable , and teaching you publicly , and from house to house .
» I witnessed to both Jews and to Greeks about repentance toward God , and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ .
» I am compelled by the spirit to go to Jerusalem , not knowing the things that will happen to me there .
» Holy Spirit warns me that in every city , prison and hardships are facing me there .
» I do not consider my life of any account . It is not dear to me so that I may finish the race , and I may accomplish the ministry I received from the Lord Jesus , to preach the good news of the grace of God .
» I know all of you and have preached the kingdom with you . But you will not see me again .
» I declare to you today that I am innocent of the blood of all men .
» I did not shrink from telling you the entire will of God .
» Be on guard for yourselves and the flock that the Holy Spirit has made you overseers . Feed the Congregation of God that he purchased with the blood of his own Son .
» I know that after my departing grievous wolves will enter in among you , not sparing the flock .
» Such men will arise from among you speaking perverse things to draw away the disciples after them .
» Be on guard ! Remember I did not cease for three years to admonish you day and night with tears .
» Now I commend you to God , and to the word of his grace . This is able to build you up , and to give you the inheritance among all them that are sanctified .
» I coveted no man’s silver , or gold , or clothes .
» You know that my own hands ministered to my necessities , and to those who were with me .
» In all things I gave you an example . You by laboring should help the weak . Remember the words of the Lord Jesus : It is more blessed to give than to receive . «
When he had spoken he kneeled down and prayed with them all .
They all wept profusely , and fell on Paul’s neck and kissed him . embraced him hugged him
What grieved them most was his statement that they would not see him again . They accompanied him to the ship .
After we parted from them we set sail with a straight course to Cos . The next day we went to Rhodes and then to Patara .
We went aboard a ship sailing to Phoenicia .
We passed to the south of Cyprus and sailed to Syria . We landed at Tyre where the ship unloaded it’s cargo .
Having found the disciples , we stayed there seven days . Guided by the Spirit the disciples urged Paul not to go to Jerusalem .
When the time came we left there and went on our journey . All the disciples , their wives and children , accompanied us out of the city . We knelt down on the beach and prayed , and said goodbye .
We went on board the ship as they returned home .
We traveled from Tyre to Ptolemais where the brothers greeted us and we stayed with them one day .
The next morning we left for Caesarea where we entered the house of Philip the evangelist and one of the seven .
Now this man had four virgin daughters , who prophesied .
As we stayed there several days , a prophet came from Judea , named Agabus .
Coming to us he took Paul’s belt and bound his own feet and hands . He said : » The Holy Spirit says , So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owns this belt , and shall deliver him into the hands of the nations . «
When we heard this everyone pleaded with Paul not to go to Jerusalem .
Why do you weep and break my heart ? Paul answered : » For I am ready not to be bound only , but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus . «
He would not be dissuaded . So we ceased , saying : The will of God be done !
We packed our baggage and went to Jerusalem .
The disciples from Caesarea brought us to the home of Mnason of Cyprus , an early disciple , with whom we stayed .
The brothers in Jerusalem received us gladly .
The following day Paul went with us to James and the elders .
After Paul greeted them he reported in detail what God had done among the nations through his ministry .
Those who heard it glorified God . They said to him : » You see brother , how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed . They are all zealous for the law .
» They have been informed concerning you , that you teach all the Jews who are among the nations to forsake Moses . You tell them not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the customs .
» What shall we do ? They will certainly hear that you are here .
Do what we tell you . We have four men who have taken a vow .
Take these men and join in on their purification rites . Let them shave their heads . All will know there is no truth in the things they have heard about you , that you walk orderly and keep the law .
Concerning those of the nations who have believed , we write : they should keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols , and from blood , and from what is strangled , and from fornication .
Then Paul took the men and became purified with them . They went into the temple , declaring the fulfillment of the days of purification , until the offering was offered for every one of them .
When the seven days were almost over , the Jews from Asia , when they saw him in the temple stirred up the entire crowd and laid hands on him .
They shouted : » Men of Israel , help ! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people , and the law , and this place ; and moreover he brought Greeks also into the temple , and defiled this holy place . «
They had previously been with him in the city Trophimus the Ephesian , whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the Temple .
The entire city was aroused , and the people ran together from all directions . They laid hold on Paul and dragged him out of the Temple . Immediately the doors were shut .
They were seeking to kill him when tidings came to the military commander of the band that all Jerusalem was in confusion .
At once he took soldiers and centurions and ran down to the crowd . When they saw the military commander and the soldiers they quit beating Paul .
Then the military commander came near and laid hold on him . He commanded that he be bound with two chains . He asked who he was and what he had done .
Some in the crowd shouted one thing and some another . The commander could not find out the facts because of the uproar so he commanded him to be brought into the barracks .
Paul reached the steps . The violence of the mob was so great he had to be carried by the soldiers .
The mob followed closely and shouted : » Away with him ! «
And as Paul was about to be brought into the barracks , he said to the commander , » Might I say something to you ? « He replied : » Do you know Greek ?
» Are you the Egyptian who started a revolt and led four thousand assassins into the desert ? «
But Paul said , » I am a Jew , of Tarsus in Cilicia , a citizen of no ordinary city and I request that you allow me to speak to the people . «
The commander gave permission so Paul stood on the stairs , motioned to the people . When there was silence he spoke to them in the Hebrew language , saying :
» Men , brothers and fathers , hear my defense to you now . «
They heard him speak in the Hebrew tongue and became quiet .
» I am a Jew , born in Tarsus in Cilicia , but brought up here in Jerusalem as a student of Gamaliel . I received instruction in the Law of our ancestors and was just as zealous for God as are all of you .
» I persecuted the people who followed this Way to the point of death . I arrested men and women and threw them into prison .
» The High Priest and the whole Council can prove that I am telling the truth . I received letters from them written to fellow Jews in Damascus , so I went there to arrest these people and bring them back in chains to Jerusalem to be punished .
» While I was traveling I came near Damascus about midday . Suddenly a bright light from the sky flashed around me .
» I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me : ‘ Saul , Saul ! Why do you persecute me ? ’
» Who are you , Lord ? « I asked . » I am Jesus of Nazareth , whom you persecute , « he said to me .
» Everyone with me saw the light . They did not hear the voice of the one speaking to me .
» I asked : What shall I do , Lord ? He said : ‘ Go to Damascus . There you will be told what God wants you to do . ’
» I was blind because of the bright light . So my companions took me by the hand and led me to Damascus .
» A man named Ananias was in that city . He is a religious man who obeyed our Law and was highly respected by all the Jews living there .
» He came and stood by me , and said : ‘ Brother Saul , see again ! ’ ’ At that very moment I saw again and looked at him .
» He said : ‘ The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will . You are to see his righteous servant , and to hear him speak with his own voice .
‘ You will be a witness for him to tell everyone what you have seen and heard .
‘ Wait no longer ! Get up and be baptized and have your sins washed away by praying to him . ’
» I went back to Jerusalem . Then I have a vision while I prayed in the temple .
» I saw the Lord . He said to me : ‘ Hurry and leave Jerusalem because the people here will not accept your witness about me . ’
» I answered , ‘ Lord they know very well that I went to the synagogues and arrested and beat those who believe in you .
‘ » When your witness Stephen was put to death , I was there , approving of his murder and taking care of the coats of his murderers . ’ «
» The Lord said : ‘ Go ! I will send you far away to the people of the nations . ’
The people listened to Paul until he said this . Then they shouted at the top of their voices : » Away with him ! Kill him ! He is not fit to live ! «
They were screaming , throwing off their clothes , and throwing dust up in the air .
The Roman commander ordered his men to take Paul into the barracks . He told them to whip him in order to find out why the Jews were screaming like this against him .
When they tied him up to be whipped Paul said to the officer standing there , » Is it lawful for you to whip a Roman citizen who has not been tried for a crime ? «
When the officer heard this , he went to the commander and asked him : » What are you doing ? That man is a Roman citizen ! «
The commander went to Paul and asked him : » Tell me , are you a Roman citizen ? « » Yes , « answered Paul .
The commander said : » I became one by paying a large amount of money . « » I am one by birth , « Paul answered .
At once the men who were going to question Paul drew back from him . The commander was frightened when he found out that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had put him in chains .
The commander wanted to find out for sure what the Jews were accusing Paul of . The next day he had Paul’s chains taken off and ordered the chief priests and the whole Council to meet . Then he took Paul and made him stand before them .
Paul looked straight at the Council and said : » Fellow Israelites ! My conscience is perfectly clear about the way in which I have lived before God to this very day . «
The high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth .
Paul said to him : » God will strike you , white washed wall ! Do you sit judging me according to the Law , and against law command me to be struck ? «
Those who stood near him said , » Do you revile the high priest of God ? «
Then Paul said , » I did not know , brothers , that he was the high priest . It is written : You shall not speak evil of the ruler of your people . «
When Paul saw that part of them were Sadducees and the other part Pharisees , he cried out in the Sanhedrin : » Men ! Brothers ! I am a Pharisee , the son of a Pharisee ! I am being judged because of the hope and resurrection of the dead . «
When he said this dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees . The crowd was divided .
The Sadducees say that there is no resurrection , neither angel , nor spirit . The Pharisees believe both .
There arose a great cry . The scribes who were on the Pharisees’ side arose and spoke , » We find no evil in this man . But if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him , let us not fight against God . «
The dispute became so violent the commander was afraid they would pull Paul to pieces . He commanded the soldiers to go down and to take him from among them by force , and to bring him into the barracks .
The following night the Lord stood by him and said : » Be of good courage , Paul , for just as you testified about me in Jerusalem , so you also must bear witness at Rome . «
When day arrived some of the Jews came together and united with an oath saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul .
There were more than forty involved in this conspiracy .
They went to the chief priests and elders and said : » We have united with a great oath that we will eat nothing until we have killed Paul .
» Now therefore you , with the Sanhedrin , inform the commander that he bring him down to you tomorrow . You say you would inquire some more regarding him . We are ready to put him to death before he comes near . «
Hearing about the ambush , Paul’s sister’s son entered the barracks and reported to Paul .
Paul called one of the centurions and said : » Take this young man to the commander , for he has something to tell him . «
The officer took him to the commander , and said : » The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you , because he has something to say to you . «
The commander took him by the hand and led him off by himself , and asked : » What do you have to tell me ? «
He said : » The Jewish authorities have agreed to ask you tomorrow to take Paul down to the Council . They want you to pretend the Council wants to get more accurate information about him .
» Do not give in to them . There are more than forty men lying in wait for him . They are united with an oath that they will neither eat nor drink until they have killed him . Now they are ready and looking for a promise from you . «
So the commander sent the young man away commanding , » Tell no one that you have told these things to me . «
He called two centurions , saying , » Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea . Also prepare seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen , at the third hour of the night .
Provide some horses for Paul to ride and get him safely through to Governor Felix .
Then the commander wrote a letter that went like this :
» Claudius Lysias to His Excellency , Governor Felix : Greetings .
» The Jews seized this man and were about to kill him . I learned that he is a Roman citizen , so I went with my soldiers and rescued him .
» I took him to their council to find out of what they accused him .
» I found that he did not do a thing for which he deserved to die or be put in prison . The accusation against him had to do with questions about their own law .
» When I was informed that there was a plot against him , I decided to send him to you . I told his accusers to make their charges against him before you . «
The soldiers carried out their orders . That night they took Paul as far as Antipatris .
The next day the foot soldiers returned to the fort and left the horsemen to go on with him .
They took him to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor . Then they turned Paul over to him .
The governor read the letter and asked Paul what province he was from . When he found out that he was from Cilicia ,
he said , » I will hear you fully when your accusers arrive . « He commanded him to be kept in the praetorian of Herod .
After five days Ananias the high priest came down with the elders . They brought an orator , Tertullus , who made a statement to the governor against Paul .
Tertullus presented his case :
» We have seen peace under your rule . Excellent accomplishments have come to this nation due to your forethought . We acknowledge this with profound gratitude , most excellent Felix .
» That I not hinder you more , I request that you to hear us briefly in fairness .
» We have found this man to be a troublemaker who stirs up sedition resists lawful authority among all the Jews throughout the world . He is a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes .
» He even tried to desecrate the temple . So we captured him according to our law .
» But the Roman commander Lysias came to us with the use of force and snatched him from our hands .
» He commanded his accusers to come to you . Examine him yourself and you will learn the truth about these charges we bring against him . «
The Jews also joined in accusing him , saying that these things were true .
The governor motioned for Paul to speak . He said , » I know that you have been a judge for this nation for many years . For this reason I cheerfully make my defense .
You can easily verify that it was no more than twelve days ago that I went to worship in Jerusalem .
» They did not find me in the Temple , in the synagogues nor in the city disputing with any man . Neither did I cause a riot with the people .
» Neither can they prove the things for which they now accuse me .
» This I confess to you that according to The Way , which they call a sect , I serve the God of our fathers . I believe all the things written in the law and the prophets .
» I have hope toward God , which they also accept , that there will be a resurrection of the dead , both of the righteous and the unrighteous .
» I exercise myself always , to have a conscience void of offense toward God and toward men .
» Now after many years I came to bring offerings and gifts of mercy to my nation .
» Some Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple . There was neither crowd nor disturbance !
» They should have been here before you to testify against me .
» Or let the men here say what wrong they found in me while I stood before the Sanhedrin .
» Except for one utterance I cried out while standing among them . It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am called in question by you this day . «
When Felix heard these things , having more perfect knowledge of that way , he deferred them saying , » When Lysias the commander comes here I will decide your case . «
He commanded a centurion to keep Paul . Allow him some freedom of custody and that some of his people should come and minister to him .
A few days later Felix arrived with Drusilla his wife , who was a Jewess . He sent for Paul and listened to him concerning faith in Christ .
He reasoned about righteousness , temperance , and judgment to come . Felix trembled , and answered : » Go your way for now . When I have time I will send for you . «
He hoped that Paul would give him money to free him . He sent for him frequently and conversed with him .
After two years Porcius Festus succeeded Felix . Felix was willing to show the Jews a favor . He left Paul in prison .
Three days after arriving in the province Festus ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem .
The high priest and Jewish leaders brought charges against Paul .
They desired favor against him that he would transfer him to Jerusalem . Then they would ambush him along the way and kill him .
But Festus answered , that Paul should be kept at Caesarea , and that he would go there shortly .
He said : » Let those who have authority among you go there with me to present your case against this man if there is anything out of the way about the man . «
After he stayed there more than ten days , he went to Caesarea . The next day he sat in judgment . He commanded Paul be brought before him .
When he arrived the Jews who also came there from Jerusalem presented many grievous complaints against Paul . They could not prove them .
Paul defended himself : » Neither against the law of the Jews , neither against the temple , nor yet against Caesar , have I committed any sin . «
Festus was willing to do the Jews a favor , so he answered Paul : » Will you go up to Jerusalem , and there be judged of these things before me ? «
» I stand at Caesar’s court , « Paul replied , » where I ought to be judged . I have done nothing wrong to the Jews , as you are finding out .
» If I am a wrongdoer , or have committed any thing worthy of death , I do not refuse to die . But if charges brought against me by the Jews are not true no man has the right to hand me over to them . I appeal to Caesar . «
Then Festus conferred with his council and answered : » Have you appealed to Caesar ? To Caesar you shall go . «
A few days later king Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to greet Festus .
While they were there Festus declared Paul’s cause to the king . He said , » There is a man that Felix left a prisoner .
» When I was at Jerusalem , the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me about him . They desire to have judgment against him .
» I told them it is not the Roman practice to deliver any man to die before his accusers face him . He should answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him .
» When they came before me , without any delay I sat in judgment , and commanded the man to be brought in .
» When the accusers took the stand they produced no charge of the wicked things I supposed about him .
» They had questions against him about their own superstition . They had one about Jesus , who is dead , but Paul affirmed to be alive .
» Since I doubt such manner of questions , I asked him if he would go to Jerusalem to be judged there of these matters .
» Paul appealed to be reserved to the hearing of Augustus . So I commanded him to be kept until I might send him to Caesar . «
Then Agrippa said to Festus : » I would also hear the man myself . « Festus replied : » Tomorrow , you will hear him . «
The next day Agrippa and Bernice arrived with great elegance . They entered the place of hearing with the commanders and important men of the city . Festus gave the order for Paul to be brought in .
Festus said , » King Agrippa and all men who are present with us , you see this man , about whom all the crowds of the Jews have dealt with me , both at Jerusalem , and also here , crying that he should not live any longer .
» I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death . He has appealed to Augustus and I have determined to send him .
» I have no certain thing to write to my lord . I have brought him forth before you , and especially before you , O king Agrippa , that , after examination I might have something to write .
» It seems unreasonable to send a prisoner and not signify the crimes charged against him . «
Agrippa said to Paul , » You are permitted to speak for yourself . « Then Paul stretched out his arm and began his defense ,
» I would be happy , King Agrippa , to answer for myself before you concerning all the things of which the Jews accuse me .
» I know you are an expert in all customs and controversy among the Jews . Therefore I urge you to hear me patiently .
» All the Jews know the way I first lived as a youth among my own nation at Jerusalem .
» They knew me from the beginning . They could testify that I was from the strictest sect of our religion and I lived as a Pharisee .
» Now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers .
» Our twelve tribes served God day and night with the promise and hope of what was to come . It is because of this hope that the Jews accuse me , King Agrippa .
» Why should it be an incredible thought to you that God should raise the dead ?
» I was convinced that I should oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth .
» That I did in Jerusalem . I locked up many of the holy ones in prison . I received authority from the chief priests and gave the command to put them to death .
» I punished them in every synagogue and tried to force them to recant their beliefs . I was exceedingly mad against them . I persecuted them even in strange cities .
» I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests .
» At midday , O king , I saw on the way a light from heaven . It was brighter than the sun and shinned all around me . It also shinned around those who journeyed with me .
» We all fell to the ground . I heard a voice speaking to me . It said in the Hebrew tongue : ‘ Saul , Saul , why do you persecute me ? It is hard for you to kick against the goads . ’ ’ You only hurt yourself .
» I said : ‘ Who are you , Lord ? ’ ’ And he answered : ‘ I am Jesus whom you persecute .
» Stand up on your feet . I have appeared to you for this purpose , to make you a minister and a witness both of these things that you have seen , and of those things I will show to you .
» I will rescue you from the people and the nations . I am sending you to them .
» To open their eyes , and to turn them from darkness to light , and from the power of Satan to God . They may receive forgiveness of sins , and inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me . ’
» You see , O King Agrippa , I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision .
» I preached first to Damascus , and to Jerusalem , and throughout all the coasts of Judea , and then to the people of the nations , that they should repent and turn to God , and prove their repentance by deeds .
» For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple , and went about to kill me .
« Having obtained help from God , I continue to this day , witnessing both to small and great , saying no other things than those that the prophets and Moses said should come .
» That Christ should suffer , and that he should be the first to rise from the dead , and should show light to the people , and to the nations . «
While he was defending himself , Festus said with a loud voice : » Paul , you are beside yourself . Much learning has made you mad . «
But he answered back : » I am not mad , most noble Festus . I speak the words of truth and soberness !
» For the king knows about these things . I speak freely to him for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him . For this was not done in a corner .
» King Agrippa , do you believe the prophets ? I know that you believe . «
Then Agrippa said to Paul : » In a short time you would persuade convince me to become a Christian . «
Paul replied , » I pray to God , that you and also all that hear me this day were altogether such as I am , except for these bonds . «
When he finished speaking , the king rose up and the governor and Bernice and all who sat with them .
As they left they talked between themselves , saying , » This man does nothing worthy of death or of prison . «
Then Agrippa said to Festus , » This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar . «
When it was determined that we should sail to Italy , they delivered Paul and other prisoners to a man named Julius , a centurion of the band of Augustus .
We entered a ship at Adramyttium and set sail . We intended to sail by the coasts of Asia . Aristarchus , a Macedonian from Thessalonica was with us .
The next day we landed at Sidon . Julius treated Paul in a kind way and gave him liberty to go to his friends to refresh himself .
When we set sail from there we sailed under the shelter of Cyprus , because the winds were contrary .
When we sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia , we came to Myra , a city of Lycia .
There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing to Italy . He put us on it .
We sailed slowly for many days and had problems arriving off Cnidus . The wind did not allow us to hold our course . So we sailed to the downwind part of Crete near Salmone .
It was difficult to move along the coast . We came to a place called Fair Havens near the town of Lasea .
Much time had been lost and sailing was now dangerous . Because the fast was over Paul admonished them ,
» Men , I see that our voyage from here on will be dangerous . There will be great damage to the cargo and to the ship , and loss of life as well . «
But the army officer was convinced by what the captain and the owner of the ship said , and not by what Paul said .
It was not a good harbor in which to spend the winter . Nearly everyone was in favor of putting out to sea and trying to reach Phoenix in order to spend the winter there . Phoenix is a harbor in Crete that faces southwest and northwest .
A gentle wind from the south began to blow . The men thought they could accomplish their plan . So they pulled up the anchor and sailed as close as possible along the coast of Crete .
Soon a very strong northeast wind blew down from the island .
It hit the ship and it was impossible to keep the ship headed into the wind . We gave up trying and let it be carried along by the wind .
We had shelter when we passed to the south of the little island of Cauda . There , with some difficulty we managed to make the ship’s boat secure .
They pulled it aboard and then fastened some ropes tight around the ship . They were afraid that they might run into the sandbanks quicksand off the coast of Libya , so they lowered the sail and allowed the ship be carried by the wind .
The violent storm continued . The next day they began to throw some of the ship’s cargo overboard .
The following day they threw part of the ship’s equipment overboard .
The sun and stars did not appear for many days . No small tempest pressed upon us . All hope of our being saved was taken away .
After they spent a long time without eating Paul stood up and said : » Sirs , you should listen to me . You should not have put out to sea from Crete to sustain this damage and loss .
» I urge you to be of good cheer for none of you will lose your life , only the ship .
» Last night an angel of the God of whom I serve stood beside me .
» He said , » Paul , do not be afraid . You must stand before Caessar and God has graciously given you the lives of you and all who sail with you .
» Be of good cheer . I believe God . It will happen just as he spoke to me .
» But we must run aground on some island . «
On the fourteenth night we were driven to and fro in the sea of Adria . About midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some land .
They sounded and found twenty fathoms . After a little space they sounded again and found fifteen fathoms .
Fearing they would be cast ashore on rocky ground they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight .
The sailors were seeking to flee from the ship . They lowered the boat into the sea by pretending they were lowering some anchors from the bow .
Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers : » Unless these men remain in the ship , you cannot be saved . «
Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat , and let her fall off .
At daybreak Paul encouraged all of them to eat some food , saying , » This day is the fourteenth day that you wait and continue without food .
» I encourage you to take some food for this is for your safety . Not a hair will perish from the head of any of you . «
After he said this he took some bread , gave thanks to God in the presence of all . He broke it and began to eat .
Then they were all cheerful and ate some food .
Together there were two hundred and seventy six persons on board .
When they had eaten enough , they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat into the sea .
When daylight came they saw no land . But they thought they saw a bay with a beach . They debated whether to drive the ship upon it .
They threw the anchors overboard and left them in the sea . At the same time they untied the ropes that held the rudders . Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach .
The ship stuck fast on a sandbar and ran aground . The bow struck fast and would not move . Then the stern began to break up by the violence of the waves .
The soldiers’ planned to kill the prisoners to prevent any from swimming away and escaping .
The centurion desired to save Paul so he kept them from doing what they planned . He commanded that those who could swim should throw themselves overboard , and get to the land first .
The rest were to use planks or something from the ship . So they all escaped safe to the land .
When we made it to shore safely we learned that the island was called Malta .
The natives there were very friendly to us . It started to rain and was cold , so they built a fire and made us all welcome .
Paul gathered an armful of sticks and put them on the fire . A snake came out on account of the heat and fastened itself to his hand .
The natives saw the snake hanging on Paul’s hand and said to one another : » This man must be a murderer , but Fate will not let him live , even though he escaped from the sea . «
But Paul shook the snake off into the fire without being harmed at all .
The people were waiting for him to swell up or suddenly drop dead . They waited a long time and saw nothing unusual happen to him . They changed their minds and said he was a god .
A man named Publius , who was the governor of the island , had property around the area . He welcomed us and treated us kindly . We were his guests for three days .
His father was sick in bed . He suffered from fever and dysentery . Paul went to him , prayed , placed his hands on him , and made him well .
After that happened , other sick people on the island went to Paul and were made well .
They honored us with many gifts . When we were going to set sail , they put whatever we needed on board .
After three months we sailed on an Alexandrian ship that wintered at the island . The ship had the gods Castor and Pollux carved on its front .
We stopped at the city of Syracuse and stayed there three days .
We sailed from Syracuse and arrived at the city of Rhegium . The next day a south wind began to blow , and two days later we arrived at the city of Puteoli .
We came across some of the brothers , who kept us with them for seven days ; and so we arrived at Rome .
When the brothers had news for us they came out from town as far as Appius Forum Market place on the Appian Road and the Three Taverns to have a meeting with us . Paul saw them and praised God . He was encouraged .
When we arrived at Rome they allowed Paul to have a house for himself and the armed man who kept watch over him .
Then after three days he sent for the chief men of the Jews . When they assembled , he said to them : » My brothers , though I had done nothing against the people or the ways of our fathers , I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans .
» They questioned me and were ready to set me free , for they found me not guilty of any crime deserving death .
» When the Jews brought charges against me again I presented my cause to Caesar for I said nothing against my nation .
The reason I sent for you is to talk with you . I am in these chains because of the hope of Israel . «
They said to him : » We have not had letters from Judea about you , and none of the brothers have come to us to give an account or say any evil about you .
» We desire to hear your opinion concerning this sect . We have knowledge that it is attacked in all places . «
So they set a date with Paul . A large number of them came that day to the place where Paul was staying . From morning till night he explained his message about the Kingdom of God to them . He tried to convince them about Jesus by quoting from the Law of Moses and the writings of the prophets .
Some of them were convinced by his words , but others did not believe .
So they left , disagreeing among themselves , after Paul had said this one thing : » How well the Holy Spirit spoke through the prophet Isaiah to your ancestors ! «
He said , » Go and say to this people , ‘ You will listen and listen , but not understand . You will look and look , but not see .
‘ » These people have closed their mind and are hard of hearing . They have shut their eyes so that their eyes never see . Their ears never hear . Their minds never understand . They never turn to me for healing . ’
» You need to know that God has sent his salvation to people who are not Jews . They will listen . «
After he said this the Jews left arguing among themselves .
Paul rented a place to live for two full years and welcomed everyone who came to him .
He spread the message about God’s Kingdom and taught boldly about the Lord Jesus Christ . And no one stopped him !
Paul , a servant of Jesus Christ , called to be an apostle , appointed set apart for the good news of God ,
He promised this long ago through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures .
This is about his Son Jesus Christ our Lord , who came from the seed of David according to the flesh .
He was declared to be the Son of God with power through the Spirit of Holiness , by the resurrection from the dead , Jesus Christ our Lord .
Through whom we have received grace and apostleship , for obedience to the faith among all nations , respecting his name .
You are among those called to Jesus Christ .
To all who are in Rome , beloved of God and called to be holy ones : Grace to you and peace from God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ .
First , I thank my God for all of you through Jesus Christ , for your faith is reported throughout the whole world .
God is my witness , whom I serve with my spirit whole heart and mind in the good news of his Son . Without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers .
I pray that I might by the will of God successfully come to you .
I long to see you , that I may impart to you some spiritual gift so that you may be strengthened ,
that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith .
I want you to know , brothers , that I was often determined to come to you , but was hindered until now , that I might have some fruit among you as well as the rest of the nations .
I am a debtor both to the Greeks , and to the barbarians , both to the wise , and to the unwise .
I am ready to preach the good news to you in Rome also .
I am not ashamed of the good news ; for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who exerts active faith believes , to the Jew first , and also to the Greek .
It reveals the righteousness of God from faith-to-faith for it is written : » The righteous shall live by faith . «
The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men , who suppress the truth in unrighteousness .
That which is known about God is clear to them , for God revealed it to them .
His invisible attributes are clearly seen since the creation of the world . The things made prove His eternal power and divine nature . Mankind has no excuse ,
for when they knew God , they did not glorify him as God . They did not thank him and were vain in their reasoning , for their foolish hearts were darkened .
Claiming to be wise , they became fools .
They changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man , and to birds , and four-footed beasts , and creeping things .
God gave them up to uncleanness because of the lusts of their own hearts , to dishonor their own bodies between themselves .
They changed the truth of God into a lie , and worshiped and served the creation more than the Creator , who is blessed forever . Amen .
For this cause God gave them up to vile affections for even their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature .
Also the men left the natural use of the woman and burned in their lust , one toward another ; men with men working that which is obscene . They receive full recompense due for their error .
They did not like to retain God in their knowledge , so God gave them over to a reprobate depraved mind , to do things that are not fitting .
They are filled with all unrighteousness , fornication , wickedness , covetousness , maliciousness ; full of envy , murder , strife , deceit , evil mindedness ; they are whisperers ,
backbiters , haters of God , despiteful , proud , boasters , inventors of evil things , disobedient to parents ,
without understanding , covenant breakers , without natural affection , unforgiving , and unmerciful .
They know the judgment of God , that those who commit such things are worthy of death ! And yet , they not only do the same , but also approve of those who do them .
You who judge have no excuse . For when you judge another you condemn yourself . After all you do the same things .
We are sure that the judgment of God , according to truth , is against those who commit such things .
What do you reason O man ? When you judge these things , and you also do them , do you think that you will escape the judgment of God ?
Do you despise the riches of his goodness , forbearance , and long-suffering ? Do you not know that the goodness of God leads you to repentance ?
Thanks to your stubborn and unrepentant heart , you store up wrath for yourself , in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God .
He will render to each according to his works .
[ He offers ] everlasting life for those who search for incorruptible glory and honor by enduring in good works .
Those who are contentious , and do not obey the truth , but obey unrighteousness , will receive wrath and indignation .
[ There will be ] tribulation and distress on every person who works evil , for the Jew first and for the Greek .
[ There will be ] glory , honor and peace to every one who does good works , for the Jew first and also for the Greek .
God is not partial ! God does not play favorites !
For all who have sinned without law will perish without law . All who have sinned under law will be judged under law .
The hearers of the law are not righteous before God , but the doers of the law will be righteous .
When those of the nations , who have no law , practice by nature the things of the law they are a law to themselves even though they do not have any law .
They show the work of the law written in their hearts . Their conscience also bears witness , and their thoughts accuse or excuse them .
This is in the day when God will judge the secrets of men , according to my good news , by Jesus Christ .
If you are a Jew in name and are resting on the law and taking glory in God ,
you know his will . You approve the things that are more excellent , being instructed out of the law .
And you have confidence that you are a leader of the blind , a light to those in darkness .
You are an instructor of the foolish , a teacher of babes , having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law .
You then who teach another , do you teach yourself ? You who preach not to steal , do you steal ?
You who say man should not commit adultery do you commit adultery ? You who abhors idols do you rob temples ?
You who boast in the law do you by transgression of the law dishonor God ?
The name of God is blasphemed on your account among the nations , just as it is written .
Circumcision is a benefit if you obey the law . But if you are a transgressor of the law your circumcision becomes uncircumcision .
If therefore someone not circumcised obeys the requirements of the law , shall not his uncircumcision be considered circumcision ?
The uncircumcised person is by nature , fulfilling the law . He will judge you because you transgress the law with your written code and circumcision .
He is not a Jew who is one on the outside . Neither is circumcision that which is on the outside in the flesh .
But he is a Jew who is so on the inside with circumcision of the heart , in spirit , not in letter ; whose praise is not of men , but of God .
What then is the superiority of the Jew ? What is the benefit of circumcision ?
Much in every way . First they were entrusted with the oracles of God .
For what ? If some have not believed , will their unbelief make the faith of God of no effect ?
Certainly not ! But let God be true , and every man false . It is written : So that you should be proved righteous in your words and should overcome when you are judged .
If our unrighteousness defines God’s righteousness more clearly , what shall we say ? God is not unrighteous when he vents his anger is he ? I speak in human terms .
Not at all ! For how will God judge the world ?
But what if my untruth serves God’s glory by making his truth stand out more clearly ? Why should I be condemned as a sinner ?
Why not say , » Let us do evil so that good may come ? « Some people have insulted me by accusing me of saying this very thing ! They should be condemned and they will be .
Are we Jews in any better condition than the people of the nations ? Not at all ! I have already shown that Jews and the people of the nations are all under the power of sin .
The Scriptures say : » There is no one who is righteous ,
» There is no one who has insight . No one seeks God !
» All have turned away from God ; they have all done wrong . No one does what is right , not even one . «
» Their throat is an open grave . They have practiced deceit with their tongues . The poison of snakes is under their lips . «
» Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness . «
» Their feet are swift to shed blood . «
» Destruction and misery are in their ways . «
» They have not known the way of peace . «
There is no respect reverence for God before their eyes .
We know that whatever the law says , it speaks to those under the law . Every mouth may be stopped and the entire world may become liable to God for punishment .
No flesh will be justified before God by works of the law . Knowledge of sin comes from the law .
But now apart from the Law the righteousness of God has been revealed , being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets .
God makes people righteous through their active faith in Jesus Christ . God does this to all who believe in Christ , because there is no difference at all .
For all have sinned , and fall short of the glory of God
being justified freely by his grace as a gift through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus .
God displayed Christ publicly as propitiation atonement by his blood through faith . It demonstrated his righteousness . It was through the forbearance of God that he passed by the sins that had taken place before .
It showed his righteousness at this present season that he might himself be righteous , and the justifier of he who has faith in Jesus .
Where is the boasting ? It is excluded . Is it by law ? Is it by works ? No , it is by a principle of faith .
We reason therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law .
Or is God the God of the Jews only ? Is he not the God of the nations also ? Yes , of the nations also .
If God is one he will justify the circumcised by faith , and the uncircumcised through faith .
Do we nullify the law through faith ? No we do not ! In fact , we establish continue stand by uphold the law .
What shall we say about Abraham , our forefather according to the flesh ?
If Abraham was declared righteous by works , he could boast , but not to God .
For what does the scriptures say ? » Abraham believed Jehovah , and it was counted to him as righteousness . «
The pay is counted to the man who works . It is not as grace but as a debt .
He who does not work but believes in him who justifies absolves the ungodly , his faith is counted for righteousness .
David also pronounces blessing on the man , to whom God counts righteousness apart from works ,
saying : » Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven , and whose sins are covered .
» Blessed is the man to whom , Jehovah will not impute sin . «
Is this blessing then pronounced upon the circumcised only , or upon the uncircumcised also ? For we say : » To Abraham his faith was counted for righteousness . «
How then was it counted ? When he was in circumcision , or in uncircumcision ? Not in circumcision , but in uncircumcision :
He received the sign of circumcision , a seal of the righteousness of the faith that he had while he was not circumcised . That way he could be the father of all those who believe , though they are not circumcised , that righteousness might be counted to them .
The father of circumcision to those who not only are circumcised , but who also walk in the steps of faith of our father Abraham that he had when he was not circumcised .
The promise to Abraham or to his seed that he should be heir of the world was not through the law but through righteousness by faith .
If those who are of the law are heirs , faith is made void , and the promise is made of no effect .
The law produces wrath violent passion indignation . But where there is no law there is no sin .
For this reason it is by faith that it may be according to grace divine influence loving-kindness . The promise may be sure to all descendants ! This is not only to that which is of the law , but to that also which is by the faith of Abraham , who is the father of us all .
It is written : » I have made you a father of many nations . « This was in the presence of God , the one in whom he believed . He gives life to the dead , and calls into being that which does not exist .
In hope against hope Abraham believed that he might become a father of many nations , according to that which had been spoken : » So your descendants will be . «
Not being weak in faith he considered his own body now as good as dead he being about a hundred years old , and the deadness of Sarah’s womb .
Yet , he looked to the promise of God . He did not waver through unbelief , but grew strong through faith . He gave the glory to God !
He was fully assured that what he had promised , he was able to perform .
» It was counted to him as righteousness . «
Now it was not written for his sake alone , that it was counted to him .
It is also for our sake , to whom it shall be counted , who believe in him that raised Jesus our Lord from the dead ,
who was delivered up for our trespasses , and was raised for our justification acquittal .
We are justified acquitted made righteous by faith . And we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ .
We have access to grace God’s favor by faith through him . This is where we stand . We rejoice in the hope of the glory of God .
Not only that , but we also rejoice in our tribulations knowing that tribulation produces endurance .
Tribulation produces an approved condition and an approved condition produces hope .
Hope does not disappoint because the love of God has been shed abroad in our hearts . It comes through Holy Spirit , which is God’s gift to us .
While we were yet weak , in due time Christ died for the ungodly .
For scarcely for a righteous man will one die . Perhaps for the good man some one would even dare to die .
But God demonstrates commends his own love toward us , in that , while we were yet sinners , Christ died for us .
Much more , now justified by his blood , we will be saved from the wrath of God through him .
While we were enemies , we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son . Being reconciled , we will be saved by his life .
We also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom we have now received the reconciliation restoration atonement divine favor .
Therefore , through one-man sin entered into the world , and death through sin . So death passed to all men , for all have sinned .
Until the law sin was in the world . Sin is not imputed put on account when there is no law .
Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses , even for those who had not sinned after the likeness of Adam’s transgression . Adam is in some ways like Christ who came later .
But the two are not the same , because God’s gift spiritual endowment is not like Adam’s sin . It is true that many people died because of the sin of that one man . But God’s grace is much greater , and so is his gift to so many people through the loving-kindness of the one man , Jesus Christ .
And there is a difference between God’s gift spiritual endowment and the sin of one man . After the one sin , came the guilty judgment ; but after so many sins , comes the undeserved gift of righteousness .
It was by the transgression of the one that death ruled as king through that one . Even more so shall those who receive the abundance of grace , and of the gift of righteousness , rule as kings in life by the one , Jesus Christ .
The result of one trespass was condemnation for all men . The result of righteousness was justification acquittal , which brings life for all men .
Through the disobedience of one man many have been made sinners . Yet through the obedience of one man many will be made righteous .
The law came that the trespass might increase . But where sin increased God’s loving kindness increased even more .
And what for ? Just as sin reigned in death , even so might grace reign through righteousness to everlasting life through Jesus Christ our Lord .
What shall we say then ? Shall we continue in sin , that grace may abound ?
God forbid . We died to sin ! How could we any longer live in it ?
Or are you ignorant to the fact that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death ?
We were buried therefore with him through baptism into death . Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father , that we might walk in the newness of life .
If we have become united with him in the likeness of his death , we shall be in the likeness of his resurrection .
We know this that our old self was impaled with him that the body of sin might be destroyed , that we should no longer be in bondage to sin .
He who has died is freed from sin .
If we died with Christ , we believe that we shall also live with him .
We know that Christ being raised from the dead died no more ; death no longer has dominion over him .
For the death that he died , he died with reference to sin once . But the life that he lives , he lives to God .
Consider yourselves to be dead with reference to sin , but alive with reference to God through Christ Jesus .
Let no sin rule in your mortal body , that you should obey the lustful desires .
Also do not present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness . Present yourselves to God , as alive from the dead , and your members as instruments of righteousness for God .
Sin will not have dominion over you . For you are not under law , but under grace .
What then ? Shall we sin , because we are not under law , but under grace ? God forbid !
Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient servants you are his voluntary servants because you obey him ? This could be obedience to sin with death in view or obedience to righteousness with holiness in view ?
But thanks to God , that you were the servants of sin yet you became obedient from the heart to the teachings delivered to you .
After being made free from sin , you became servants of righteousness .
I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh . You once presented your members as servants to uncleanness and to sin . Now you present your members as servants to righteousness and sanctification purification holiness .
When you were servants of sin , you were free in regard to righteousness .
You are now ashamed of the fruit you had at that time . For the results of these things is death .
Now you are free from sin and are servants to God . You have your fruit in holiness , and the end everlasting eternal life .
For the wages of sin is death , but the gift from God is everlasting life through Jesus Christ our Lord .
Do you not know , for I speak to men who know the law , that the law has dominion jurisdiction over a man as long as he lives ?
Law binds the married woman to her husband while he lives . But if the husband dies , she is discharged from the law of the husband .
So then if , while the husband lives , she is joined to another man , she will be called an adulteress . If the husband dies , she is free from the law , so that she is no adulteress , though she is joined to another man .
Brothers , you also died to the law through the body of Christ ; that you should be joined to another , even to him who was raised from the dead , that we might bring forth fruit to God .
When we were in the flesh , the sinful passions , which were through the law , worked in our members to bring forth fruit to death .
We have been discharged released from the law . We have died to that by which we were held . So we serve in newness of the Spirit , and not in oldness of the letter .
What shall we say then ? Is the law sin ? God forbid ! I had not known sin except through the law . For I had not known coveting except the law had said : You should not covet .
But sin , finding occasion , worked out in me through the commandment all manner of coveting . Apart from the law sin is dead .
I was alive apart from the law once : but when the commandment came , sin revived , and I died .
The commandment , which was to life , this I found to be to death .
For sin , finding occasion , through the commandment deceived me , and through it killed me .
The law is holy , and the commandment holy , and righteous , and good .
Did that which is good become death to me ? God forbid ! It was sin , producing death in me through what is good . This way sin might be shown to be sin . Through the commandment sin could be recognized .
For we know that the law is spiritual . But I am fleshly and sold under sin .
I do not understand what I am doing . For what I want to do I do not do . What I hate , I do .
But if what I do not want to do , I do , I consent to the law that it is right .
Now then it is no longer I that do it , but the sin that dwells in me .
I know that good does not live in my human nature . For even though the desire to do good is in me , I am not able to do it .
I do not do the good I want to do . Instead , I do the evil that I do not want to do .
If I do what I do not want to do , this means that I am no longer the one who does it . Instead , it is the sin that lives in me .
I find that this law is at work . When I want to do what is good , what is evil is the only choice I have .
My inner person delights in the law of God .
However I see a different law at work in my body . This law fights against the law that my mind approves of . It makes me a prisoner to the law of sin that is at work in my body .
Miserable man that I am ! Who will rescue me from the body undergoing this death ?
Thanks to God , through our Lord Jesus Christ ! So then I can serve God’s law only with my mind , while my human nature serves the law of sin .
Those who live through in union with because of Jesus Christ have no condemnation . They do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit .
The law of the Spirit gives us life through with because of Christ Jesus . It has set me free from the law of sin and death .
God did what the Law could not do , because human nature was weak . He sent his own son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin offering and do away with sin . So he condemned sin in sinful human nature .
God did this so that the righteous requirements of the Law might be fully satisfied in us who live according to the Spirit , and not according to human nature .
They who live according to flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh . They who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit .
The mind of sinful flesh fleshly thought means death ; but the mind influenced by the Spirit gives life and peace .
This is because the mind of the flesh is hostile toward God . It is not subject to the law of God for it cannot be .
Those influenced by the sinful flesh cannot please God .
But you are not in flesh but in Spirit , if indeed God’s Spirit dwells in you . If any one does not have the Spirit of Christ he does not belong to him .
If Christ is with you , the body is dead on account of sin , but the Spirit is life on account of righteousness .
If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from among the dead dwells with you , he who raised Christ from among the dead shall also make your mortal bodies alive . This is on account of his Spirit that dwells with you .
So then , brothers we are under obligation , not to the flesh , to live according to flesh human nature ,
for if you live according to flesh , you are about to die . If by the Spirit , you put to death the deeds of the body , you will live .
All who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God .
For you have not received a spirit of bondage again causing fear , but you have received a spirit of adoption , whereby we cry , Father , Father ! Chaldee : Abba , meaning father .
The Spirit itself Greek : autos ho pneuma itself the Spirit bears witness with our spirit mind and heart , that we are children of God .
If children , then heirs of God , and joint heirs with Christ . If indeed we suffer with him we may also be glorified with him .
I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that will be revealed in us .
For the earnest expectation of the creation is waiting for the manifestation revelation disclosure of the sons of God .
For the creation was subject to corruption , not by it’s own will but by reason of the one who subjected it on the basis of hope .
The creation will also be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God .
For we know that the whole creation groans and is in pain together until now .
We also , who have the first fruits of the Spirit , even we groan within ourselves , waiting for the adoption and the release from our bodies by ransom .
We are saved by this hope . But hope that is seen is not hope . For does a man hope for what he sees ?
If we hope for what we do not see , do we have patience to wait for it ?
Likewise the Spirit also helps our weaknesses . We do not know what we should pray for , as we should . The Spirit of God makes intercession with groaning that cannot be spoken .
So he who searches the hearts knows what is the inclination purpose mind-set of the Spirit of God , because the Spirit makes intercession for the holy ones according to the will of God .
We know that all things work together for good to those who love God , to those who are called according to his purpose .
Those he first recognized , he ordained in advance that they be conformed to the image of his Son , that he might be the firstborn among many brothers .
He ordained in advance the ones he called . He declared righteous the ones he called . He also glorified those he declared righteous .
What shall we then say about these things ? If God is for us , who can be against us ?
He that did not spare his own Son , but delivered him up for us all , will he not with him freely give us all things ?
Who will bring any charge against the ones God has chosen ? It is God who justifies makes righteous .
Who is he that condemns ? It is Christ that died , yes rather , that is risen again , who is even at the right hand of God , who also makes intercession for us .
Who will separate us from the love of Christ ? Will tribulation , or distress , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or peril , or sword ?
It is written : » For your sake we are put to death all day long . We are considered as sheep for the slaughter . «
In all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us .
For I am persuaded , that neither death , nor life , nor angels , nor principalities , nor powers , nor things present , nor things to come ,
Nor height , nor depth , nor any other creature , shall be able to separate us from the love of God , which is in Christ Jesus our Lord .
I tell the truth in Christ . I do not lie ! My conscience bears witness with me in Holy Spirit .
I have great sorrow and continual grief in my heart .
I could wish that I were accursed separated banned excommunicated from Christ for the good of in behalf of my countrymen and brothers the Jews .
They are Israelites and the adoption belongs to them . They have the glory of the covenants . The law was given to them along with the service and promises .
The forefathers belong to them from whom came the Christ according to the flesh . God who is over all is blessed forever . Amen .
It is not as if the word of God failed . Not all who come from Israel are really Israel .
It is not because they are Abraham’s that they are all children , but : » What will be called ‘ your seed ’ ’ will be through Isaac . «
That is , the children of the flesh are not the children of God ; but the children of the promise are counted as seed .
The word of promise : » According to this time I will come and Sarah will have a son . «
Not only that , but Rebecca conceived by Isaac our father .
When they had not yet been born nor performed anything good or vile , so the purpose of God regarding the choosing would continue without dependence on works but on the One who calls .
She was told : » The older will serve the younger . «
It is written : » I loved Jacob , and I hated Esau . «
What shall we say then ? Is there injustice with God ? There is not !
He says to Moses , » I will show mercy to the one I choose to show mercy , and I will feel compassion for the one I choose to feel compassion . «
So then it does not depend on mans will or effort , but on God who shows mercy .
The scripture says to Pharaoh : » For this reason I have raised you up , that I might through you , show my power and declare my name in all the earth . «
He shows mercy to the one he chooses , and he allows others to be stubborn .
You say to me : » Why does he yet find fault ? Who resists his purpose will ? «
Yes , but you , O man , who are you to answer back to God ? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it : » Why have you made me this way ? «
Or does the potter not have authority over the clay ? Can he make out of the same lump one vessel to honor , and another for common use ?
If God decided to show his wrath and make his power known , endured with much long-suffering vessels of wrath fit for destruction .
In that way he could make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy that he had prepared in advance for glory .
We are the ones he has also called , not only from among the Jews , but also from among the nations .
He says also in Hosea : » Those who are not my people I will call my people . And she who is not loved I will call loved . «
In the place where it was said to them : » You are not my people , they will be called Sons of the living God . «
Isaiah cries out concerning Israel : » Should the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea , the remnant shall be saved .
» He is bringing the matter to an end , and cutting it short in righteousness . Jehovah will make an accounting on the earth . «
Just as Isaiah said earlier : » Unless Jehovah of Hosts had left a seed to us , we should have become like Sodom , and Gomorrah . «
What shall we say ? The nations did not pursue righteousness . Yet they have attained to righteousness , the righteousness that is based on the principle of faith .
But Israel , pursuing after a law of righteousness , has not attained to that law .
Why ? It is because it was not based on the principle of faith , but on that of works . They have stumbled at the stumbling stone .
It is written : » Behold , I place in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence and he that believes on him will not be ashamed . «
Brothers , my hearts desire and my prayer to God for Israel is for their salvation .
I testify that they have zeal for God , but not according to precise and correct knowledge .
They are ignorant of God’s righteousness . They seek to establish their own righteousness and have not submitted to the righteousness of God .
Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who exerts active faith .
Moses writes down the righteousness that is of the law . The man who has practiced those things shall live by them .
But the righteousness of faith speaks this way : » Do not say in your heart : ‘ who will ascend to heaven ? That is , to bring Christ down ;
or » ‘ who will descend into the abyss ? That is , to bring up Christ from among the dead . ’ «
But what does it say ? » The word is near you , in your mouth and in your heart . « It is the » word « of faith , which we preach .
If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord , and have active faith in your heart that God raised him from the dead , you will be saved .
For with the heart one believes for righteousness . And with the mouth one declares for salvation .
The scripture says : » No one believing on him shall be disappointed . «
For there is no difference between Jew and Greek . The same Lord God of all is abounding in riches for all who call on him .
» Everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved . «
How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed ? And how will they believe in him of whom they have not heard ? And how will they hear without someone to preach ?
How will they preach unless they have been sent ? Just as it is written : » How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news , who proclaim peace and who bring good tidings of good things ! For they proclaim salvation and say to Zion : » Your God reigns as king ! « Hebrew : Elohiym ’ ’ malak ’ : God rules !
But they have not all obeyed the good news . For Isaiah says : » Jehovah , who has believed our message ? «
So then faith comes by hearing , and hearing by the word about Christ .
I say : Have they not heard ? Yes in fact their sound went » into all the earth , and their words to the ends of the inhabited earth . «
I say Israel did not know . First Moses said : » I will provoke you people to rivalry through that which is not a nation , and I will anger you with a foolish nation . «
Isaiah is very bold , and says : » Those who did not seek me found me . I was made manifest to those who did not ask for me . «
But to Israel he says : » All day long I have stretched out my hands to a people who are disobedient and self-willed obstinate . «
I ask has God rejected his people ? Certainly not ! I also am an Israelite , a descendant of the seed of Abraham , of the tribe of Benjamin .
God has not rejected his people whom he first knew . Do you remember what the Scripture says about Elijah ? How he made intercession to God against Israel ?
» Jehovah , they have killed your prophets , and torn down your altars . I am left alone , and they seek my life . «
What does God say in answer to him ? » I have reserved to myself seven thousand men , who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal . «
Even so at this present time there is a remnant chosen according to God’s grace .
If it is by grace then it is no longer on the basis of works . Otherwise grace is not grace undeserved kindness . But if it is of works then it is not by grace . Otherwise works are no longer works .
What then ? Israel has not obtained that which he seeks . The chosen ones have obtained it , and the rest were blinded rendered stupid hardened made insensitive .
It is written , » God has given them the spirit of slumber , eyes that they should not see , and ears that they should not hear to this very day . «
David says , » Let their table be made a snare , and a trap , and a stumbling block , and recompense to them .
» Let their eyes be darkened , that they may not see , and bow down their back always . «
I ask : Did they stumble and fall ? Certainly not ! But rather through their fall into sin salvation has come to the nations . This will provoke them to jealousy .
Now if their fall into sin means riches to the world , and their decrease means riches of the nations how much more will their full number mean ?
I speak to you people of the nations . For I am the apostle to the nations and I glorify honor praise celebrate my ministry .
If by any means I may provoke those who are of my flesh fellow countrymen , and might save some of them .
If their rejection means reconciliation for the world , what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead ?
If the first piece is holy , the lump is also holy . If the root is holy , so are the branches .
Some of the branches are broken off . You , being a wild olive tree , were grafted in among them . Therefore you partake of the root and fatness of the olive tree with them .
Do not boast against the branches . But if you boast , you do not support the root , but the root supports you .
You will say , » The branches were broken off , that I might be grafted in . «
They were broken off because of unbelief ! You stand by faith ! Do not be conceited but be reverent .
God did not spare the natural branches and he will not spare you !
Observe both God’s kindness and severity . Severity is for those who fail to continue . But kindness is for you as long as you continue in his kindness . Otherwise you will be cut off .
If they do not continue in unbelief they will be grafted in . For God is able to graft them in again .
If you were cut out of the olive tree that is wild by nature , and were grafted contrary to nature into a garden olive tree : how much more could these , which are the natural branches , be grafted into their own olive tree ?
I do not want you to be ignorant of this secret , lest you should be wise in your own conceits estimation . Blindness has happened to Israel , until the fullness of the nations comes in .
In this way all Israel will be saved . As it is written : The deliverer will come out of Zion and will remove ungodliness from Jacob .
For this is my covenant with them , when I shall take away their sins .
Concerning the good news , they are enemies for your sakes . With reference to the chosen ones , they are beloved for the fathers’ sake .
The gifts and calling of God are irrevocable .
In times past you have not believed did not obey God . Yet you have now obtained mercy through their unbelief :
Even so these also do not believe now . Through the mercy shown they also may obtain mercy .
For God has stopped all disobedience so he might show mercy to all .
O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God ! How unsearchable are his judgments . His ways are beyond human understanding !
For who has known the mind of Jehovah ? Or who has been his counselor ?
Or who has first given to him , that it shall be repaid to him again ?
For from him , and through him , and to him are all things : Glory to him forever ! Amen .
I request urge implore you brothers , by the mercies of God , that you present your bodies a living sacrifice , holy , acceptable to God , which is your reasonable service .
Do not be conformed to this world religious , social , political , and economic arrangement . But be transformed by the renewing of your mind . Prove what is the good , acceptable , and perfect will of God .
I say through the grace given to me that every man among you should not think more highly of himself than he ought to think . But to think soberly , just as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith .
For we have many members in one body and all members do not have the same function .
These many members are one body in Christ , and every one , individually , is a member one of the other .
We have gifts that differ according to the grace that is given to us . Whether prophecy , let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith ;
or ministry , let us wait on our ministering ; or he who teaches on teaching ;
or he who exhorts ; on exhortation ; he who gives let him do it with liberality ; he who rules , with diligence ; he who shows mercy , with cheerfulness .
Let love be without hypocrisy . Abhor evil and cling to good .
Be devoted to one another with brotherly love , in honor preferring one another .
Do not lag behind in diligence . Be fervent in spirit serving God .
Rejoice in hope ! Be patient in tribulation . Continue in prayer .
Contribute to the needs of the holy ones and practice hospitality .
Bless those who persecute you . Bless and do not curse .
Rejoice with those who rejoice , and weep with those who weep .
Be of the same mind as others . Do not think lofty things but be led along by lowly things . Do not be wise in your own conceit self-love vanity estimation .
Return evil for evil to no man . Provide honest things in the sight of all men .
When it is possible , be peaceable with all men .
Dearly beloved , do not avenge yourselves , instead leave room for divine punishment , for it is written : Vengeance is mine ; I will repay , says Jehovah .
Therefore if your enemy is hungry , feed him . If he thirsts , give him drink . For in so doing you will heap coals of fire on his head .
Do not be evil , but overcome evil with good .
Let every person be subject to superior authorities . For there is no authority except by God . God allows the authorities to serve in their positions .
Whoever opposes the authority resists the ordinance of God . Those who resist will receive judgment .
For rulers are objects of fear , not to good works , but to the evil . Will you not have respect for the authority ? Do what is good , and you will have praise from it .
He is the minister of God to you for good . But if you do that which is evil , be afraid for he does not bear the sword in vain . He is the minister of God , an avenger to execute wrath upon him that does evil .
You must be in subjection , not only because of that wrath , but also for the sake of your conscience .
That is why you pay taxes . They are God’s ministers continually serving this very purpose .
Render therefore to all their due . Provide tribute to whom tribute is due . Give custom to whom custom is owed . Render fear to whom fear is owed and offer honor to whom honor is deserved .
Owe no man any thing but to love one another . He that loves another has fulfilled obeyed the law .
For the Law code says : You must not commit adultery , you must not murder , you must not steal , you must not bear false witness , and you must not covet . If there is any other commandment , it is briefly comprehended in this saying ; namely , you must love your neighbor as yourself .
Love works no ill to his neighbor . Therefore love is the law’s fulfillment .
You know the time . It is the hour for you to awake from sleep . Now our salvation is nearer than when we became believers .
The night is far along and the day is at hand . Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness , and let us put on the armor of light .
Let us walk honestly as in the daytime , not in rioting and drunkenness , not in sexual immorality and loose conduct , not in strife and jealousy .
Put on live like clothe yourself with the Lord Jesus Christ , and do not make provision for the desires of the flesh .
Accept the man who has a weak faith , but not to entertain doubtful thinking .
For one believes that he may eat all things . Another who is weak eats only vegetables .
Let the one eating not look down on the one not eating . Let the one who does not eat judge him that eats , for God has received him .
Who are you to judge another man’s servant ? He stands or falls before his own master . Yes , he will be made to stand for God can make him stand .
One person judges one day above another . Another person judges every day alike . Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind .
He who regards the day regards it to God and he who does not regard the day does not regard it to God . He , who eats , eats to God , for he gives God thanks . He who does not eat does not eat to God and he gives God thanks .
For none of us lives to himself , and no man dies to himself .
For if we live , we live to God and if we die , we die to God . Therefore should we live or die , we are God’s .
To this end Christ both died , and rose , and lived again , that he might be Lord both of the dead and the living .
Why do you judge your brother ? Why do you look down on your brother with contempt ? We will all stand before the judgment seat of God Theos .
It is written : As I live , says Jehovah , every knee will bow to me , and every tongue will acknowledge confess to Jehovah .
So then every one of us will give account of himself to God .
Let us not judge one another any more . Let no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother’s way .
I know , and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus , that there is nothing unclean in itself . If someone thinks something is unclean it is unclean to him .
If because of your food your brother is grieved , you do not walk in love . Do not allow what you eat to destroy the one for whom Christ died .
Do not let the good you do be spoken of as evil .
For the kingdom of God is not food and drink ; but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit .
For he that serves Christ is acceptable to God , and approved of by men .
Let us follow after the things that make for peace , and things that are encouraging to one another .
Do not tear down the work of God for the sake of food . All things indeed are pure ; but it is evil for that man who eats with offense .
It is good neither to eat food , nor to drink wine , nor any thing that causes your brother to stumble or be offended and weakened .
Do you have faith ? Have it for yourself before God . Happy is he who does not condemn himself in that thing that he allows .
He that doubts is damned if he eats , because he eats not by faith . Whatever is not by faith is sin !
We who are strong in the faith ought to help the weak to carry their burdens . We should not just please ourselves .
Let every one of us please his neighbor for his good to build him up .
For even Christ did not please himself . However it is written , » The reproaches insults hurled at you have fallen on me . «
The things written in earlier times were written for our instruction , that we through endurance and the encouragement from the Scriptures might have hope .
Now may the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus .
To this end you may glorify God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ with one mind and one accord language united expression .
Receive one another , as Christ also received us to the glory of God .
Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcised for the truth of God , to confirm the promises made to the fathers .
That the nations might glorify God for his mercy as it is written : » For this cause I will confess you to the people of the nations , and sing to your name . «
And again he says : » Rejoice , you nations , with his people . «
And again : » Praise Jehovah , all you nations ; and laud him , all you people . «
And again , Isaiah says : » Then in that day the nations will search for and turn to the root of Jesse . He will stand as a signal for the peoples . His resting place will be glorious . «
Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , that you may abound in hope , through the power of the Holy Spirit .
I am also persuaded about you , my brothers , that you also are full of goodness , filled with all knowledge , able also to admonish one another .
Nevertheless , brothers , I have written more boldly to you on some points , keeping you in mind , because of the grace that is given to me from God ,
That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the nations , ministering the good news of God , that the offering of these nations might be acceptable , being sanctified by the Holy Spirit .
I glory in Jesus Christ in my service to God .
I will not dare to speak of any of those things that Christ has not accomplished through me . I will lead the nations to obey God in word and deed .
Through mighty signs and wonders , by the power of the Spirit of God . From Jerusalem , and round about Illyricum , I have fully preached the good news of Christ .
I have strived to preach the good news , not where Christ was named , lest I should build upon another man’s foundation :
It is written , » To whom he was not announced , they shall see : and those who have not heard shall understand . «
For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you .
I have no more places to go in these parts , and have a great desire these many years to come to you .
When I take my journey to Spain , I will come to you . I trust to see you in my journey , and to be escorted on my way by you , after I have been satisfied with your company .
Now I go to Jerusalem to minister to the holy ones .
It pleased those of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor holy ones in Jerusalem .
It pleased them to do so and they are debtors for this . If the nations have been made partakers of their spiritual things , their duty is also to minister to them in physical things .
After I have performed this and have sealed to them this fruit , I will come to you in Spain .
I am sure that , when I come to you , I will come in the fullness of the blessing of the good news of Christ .
Now I beg you , brothers , for the Lord Jesus Christ’s sake , and for the love of the Spirit , that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me .
That I may be delivered from those who do not believe in Judea ; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted by the holy ones .
That I may come to you with joy by the will of God , and may with you be refreshed .
The God of peace be with you all . Amen .
I commend to you Phoebe our sister , who is a minister of the congregation at Cenchrea .
Receive her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the holy ones . Assist her in whatever business she has need of from you . She has been a great help to many people including me .
Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus .
They have risked their own necks for my life . I not only thank them but also the congregations of the nations give thanks .
Likewise greet the congregation that is in their house . Salute my well-beloved Epaenetus , who is of the first fruits converts of Asia to Christ .
Greet Mary for she labored much to help us .
Greet Andronicus and Junia . They are my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners who are well known among the apostles . They were in Christ before me .
Greet Ampliatus my beloved in the Lord .
Greet Urbane for he is our helper in Christ , and Stachys my beloved .
Salute Apelles approved in Christ . Salute them that are of Aristobulus’ household .
Greet my relative Herodion . Greet those who are of the household of Narcissus , for they are in the Lord .
Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa , who labor in the Lord . Salute the beloved Persis , who labored much in the Lord .
Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord , and his mother and mine .
Greet Asyncritus , Phlegon , Hermas , Patrobas , Hermes , and the brothers that are with them .
Greet Philologus , and Julia , Nereus , and his sister , and Olympas , and all the holy ones with them .
Greet one another with a holy kiss . The congregations of Christ greet you .
Now I beseech you , brothers , mark those who cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine you have learned and avoid them .
They do not serve our Lord Jesus Christ , but their own belly ; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the unaware .
Your obedience has come to our attention abroad . I am glad therefore on your behalf . Yet I would have you wise to that which is good and simple concerning evil .
The God of peace will crush Satan under your feet shortly . The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you . Amen .
Timothy my coworker and Lucius , and Jason , and Sosipater , my relative , salute you .
I Tertius , who wrote this letter , salute you in the Lord .
Gaius my host and the whole congregation , salutes you . Erastus the chamberlain of the city salutes you , and Quartus a brother .
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Amen .
Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my good news , and the preaching of Jesus Christ , according to the revelation of the secret , which was kept secret since the world began .
It is now made known by the Scriptures of the prophets according to the commandment of the everlasting God . It is made known to all nations for the obedience of faith .
To God , wise alone , be glory through Jesus Christ forever . Amen .
This letter is from Paul , called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God , and Sosthenes our brother .
To the congregation of God at Corinth . To you , who are sanctified in Christ Jesus . You who are called to be holy ones , with all whom in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord . He is both their Lord and ours .
Grace be to you , and peace , from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
I thank my God always on your behalf , for the grace of God that is given you by Jesus Christ .
He enriches you in every way , in all speaking , and in all knowledge .
The testimony of Christ was confirmed verified established in you .
You do not lack spiritual gifts as you wait for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ .
He will also confirm establish you to the end , that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
God is faithful , by whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord .
I appeal to you , brothers , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that you all speak the same thing and that there are no divisions among you . You should be perfectly joined together united in the same mind and thought .
The house of Chloe told me , my brothers , that there are disputes among you .
Concerning that I say , that each one of you said , » I follow Paul ; « and » I follow Apollos ; « and » I follow Cephas ; « and » I follow Christ . «
Is Christ divided ? Was Paul impaled for you ? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul ?
I thank God that I baptized none of you , but Crispus and Gaius .
So no one should say that I baptized in my own name .
I also baptized the household of Stephanas . Besides that I do not know whether I baptized any others .
Christ did not send me to baptize , but to preach the good news : not with wisdom of words , lest the stake of Christ be emptied of its effect .
For the preaching of the stake is foolishness to those who perish . It is the power of God to us who are saved .
It is written : » I will destroy the wisdom of the wise , and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent . «
Where is the wise ? Where is the scribe ? Where is the philosopher of this age ? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world ?
This is the wisdom of God that the world through its wisdom did not come to know God . God was well pleased through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe .
Indeed Jews ask for signs and Greeks search for wisdom .
We preach Christ impaled . It is a stumbling block to the Jews and foolishness to the nations !
To those who are called , both Jews and Greeks , it is Christ the power of God , and the wisdom of God .
For the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men .
Consider your calling , brothers . Not many wise men after the flesh , not many mighty , not many noble , are called .
Instead God chose the foolish things of the world to confuse shame the wise . God chose the weak things of the world to confuse shame the things that are mighty .
God also chose the base things of the world , and things which are despised , yes , and things which are not , to bring to nothing things that are .
No human being should boast before God .
It is because of him you are united with Christ Jesus , who became wisdom to us from God , and righteousness , and sanctification , and redemption .
Let it be as it is written , » He that boasts , let him boast in Jehovah ! «
Brothers , I did not come to you with superiority of speech or with human wisdom , declaring to you the testimony of God .
I decided not to know anything among you , except Jesus Christ and his death on the torture stake .
And I came to you in weakness , and in fear , and in much trembling .
My speech and my preaching were not with enticing words of man's wisdom , but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power ,
that your faith should not exist in the wisdom of men , but in the power of God .
How is it we speak wisdom among those who are mature , yet not the wisdom of this age , or of the rulers of this age , who come to nothing are doomed to destruction ?
We speak the wisdom of God in a secret , even the hidden wisdom , which God ordained before the ages generations and human entities for our glory .
None of the rulers of this age knew understood for had they known it they would not have impaled the glorious Lord esteemed Master .
It is written : » Eye has not seen , nor ear heard , and it has not entered into the heart of man , the things God prepared for those who love him . «
But God revealed them to us by his Spirit . For the Spirit investigates searches all things , yes even the deep things of God .
For what man knows the things of a man , except the mental disposition that is in man ? Even so no one knows the things of God , but the Spirit of God .
Now we have received , not the spirit of the world , but the Spirit that is from God . This is so we might know the things that are freely given to us from God .
We speak these things , not in the words that man's wisdom teaches . But we speak them with the words the Holy Spirit teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual things .
But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God . They are foolishness to him ! He cannot know them , because they are spiritually discerned .
He that is spiritual judges all things , yet no man judges him .
» Who has understood the mind of Jehovah , or has instructed him , as his counselor ? « But we do have the mind purpose feelings thoughts understanding of Christ .
Brothers , I was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men , but as fleshly men , as babes infants in Christ .
I fed you milk and not solid food . You were not able to receive it . You are not able now !
You are still fleshly ! There is envy , strife , and divisions among you . Do you not walk as ordinary men ?
While one said , » I belong to Paul ; « and another , » I belong to Apollos ; « are you not fleshly human beings ?
Who then is Paul , and who is Apollos , but ministers by whom you believed , even as the Lord gave to every man ?
I have planted , Apollos watered ; but God caused the growth .
Neither he that plants and neither he that waters is anything ; but God gives the increase .
Now he who plants and he who waters are one in purpose and every man will receive his own reward according to his own labor .
For we are fellow workers together with God . You are God's field under cultivation . You are God's building .
According to the grace of God that is given to me , as a wise master builder , I have laid the foundation , and another builds on it . But let every man take heed how he builds .
No other foundation can be laid than that which is laid , which is Jesus Christ .
Now if any man builds upon this foundation gold , silver , precious stones , wood , hay , and stubble ;
every man's work will be made known , for the day will declare it , because it will be revealed by fire ; and the fire will prove what sort every man's work is .
If a man's work that he built upon lasts , he will receive a reward .
If a man's work will be burned , he will suffer loss : but he will be saved by fire .
Do you not know that you are the temple of God , and that the Spirit of God dwells in you ?
God will destroy any man who defiles the temple of God ! For the temple of God is holy . You are that temple !
Let no man deceive himself . If any man among you seems to be wise in this age , let him become a fool , that he may be wise .
For the wisdom of this age is foolishness with God . It is written : » He catches the wise in their own craftiness deception . «
And again : » Jehovah knows the thoughts of the wise , that they are vain useless empty . «
Therefore let no man boast in men . For all things are yours .
Whether Paul , or Apollos , or Cephas , or the world , or life , or death , or things present , or things to come ; all are yours !
And you belong to Christ and Christ belongs to God .
People should regard us as servants of Christ . God has trusted us with his secrets .
It is required of stewards that a man is trustworthy .
But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court . I do not even judge myself .
I know nothing against myself . Yet this does not acquit me , but he that judges me is God .
Do not judge anything before the time . Wait until the Lord comes . He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make apparent the counsels of the hearts . Then each man’s praise will come from God .
Brothers I have applied these things to myself and to Apollos for your sakes . That way you might learn the value of the saying : Do not go beyond the things written . None of you should be arrogant self-important against one another .
For who made you superior to different than another ? What do you have that you did not receive ? If you did receive it , why do you brag , as if you did not receive it ?
You are full and now you are rich , you have reigned as kings without us . I would to God you did reign , that we also might reign with you .
For I think that God has placed us apostles last as men appointed to death . We are made a spectacle to the world , and to angels , and to men .
We are fools for Christ . But you are wise in Christ . We are weak , but you are strong . You are honorable , but we are despised .
Even to this present hour we both hunger and thirst . We are naked . We are treated badly and we are homeless .
We labor , working with our own hands . Being reviled , we bless ; being persecuted , we suffer it ;
being slandered , we answer kindly . We are made as the filth of the world and are the refuse of all things to this day .
I do not write these things to shame you , but as my beloved children I warn you .
Though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ , yet you do not have many fathers . For in Christ Jesus I have given birth to you through the good news .
For this reason I urge you to imitate me .
I send Timothy , my beloved son faithful in the Lord , to you for this purpose . He will remind you of my way of life in Christ , just as I teach it in every congregation .
Now some have become proud arrogant , thinking that I would not come to you .
But I will come to you shortly , if God wills , and I will get to know what the proud ones do and not what they say , but their power .
For the kingdom of God is not in word , but in power .
What do you want ? Shall I come to you with punishment or with love , and in the mild spirit of meekness ?
It is reported that there is sexual immorality among you . This type of fornication is not even found among the people of the nations who do not know God . There is a man who has his father’s wife .
And you are proud ! You should have been filled with sadness that he did this deed . And you should have ejected expelled excommunicated disfellowshiped him from your congregation .
I am not there with you in person . But I am with you in spirit . I have already judged the man who did this .
When you assemble in the name and with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ , I will be with you in spirit .
Deliver this one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh , that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus .
Your boasting is not good . Do you know that a little leaven ferments the whole batch of dough ?
Purge out the old leaven , that you may be a new batch of dough . For even Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us .
Therefore let us celebrate the feast , not with old leaven , neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness ; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
I wrote in a letter to you not to keep company with fornicators .
Yet you cannot completely avoid the fornicators of this world , nor the greedy persons , nor cheaters and robbers , nor those who worship idols . To do so you would have to leave this world .
I wrote you not to keep company with any man who is called a brother who is a fornicator , or who is greedy , or who worships idols , or constantly gets drunk , or cheats people . Do not even eat with such a person .
What have I to do with judging those outside in the world ? Do we not judge those who are inside the congregation ?
God judges those outside . Remove the wicked man from among yourselves .
If you have a dispute with another Christian do you dare to go to a law court before judges who are ungodly ? Why not let the holy ones decide who is right ?
Do you not know that the holy ones will judge the world ? And if you will judge the world , are you unworthy to judge these small matters ?
Do you not know that we will judge angels ? How much more the matters that pertain to this life ?
If you have judgments of things pertaining to this life , would you appoint as judges those who mean nothing to the congregation ?
I speak to shame you . Is it so , that there is not a wise man among you ? Not one who would be able to judge between his brothers ?
But brother goes to court against brother , and this before unbelievers .
It is already a defeat for you that you have lawsuits with one another . Why not let yourself be wronged ? Why not let your selves be defrauded cheated ?
Instead you do wrong and defraud , and you do this to your brothers and sisters !
Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God ? Do not be deceived : neither fornicators , nor people who worship idols , nor adulterers , nor male prostitutes , nor homosexuals ,
nor thieves , nor covetous greedy , nor drunkards , nor revilers , nor extortionists , will inherit the kingdom of God .
That is what some of you were . You have been washed clean and now you are sanctified . The Spirit of our God declares you righteous in the name of the Lord Jesus .
All things are lawful to me , but all things are not expedient profitable good . All things are lawful for me , but I will not be brought under the authority power control of anything .
Foods are for the belly , and the belly for foods , but God will destroy both of them . Now the body is not for fornication but for the Lord , and the Lord is for the body .
God has resurrected the Lord , and will also resurrect us by his own power .
Do you not know that your bodies are the members of Christ ? Shall I then take the members of Christ , and unite them with turn them into the members of a prostitute ? God forbid !
What ? Do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one united with her body ? For he said : » Two will be one flesh . «
He who is joined to the Lord is one united with him in spirit .
Flee from fornication ! Every sin that a man does is outside his body . But he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body .
What ? Do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit ? That one Greek : » hos he ho « which , that one is in you . You received it from God . You are not your own .
You are bought with a price ! Therefore glorify God in your body .
Concerning the things that you wrote to me : It is good for a man not to touch have sex with a woman .
Nevertheless , to avoid fornication , let every man have his own wife , and let every woman have her own husband .
Let the husband fulfill his marital duties to his wife and also the wife to her husband .
The wife has no authority over her own body , but her husband does . Likewise also the husband has no authority over his own body , but his wife does .
Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent for a time . That way you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer . Then come together again , that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control .
But I speak this by concession and not by commandment .
I prefer that all men were as I am . But every man has his proper gift from God , one after this manner , and another after that .
I say therefore to the unmarried and widows , it is good for them if they stay unmarried like me .
But if they cannot control themselves , let them marry . It is better to marry than to be inflamed with lust .
To the married I command , yet not I , but the Lord commands do not let the wife depart from her husband .
If she leaves , let her remain unmarried or become reconciled to her husband . A husband should not divorce his wife .
To the others , I speak and not the Lord . If any brother has an unbelieving wife and she is willing to live with him he should not divorce her .
And the woman who has an unbelieving husband , and he is willing to live with her , she should not divorce him .
For the wife sanctifies the unbelieving husband , and the husband sanctifies the unbelieving wife . Otherwise your children would be unclean . But now they are holy .
If the unbelieving leave , let him leave . A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases for God has called us to peace .
Wife how do you know that you will save your husband ? Husband how do you know whether you will save your wife ?
But as God has distributed to every person so let him walk . And so I ordain in all the congregations .
Is any man called being circumcised ? He should not become uncircumcised . Is any called who is not circumcised ? He should not be circumcised .
Circumcision is nothing , and uncircumcision is nothing . Obey the commandments of God .
Each man should remain in the same condition in which he was called .
Were you called being a slave ? Do not let it worry you . But if you can become free , do so .
He who is called in the Lord , being a slave , is the Lord's freeman . Likewise also he who is called , being free , is Christ's slave .
You are bought with a price . Stop being slaves of men .
Brothers , let every man remain in the condition in which he was called . Abide with God .
Now concerning virgins I have no commandment from the Lord . Yet I give my opinion as one who has obtained the mercy of the Lord to be faithful .
Because of the present distress I think it is good for you to remain as you are .
Are you bound to a wife ? Do not seek a release . Are you released from a wife ? Do not seek a wife .
If you marry you have not sinned . If a virgin marries she has not sinned . Those who marry will face many problems in this life and I want to spare you .
I will say this brothers the time remaining is short . So from now on those who have wives should be like those who have none .
Those who weep should be like those who do not weep . And those who rejoice should be like those who do not rejoice , and those who buy like those who do not possess .
Those who use this world should not abuse it , for the fashion of this world is passing away .
I want you to be free from anxiety . He who is unmarried cares for the things that belong to the Lord , how he may please the Lord .
But he who is married cares for the things that are of the world , how he may please his wife .
There is difference also between a wife and a virgin . The unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord , that she may be holy both in body and in spirit . She who is married cares for the things of the world , how she may please her husband .
I say this for your benefit and not to restrict you . I show you how to live a noble life of devotion to the Lord without being distracted by other things .
If any man thinks he behaves improperly toward his virgin , if she is past her youth , let him do what he will , he does not sin if they get married .
Nevertheless he who stands steadfast in his heart , having no necessity , but has power over his own will , and has so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virginity he does well .
So then he who gives his virginity in marriage does well ; but he who does not get married does even better .
The wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives . If her husband dies , she is free to marry whom she wishes , only in the Lord .
But she is happier if she remains as she is . This is my opinion and I think I also have the Spirit of God .
Concerning things offered to idols , we know that we all have knowledge . Knowledge puffs up , but love builds up .
If any man thinks he knows any thing , he really knows nothing , according to what he ought to know .
But if any man loves God , God knows him .
Concerning the eating of food offered in sacrifice to idols , we know that an idol is nothing in the world , and that there is no other God but one .
There are those called gods in heaven or on earth . There are many gods and many lords .
But to us there is but one God , the Father . All things come from him and we live for him . And there is one Lord Jesus Christ . All things were made through him and we were made through him .
Not all people know this . Some eat food offered to idols and their conscience being weak is defiled .
But food will not recommend us to God . If we do not eat we are not worse . If we eat we are not better .
Be careful that this freedom does not become a stumbling block to those who are weak .
If any man with knowledge sees you having a meal from an idol’s temple , will the conscience of the weak one be emboldened encouraged to eat food offered to idols ?
And because of your knowledge the weak brother will perish . Christ died for him !
When you sin against your brothers and wound their weak conscience , you sin against Christ .
If food makes my brother stumble I will eat no food at all so I do not make my brother stumble .
Am I not an apostle ? Am I not free ? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord ? Are you not my work in the Lord ?
If I am not an apostle to others , I most certainly am to you , for you are the seal stamp proof of my apostleship in the Lord .
My answer defense to those who examine me is as follows :
Do we have a right to eat and drink ?
Do we have a right to lead a sister as a wife just like other apostles , and as brothers of the Lord , and Cephas ?
Or is it only Barnabas and I who do not have the right to refrain from secular work ?
Does a soldier serve at his own expense ? Does the one who plants a vineyard not eat of the fruit it produces ? Who shepherds a flock and does not eat some of the milk from the flock ?
I say this from a human point of view . Does the law say the same thing ?
It is written in the Law of Moses : You should not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treads threshes out the grain . Does God care only about oxen ?
Or did he say it for our benefit ? This is written for our benefit without a doubt ! He who plows should plow in hope . Likewise he who threshes in hope should be a partaker of his hope .
If we sow spiritual seed in you , is it too much if we reap material things ?
If others are partakers of the right over you , should we also partake ? Nevertheless we have not used this power ! We suffer all things , lest we should hinder the good news of Christ .
Do you not know that they who minister about holy things live off the things of the temple ? And they who wait at the altar are partakers with the altar ?
Even so , has the Lord ordained that they who preach the good news should earn their living from the good news ?
But I have used none of these rights ! Neither have I written these things , that it should be done to me . It would be better for me to die , than that any man should make my reason for boasting void .
Though I preach the good news I do not brag about it . Preaching the good news is my duty obligation and I must do it ! It would be terrible if I did not preach the good news !
For if I do this thing willingly , I have a reward . But if I do it against my will , I am just performing the trust of the good news committed to me .
What is my reward then ? When I preach the good news , I may offer the good news of Christ without charge . That is way I do not abuse my power in the good news .
For , though I am free from all persons , yet I have made myself a servant to all , that I might gain more .
To the Jews I became as a Jew , that I might gain the Jews . To those under the Law , as under the Law , that I might gain those under the Law .
To those without Law I became like those without Law that I might gain them . I am not without law to God , but under the law to toward of Christ .
To the weak I became as the weak , that I might gain the weak . I am made all things to all men , that I might by all means save some .
And this I do for the sake of the good news that I might be a partaker of it with others .
Do you not know that they who run in a race all run , but one receives the prize ? So run that you may obtain the prize .
Every man taking part in the contest is temperate in all things . They do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we do it to receive an incorruptible crown .
I do not run without definite aim purpose and I do not fight like a man beating the air .
But I discipline my body , and bring it into subjection , so that after I have preached to others I will not be disqualified .
Brothers , I do not want you to be ignorant about how all our fathers were under the cloud , and all passed through the sea .
They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea .
They all ate the same spiritual meal .
They all drank the same spiritual drink , for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them . That Rock was represented symbolic of Christ !
God was not pleased with most of them . And their bodies were scattered in the wilderness .
Now these things were examples for us . They teach us not to lust after evil things like they did .
Do not be idolaters like some of them . It is written : The people sat down to eat and drink , and stood up to play .
Do not commit fornication like some of them committed . Twenty three thousand of them died in one day .
Do not test Jehovah like some of them also did and were destroyed by serpents .
Do not grumble like some of them grumbled . Venomous snakes killed them .
These things happened for examples , and they are written for our instruction , upon whom the end of the ages has come .
Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed that he does not fall .
No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to man . God is faithful and he will not allow you to be tempted beyond your limits . He will make a way out , that you will be able to endure it .
My dearly beloved , flee run away from idolatry .
I speak as to wise men . You judge what I say .
The cup of blessing we bless , is it not the sharing of the blood of Christ ? The bread we break , is it not the sharing of the body of Christ ?
For we being many are one-bread and one-body . We are all partakers of that one bread .
Is physical Israel the ones who eat the sacrifices , the partakers of the altar ?
What do I mean ? That the idol is anything , or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is anything ?
But I say , that the things that the nations sacrifice , they sacrifice to demons , and not to God . I do not want you to have fellowship with demons .
You cannot drink the cup of Jehovah and the cup of demons . You cannot be partakers of the Jehovah's Table and of the table of demons .
Do we provoke Jehovah to rivalry indignation anger ? Are we stronger than he ?
All things are lawful for me , but all things are not expedient profitable . All things are lawful for me , but all things do not build up confirm strengthen .
Let no one seek his own advantage , but that of the other person .
Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without asking questions for the sake of conscience .
For the earth and that which fills it is Jehovah’s .
If a nonbeliever invites you to a feast and you feel you must go eat whatever is set before you , asking no question for conscience sake .
But if any man says to you : » This is offered in sacrifice to idols , « do not eat for the sake of the one who said it and for conscience sake .
Conscience , I say , not your own , but of the other : Yet why is my freedom judged by another man's conscience ?
For if I by grace am a partaker , why is evil spoken about me concerning that for which I give thanks ?
Whether you eat , or drink , or whatever you do , do everything to the glory of God .
Do not stumble or offend do not lead into sin , neither to the Jews , nor to the nations , nor to the congregation of God .
Even as I please all men in all things , not seeking my own good , but the good of many , that they may be saved .
Be followers imitators of me , even as I also am of Christ .
Now I praise you , brothers , because you remember me in all things , and carefully follow the teachings precepts doctrine just as I delivered them to you .
I would have you know , that the head authority of every man is Christ ; and the head of the woman is the man ; and the head of Christ is God .
Every man who prays or prophesies having his head covered dishonors his head .
But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head . She is the same as if she had her head shaved .
For if the woman were not covered , let her also be shaved . But if it is a shame for a woman to have her head shaved , let her be covered .
For a man should not cover his head , for he is the image and glory of God . But the woman is the glory of the man .
For the man is not from the woman ; but the woman is from the man .
Neither was man created for woman but woman for man .
That is why the woman should have a sign of authority on her head because of the angels .
However in the Lord , both men and women exist together . Not one without the other .
For as woman is from man , even so is man also from woman . But all things are from God !
Judge in yourselves . Is it proper that women pray to God uncovered ?
Does not even nature itself teach you , that , if men have long hair , it is a shame ?
But if a woman has long hair , it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering .
If anyone is contentious about this we have no other practice , neither do the congregations of God .
Now in this that I declare to you that I do not praise you . For you come together not for the better but for the worse .
For first of all , when you come together in the congregation , I hear that there are divisions among you and I partly believe it .
For there must be also heresies among you that they that are approved may be made manifest among you .
When you come together to one place , this is not to eat the Lord's Supper .
For in eating every one goes ahead with out waiting for everybody else . One is hungry and another is drunk .
Do you not have houses in which to eat and drink ? Or do you despise the congregation of God , and shame them that have nothing ? What shall I say to you ? Shall I praise you in this ? I will not praise you !
For I received from the Lord that which I delivered to you , that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread .
And when he had given thanks , he broke it , and said , » Take and eat . This represents is my body , which is broken for you . Do this in remembrance of me . «
In the same manner , after supper , he took the cup , saying , » This cup represents is the new covenant of my blood . Drink this as often as you do it in remembrance of me . «
For as often as you eat this bread , and drink this cup , you proclaim the Lord's death till he comes .
Whoever shall eat this bread , and drink this cup of the Lord , unworthily , shall be guilty of sinning against falsely representing the body and blood of the Lord .
Let a man examine himself before he eats of that bread , and drinks of that cup .
For he that eats and drinks unworthily , eats and drinks damnation to himself , not discerning not judging rightly the Lord's body .
For this cause many are weak and sickly among you , and many sleep .
For if we would judge ourselves , we should not be judged .
But when we are judged , Jehovah disciplines us , that we should not be destroyed condemned with the world .
When you come together to eat , wait for one another .
If any man is hungry let him eat at home . That way you come together without condemnation . I will give direction to care for other matters when I come .
Concerning spiritual gifts , brothers , I do not want you to be without knowledge .
You know that you were of the nations , carried away and led by mute idols .
I want you to understand that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed . And no person can say , » Jesus is the Lord , « except by the Holy Spirit .
There are different gifts , but the same Spirit .
There are differences of administrations , but the same Lord .
And there are different operations , but it is the same God who works in all .
The manifestation expression of the Spirit is given to everyone for a beneficial purpose .
For to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit ; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit ;
To another faith by the same Spirit ; to another the gifts of healing by the one Spirit ;
To another the workings of miracles and to another prophesy . To another discerning of spirits ; to another different kinds of tongues ; to another the interpretation of tongues .
But in all these the same Spirit works , making a distribution to each one as he God wills .
For as the body is one , and has many members , and all the members of that one body , being many and are one body , so also is Christ .
For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body , whether we are Jews or people of the nations , whether we are bond or free ; we were all made to drink of one Spirit .
For the body is not one member , but many .
If the foot should say : » Because I am not the hand , I am not of the body ; « is it therefore not of the body ?
If the ear should say : » Because I am not the eye , I am not of the body ; « is it therefore not of the body ?
If the whole body were an eye , where is the hearing ? If the whole were hearing , where is the smelling ?
Has God set the members of the body , every one of them , just as it pleased him ?
And if they were all one member , where would the body be ?
But now they are many members , yet they are one body .
And the eye cannot say to the hand , » I have no need of you : « nor again the head to the feet , » I have no need of you . «
Those members of the body , which seem to be weaker , are necessary .
And those members of the body that we think to be less honorable , we offer these more honors . Our less acceptable parts have more abundant acceptability .
For our acceptable parts have no need . But God has assembled the body together , having given more abundant honor to the part that was lacking .
There should be no division in the body . So the members should have the same care for each other .
When one member suffers all the members suffer with it . When one member is honored , all the members rejoice with it .
Now you are the body of Christ , and members individually .
God has appointed some in the congregation : first apostles , second prophets , third teachers , after that miracles , then gifts of healings , helpers , abilities to direct , different tongues .
Are all apostles ? Are all prophets ? Are all teachers ? Are all workers of miracles ?
Do all have the gifts of healing ? Do all speak with tongues ? Do all interpret ?
Zealously seek earnestly desire the best gifts . Yet I show you a more excellent way .
Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels , and do not have love , I have become like loud sounding brass , or a clashing cymbal .
If I have the gift of prophesy , and know all secrets and all knowledge , and though I have all faith so as to remove mountains , but do not have love , I am nothing .
And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor , and surrender my body to be burned , but do not have love , I gain nothing .
Love is patient . Love is kind . Love is not jealous . Love does not brag and is not arrogant proud .
Love does not act indecently . It is not selfish . It is not provoked and does not take into account a wrong suffered .
Love does not rejoice with evil , but rejoices with the truth .
It bears all things , believes all things , hopes all things , and endures all things .
Love never fails . Where there are gifts of prophecy , they will be done away . Where there are tongues , they will cease . Where there is knowledge , it will be done away .
For we know in part and we prophesy in part .
When the perfect comes , the partial imperfect incomplete will be done away .
When I was a child , I used to speak like a child , think like a child , and reason like a child . When I became an adult I did away with childish things .
For now we see in a mirror dimly , and then we will see face to face . Now I know in part , but then I will know fully just as I also have been fully known .
Faith , hope and love remain . These three ! The greatest of these is love !
Pursue love , yet zealously desire spiritual gifts , especially prophesy proclaiming God’s Word .
For the person who speaks in an unknown tongue does not speak to men , but to God . No man understands him . He speaks secrets by the spirit .
But the person who prophesies proclaims God’s Word openly speaks to men to build up , encourage and comfort .
The person who speaks in an unknown tongue enlightens himself ; but he who declares God’s Word enlightens the entire congregation !
I would like it that you all speak with tongues , but I prefer that you prophesy . The person who announces teaches preaches God’s Word is greater than the person who speaks with tongues . The person who speaks with tongues should have an interpreter so the congregation may receive understanding and knowledge .
Now , brothers , if I come to you speaking with tongues , what shall I profit you , except I shall speak to you either by revelation , or by knowledge , or by prophesying , or by doctrine ?
Inanimate objects that make a sound , whether pipe or harp , except they give a distinction in the sounds , how shall it be known what is piped or harped ?
If the trumpet gives an unclear sound , who will prepare himself for the battle ?
The same for you unless you utter by the tongue words easy to understand , how will it be known what is spoken ? For you will speak into the air .
There are many kinds of languages in the world , and none of them is without meaning .
Therefore if I do not know the meaning of what someone is saying I will be a foreigner to him that speaks . And he that speaks will be a foreigner to me too .
As much as you are zealous for spiritual gifts , strive to build-up increase the enlightenment understanding of the congregation .
Let the one who speaks in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret what he says .
For if I pray in an unknown tongue , my spirit prays , but my understanding mind is unfruitful .
What is it then ? I will pray with the spirit , and I will pray with the understanding Greek : nous : mind also . I will sing with the spirit , and I will sing with the understanding mind also .
When you bless with the spirit , how will the audience of the unlearned say Amen at your giving of thanks , seeing he does not understand what you said ?
For you give thanks well , but the other is not given understanding .
I thank God that I speak with tongues more then all of you .
Yet in the congregation I would rather speak five words with my understanding than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue .
Brothers , do not be like children in understanding . When it comes to evil be innocent children but in your thinking be mature adults .
It is written in the law : » With men of other tongues and lips of foreigners I will speak to this people . Even then they will not listen to me , « said Jehovah .
Therefore speaking in tongues is a sign not for believers , but for those who do not believe . Prophesying proclaiming God’s Word serves the believer and not the unbeliever .
If therefore the whole congregation comes together in one place , and all speak with tongues , and the unlearned , or unbelievers , come there will they not say that you are out of your mind ?
But if all proclaim God’s Word and an unbeliever comes there he is convinced by all .
The secrets of his heart are made known . So falling down on his face he will worship God , and report , » God is truly among you . «
How is it then , brothers ? When you come together , every one of you has a psalm , has a doctrine , has a tongue , has a revelation , and has an interpretation . Let all things be done to clarify and offer understanding !
If anyone speaks in an unknown tongue , let it be by two , or at the most by three . It should be orderly by plan and someone must interpret .
But if there is no interpreter , let the speaker keep silence in the congregation and speak to himself and to God .
Let two or three prophets speak and let the others listen .
If there is a revelation to another while sitting there , let the others keep quiet .
You may all prophesy one by one in turn that all may learn , and all may be comforted .
Let the prophets control the spirits minds mental disposition of the prophets .
For God is not the author of confusion , but of peace , as in all the congregations of the holy ones .
Let women keep silent in the congregations . They are not permitted to speak . They must be in submission as it says in the law .
When they want to learn something , let them ask their husbands at home . For it is improper for a woman to speak in the congregation .
Did the word of God originate with you ? Or are you the only people it has reached ?
If any man thinks himself to be a prophet , or spiritual , let him acknowledge that the things that I write to you are the commandments of the Lord .
But if any man does not recognize understand this he will not be recognized .
Seek to prophesy brothers , and do not forbid speaking with tongues .
Let all things be done decently and in order .
Brothers , I declared the good news to you . You have received it and should continue strong in it .
You will be saved through the good news if you hold fast to the word I preached to you . That way you will not believe in vain .
First of all , I delivered to you what I also received , how Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures .
He was buried , and he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures .
He was seen by Peter and then by the twelve apostles .
More than five hundred brothers saw him at the same time after that . Most of them remain to this day , but some have fallen asleep in death .
Then he was seen by James , and then by all the apostles .
And last of all I also saw him , as of one with an untimely birth .
I am the least of the apostles and do not deserve to be called an apostle , because I persecuted the people of God .
By the divine influence of God I am what I am . His grace was not given to me in vain for I labored more than all of them . Yet it was not I . It was the divine influence and favor of God in me .
Therefore whether they preached or I preached , you believed .
If we preached that Christ was raised from the dead , how can some among you say there is no resurrection of the dead ?
If there is no resurrection of the dead , then Christ has not risen .
And if Christ has not been raised , then our preaching is worth nothing , and your faith is also without value .
We are found to be false witnesses of God because we have testified that God raised Christ from the dead . If he did not raise him up from the dead then the dead are not raised up .
For if the dead are not raised up then Christ has not been raised .
And if Christ is not resurrected , your faith is worth nothing , and you are still in your sins .
Then they also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished .
If in this life only we have hope in Christ , we are of all men most miserable pitiable .
Christ has risen from the dead , and has become the first fruits of those who slept in death .
Death came because of what one man did . The resurrection of the dead also comes because of what one man did .
In Adam all die , even so in Christ all shall be made alive .
Everyone will be raised to life in the right order : Christ the first fruits and afterward those who belong to Christ at the time of his coming .
In the end Christ will deliver the kingdom to God the Father . Christ will destroy every ruler and all authority and all power .
For he Christ must rule as king until he God puts all enemies under his feet his control .
The last enemy to be destroyed will be death .
According to the Scriptures : God has placed all things under his control subjection . But when he said all things are placed under him , it is with the exception of God . For God is the one who placed all things under him Christ .
When all things shall be subdued under the Son , then the Son will also be subjected to God who put all things under him , that God may be all in all ruler over everything .
What will they do who are baptized for the dead , if the dead do not rise at all ? Why are they then baptized for the dead ?
Why do we stand in jeopardy in danger every hour ?
I face death daily even as I rejoice over you in Christ Jesus our Lord .
If I have fought with beasts at Ephesus , what advantage was it to me if the dead do not rise ? Let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die .
Do not be deceived : Bad company corrupts good morals .
Wake up to righteousness and do not sin . Some do not have knowledge of God : I speak this to your shame .
But someone will say : How are the dead raised up ? And with what body do they come ?
You fool , that which you sow is not alive unless it first dies .
That which you sow , you sow not that body that will develop , but bare grain , it may be of wheat , or of some other grain :
But God gives it a body as it pleased him , and to every seed his own body .
All flesh is not the same flesh : but there is one kind of flesh of men , another flesh of beasts , another of fishes , and another of birds .
There are also celestial heavenly bodies and terrestrial earthly bodies . The glory of the celestial is one thing and the glory of the terrestrial is another .
There is one glory of the sun , and another glory of the moon , and another glory of the stars . For one star differs from another star in glory .
So also is the resurrection of the dead . It is sown in corruption . It is raised in incorruption .
It is sown in dishonor . It is raised in glory . It is sown in weakness and it is raised in power .
It is sown a natural body and it is raised a spiritual body . There is a natural body and there is a spiritual body .
Thus it is written : » The first man Adam was made a living being . « The last Adam became a life giving spirit !
How is it the first is not spiritual , but that which is natural ; and afterward that which is spiritual .
The first man is from the earth , earthy : the second man is from heaven .
As is the earthy so are those who are of the earth . And as is the heavenly , so are those who are of heaven .
And as we have borne the image of the earthy , we shall also bear the image of the heavenly .
Now this I say , brothers , that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God . Corruption may not inherit incorruption .
Behold , I show you a secret . We shall not all sleep , but we shall all be changed ,
In a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last reverberation of the trumpet : for the trumpet shall sound , and the dead shall be raised incorruptible , and we shall be changed .
This corruptible must put on incorruption , and this mortal must put on immortality .
When this corruptible shall be clothed with Greek : enduo : dressed , put on incorruption , and this mortal shall be clothed with immortality , then the saying will come true : » Death is swallowed up in victory . «
» O death , where is your sting power to hurt ? O grave , where is your victory ? «
The sting of death is sin ; and the strength of sin is the law .
But thanks to God , because he gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ .
Therefore , my beloved brothers , be steadfast and unmovable . Always have plenty to do in the work of the Lord , for you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord .
Now concerning the collection for the holy ones , you should do the same as I told the congregations of Galatia .
On one day of the week let every one of you set something aside , as God has prospered you , that there be no contributions collected when I come . Greek : heis , number one
When I come , whomever you approve by your letters , I will send to bring your gift to Jerusalem .
If it is fitting that I also go they will go with me .
Now I will come to you when I pass through Macedonia , for I do pass through Macedonia .
And it may be that I will stay there and winter with you , that you may send me on my journey where ever I go .
I will not see you now by the way ; but I plan to stay a while with you , if the God permits .
I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost .
For a great door that leads to activity is opened to me . Yet there are many people working against me .
Now if Timothy comes , see that he may be with you without fear , for he works the work of God , as I also do .
Let no one despise him . But conduct him in peace that he may come to me , for I look for him with the brothers .
Concerning our brother Apollos , I greatly desired him to come to you with the brothers but his will was not at all to come at this time . He will come when he has a convenient time .
Be alert be watchful and stand fast be vigilant persevere in the faith , carry on as men be courageous , be strong .
Do everything with love .
I exhort you , brothers , you know the house of Stephanas , that it is the first fruits of Achaia , and that they have devoted themselves to the ministry of the holy ones .
That you submit yourselves to such , and to every one that helps with us , and labors .
I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus . For they have supplied what was lacking on your part .
For they have refreshed my spirit and yours . Therefore acknowledge them .
The congregations of Asia greet you . Aquila and Priscilla greet you in the Lord , with the congregation that is in their house .
All the brothers greet you . Greet one another with a holy kiss .
The greeting from me Paul is with my own hand .
If any man does not love the Lord Jesus Christ , let him be accursed . Come O Lord !
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with you .
My love be with you all in Christ Jesus . Amen .
Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God , and Timothy our brother , to the congregation of God at Corinth , with all the holy ones throughout Achaia :
May you have grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of mercies and God of all comfort .
He comforts us in all our trouble , that we may be able to comfort those who also have trouble , through the comfort with which we are comforted from God .
For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us , even so our comfort also abounds through Christ .
If we are afflicted , it is for your comfort and salvation . If we are comforted , it is for your comfort . It works through patience and longsuffering and is the same sufferings that we also suffer .
Our hope for you is steadfast ; knowing that , as you are partakers of the sufferings , so you also partake of the comfort .
We do not want you to be ignorant , brothers , concerning our affliction that began in Asia . We were weighed down exceedingly , beyond our power , so much that we despaired even of life .
Yes , we have had the sentence of death within ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in God who raises the dead .
God delivered us out of so great a death , and will deliver us . We have set our hope on him . He will deliver us !
You also helped with your prayer on our behalf . Many may give thanks for the gift granted to us .
This is our pride and testimony of conscience . In holiness and Godly sincerity we behaved ourselves in the world , and more abundantly toward you . It was not by fleshly wisdom but by the grace of God .
For we write no other things to you , than what you read or even acknowledge , and I hope you will acknowledge to the end :
as also you did acknowledge us in part , that we are your reason to be proud , even as you also are ours , in the day of our Lord Jesus .
In this confidence I was willing to come to you first that you might have a second benefit .
To pass by you to Macedonia , and again from Macedonia to come to you , and to be helped by you on my journey to Judea .
When I planned this was I unfaithful ? Or in other things do I perform according to the flesh . With me should there be a yes or a no ?
But as God is faithful , our word toward you is not yes and no .
For the Son of God , Jesus Christ , whom we , preached among you even by me and Silvanus and Timothy , was not yes and no , but in him is yes .
All the promises of God in him are yes . Also in his is the Amen , to the glory of God through us .
He who establishes us with you in Christ , and anointed us , is God .
He also sealed us , and gave us the guarantee of the Spirit in our hearts .
But I call God for a witness against me . To spare you I did not come to Corinth .
We do not control your faith . We are fellow workers for your joy : for you stand fast in faith .
I decided this for myself that I would not come again to you with sorrow .
For if I make you sad , who then makes me glad ? It is the same one whom I made sad .
I wrote this very thing that when I came , I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice . I have confidence in you all , that my joy is the joy of you all .
For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears . Not that you should be made sorry , but that you might know the love that I have more abundantly for you .
But if any has caused sorrow , he has caused sorrow , not to me , but in part that I press not too heavily to you all .
Sufficient to such a one is this punishment that was inflicted by the many .
To the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him , lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his excess sorrow .
I urge you to confirm your love toward him .
I write for this purpose , that I might put you to the test , whether you are obedient in all things .
Whoever you forgive , I also forgive . What I have forgiven , if I have forgiven anything , for your sakes I have forgiven it in the presence of Christ ,
that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan : for we are not ignorant of his devices .
Now when I came to Troas for the good news of Christ , and when a door was opened to me in the Lord ,
I had no relief for my spirit , because I did not find Titus my brother : but leaving them , I went to Macedonia .
Thanks to God , who always leads us in triumph triumphal procession in Christ . He makes known through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place .
For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God . We are an aroma for those who are saved and those who perish .
To the one an aroma of death leading to death and to the other an aroma from life to life . And who is sufficient for these things ?
For we are not as the many , corrupting the word of God ; but sincere and from God . We speak in Christ in the sight of God .
Are we beginning again to commend ourselves ? Or do we need , as some do , letters of commendation to you or from you ?
You are our letter , written in our hearts , known and read by all men .
It is known that you are a letter of Christ , ministered by us , written not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God . It is not written on tablets of stone , but on tablets of flesh that are of the heart .
We have such confidence through Christ toward God .
We are not adequate by ourselves to account for anything . Our adequacy is from God .
He also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant . This is a covenant not of the letter , but of the Spirit : for the letter kills , but the Spirit gives life .
The ministry of death was written and engraved on stones . Glory came with it so that the children of Israel could not look steadfastly upon the face of Moses . And this glory was passing away .
How shall the ministry of the Spirit not be with glory ?
For if the ministry of condemnation has glory then the ministry of righteousness would exceed in glory .
Even what was glorious had no glory in this respect , by reason of the greater glory .
If that which passes away was with glory , that which remains is even more glorious .
Since we have such a hope we use great boldness of speech .
We are not like Moses , who put a veil upon his face , that the children of Israel should not look steadily on the end of that which was passing away :
Their minds were blinded . Until this day the same veil remains at the reading of the old covenant . It is not revealed to them that Christ voided it .
But to this day , whenever Moses is read , a veil lies upon their heart .
When one turns to God , the veil is taken away .
Now God is the Spirit and where the Spirit of God is , there is liberty freedom .
We all , with unveiled face , behold as in a mirror the glory of God and are transformed into the same image from glory to glory , exactly as from God’s Spirit .
We have this ministry to do , even as we obtained mercy , we do not lose heart .
We have renounced the hidden things of shame . And we do not walk in craftiness and deceit . We do not adulterate the word of God . But by the manifestation of the truth we commend ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God .
If our gospel is veiled , it is veiled to those who perish .
The god of this age world religious , social , political , and economic arrangement has blinded the minds of unbelievers that the light of the good news of the glory of Christ , who is the image of God , should not shine on them .
We do not preach about ourselves , but about Christ Jesus as Lord . We are your servants for Jesus' sake .
God said : Light will shine out of darkness . He shined in our hearts . He gave the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face presence person of Jesus Christ .
We have this treasure in earthen vessels that the power beyond what is normal may be from God , and not from ourselves .
We are pressed afflicted troubled on every side , but not crushed . We are perplexed yet not to despair .
We are persecuted , yet not forsaken . We are struck down , yet not destroyed .
We always carry in the body the death of Jesus , that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our body .
For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus' sake , that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our mortal flesh .
So then death works in us , but life in you .
But having the same spirit attitude of faith , according to that which is written , I believe , and therefore I speak . We also believe , and therefore we also speak .
We know that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus , and will present us with you .
All things are for your sakes , that the grace , being multiplied through the many , may cause the thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God .
We do not give up ! Though our outward man is decaying , yet our inward man is renewed day by day .
Our light affliction is for the moment . It works more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory for us .
We do not look at the things that are seen , but at the things that are not seen . For the things that are seen are temporal for a season . But the things that are not seen are eternal .
We know that if our earthly house human body habitation of life is destroyed ; we have a building from God . It is an everlasting house in the heavens , not made with human hands .
In this we sigh in silent prayer , longing to be clothed with our habitation that is from heaven .
Indeed being clothed we will not be found naked .
While in this tabernacle we groan and sigh with prayer . We are concerned that we would be clothed with what is mortal and be swallowed up devoured by this life .
He that prepared us for this very purpose is God . He gave the Spirit to us as a guarantee pledge security .
We are always confident for we know that while we are at home in the body , we are absent from the Lord .
We walk by faith , not by sight .
We are of good courage , I say , and are willing to be absent from the body , and to be at home with the Lord .
We make it our aim , whether at home or absent , to be pleasing to him .
We must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ ; that each one may receive the things done in the body , according to what he has done , whether it is good or bad .
We know what it means to respect the Lord so we persuade others . God knows us and I hope that you know us in your hearts consciences .
We are not again commending ourselves to you . But we are giving you an occasion to be proud of us . That way you may have an answer for those who glory in appearance , and not in heart .
For if we are beside ourselves crazy insane it is to God . If we are of sound mind , it is to you .
For the love of Christ compels us to judge , that one died for all and therefore all died .
He died for all that those who live should no longer live for themselves , but for him who died for their sakes and rose again .
From now on we know no man according to the flesh : even though we have known Christ according to the flesh , yet now we know him so no longer .
If any man is in Christ , he is a new creature : the old things have passed away . Behold , they have become new .
All things are from God who reconciled us to himself through Christ . He gave the ministry of reconciliation to us .
God was reconciling the world to himself through Christ . He was not imputing their trespasses against them , for he had committed the word of reconciliation to us .
We are ambassadors for Christ , as though God were making entreaty through us . We implore you on behalf of Christ that you be reconciled to God .
He made the one who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf . That way we might become the righteousness of God in him .
Working together with him we plead with you not to receive the grace of God in vain to no purpose in emptiness .
For he said : At an acceptable time I listened to you . In a day of salvation I helped you . Behold , now is the acceptable time ; behold , now is the day of salvation !
Give no occasion for stumbling offence in anything that our ministry may not be blamed discredited .
In everything we commend ourselves , as ministers of God , in much patience , in afflictions , in necessities , in distresses ,
in beatings , in imprisonments , in tumults , in labors , in watching , in fasting ;
in pureness , in knowledge , in long-suffering , in kindness , in the Holy Spirit , in genuine love ,
in the word of truth , in the power of God ; by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left ,
by honor and dishonor , by evil report and good report ; as deceivers , and yet true ;
as unknown , and yet well known ; as dying , and behold , we live ; as chastened , and not killed ;
Also as sorrowful , yet always rejoicing ; as poor , yet making many rich ; as having nothing , and yet possessing all things .
O Corinthians , we have spoken openly to you , our figurative heart is wide open enlarged .
We do not restrict you , but you are restricted by your own affections .
Now in return for the same in like kind I speak as to my children , you also be open open your hearts wide !
Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers : for what fellowship does righteousness have with lawlessness ? Or what communion does light have with darkness ?
And what accord has Christ with Belial ? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever ?
And what agreement does a temple of God have with idols ? We are the temple of the living God . God said : I will dwell in them , and walk among them ; and I will be their God , and they will be my people .
Therefore come out from among them and be separate set off severed from them excluded from them , said Jehovah . Do not touch the unclean thing and I will receive you .
I will be a Father to you , and you will be to me sons and daughters , said Jehovah God the Almighty .
Having these promises , beloved , let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit , perfecting holiness with deep reverence for God .
Open your hearts to us . We wronged no person . We wronged and corrupted no one . We took advantage of no person .
I say it not to condemn you : for I have said before , that you are in our hearts to die together and live together .
Great is my confidence in you . Great is my boasting on your behalf . I am filled with comfort . I overflow with joy in our entire affliction .
When we came to Macedonia our flesh had no relief , but we were afflicted on every side , fighting on the outside and fears on the inside .
Nevertheless he who comforts the lowly , even God , comforted us by the coming of Titus .
This is not by his coming only , but also by the comfort he brought from you . He told us about your longing , your mourning , and your zeal for me so that I rejoiced yet more .
For though I made you sorry with my letter , I do not regret it . Though I did regret it for I see that that letter made you sorry , though but for a season ,
I now rejoice , not because you were made sorry , but that you were made sorry to repentance ; for you were made sorry after a godly fashion , that you might not suffer loss by us .
For godly sorrow works repentance leading to salvation . This is a repentance that brings no regret : but the sorrow of the world works death .
This very thing that you sorrowed in a godly manner : What diligence it made in you , what clearing of yourselves , what indignation , what fear , what longing , what zeal , yes what vindication ! You demonstrated yourself to innocent in the matter .
Although I wrote to you , I did not write for the sake of the one who did wrong , nor for the one who suffered the wrong , but that your earnest care for us might be made manifest to you in the sight of God .
Therefore we have been comforted in your comfort . We enjoyed our comfort the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus , because all of you have refreshed his mental disposition .
If in anything I have boasted about him to you , I was not put to shame ; but as we spoke all things to you in truth , so our boasting also which I made before Titus was found to be truth .
His affection is even greater for you as he remembers your obedience and how with reverence and trembling you received him .
I rejoice that in everything I am encouraged because of you .
We make known to you brothers the grace of God that has been given to the congregations of Macedonia .
Out of severe affliction they have an abundance of joy and their deep poverty abounds in the riches of their generosity .
For according to their ability , I bear witness , yes and beyond their power , they gave of their own accord .
They were very urgent in their concern for this grace and the fellowship in the ministering to the holy ones .
This is not as we hoped . First they gave their own selves to the Lord , and to us by the will of God .
We exhorted Titus , that as he made a beginning before , so he would also complete in you this grace .
But as you have plenty of everything , in faith , and speech , and knowledge , and in all earnestness , and in your love for us , see that you have plenty of this undeserved kindness also .
I speak not by way of commandment , but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love .
For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ . Though he was rich , yet for your sakes he became poor , that you through his poverty might become rich .
I give my judgment : for this is expedient for you , who were the first to make a beginning a year ago , not only to do , but also to will .
But now complete the doing . There was the eager will , so there may be the completion also out of your ability .
For if the readiness is there , it is acceptable according to what a man has , not according to what he does not have .
I do not say this for the ease of others and for your affliction
but by equality : your abundance being a supply at this present time for their want , that their abundance also may become a supply for your want ; that there may be equality :
as it is written , He that gathered much had nothing over ; and he that gathered little had no lack .
But thanks to God , who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus .
For he accepted indeed our exhortation ; but being himself very earnest , he went forth to you of his own accord .
And we have sent together with him the brother , whose praise in the good news has spread through all the congregations ,
and not only so , but who was also appointed by the congregations to travel with us in the matter of this grace , which is ministered by us to the glory of the Lord , and to show our readiness .
Avoid this , that any man should blame us in the matter of this bounty that is ministered by us :
for we think of honorable things , not only in the sight of God , but also in the sight of men .
We send our brother with them , whom we have many times proved diligent in many things , but now much more diligent , by reason of the great confidence which he has in you .
Whether any inquire about Titus , he is my partner and my fellow-worker to you or our brothers , they are the messengers of the congregations , and they are the glory of Christ .
Show to them as representatives of the congregations the quality of your love , and of our boasting on your behalf .
I do not need to write you about the ministry to the holy ones .
I know you are ready and I boast about to the Macedonians . That Achaia has been prepared since last year . Your zeal stirred up many of them .
But I have sent the brothers that our boasting about you may not be made void in this respect . Even as I said , you may be prepared :
Lest by any means , if any from Macedonia come with me and find you unprepared , we , not to speak of you , should be put to shame in this respect .
I thought it necessary therefore to request the brothers to go before me to you , and prepare your generous gift before hand , that the same might be ready as a gift and not extortion .
He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly . He who sows bountifully will reap bountifully .
Let each man do according as he has purposed in his heart : not grudgingly , or of necessity : for God loves a cheerful giver .
God is able to make all grace abound toward you . You have plenty of everything you need and should abound in every good work .
As it is written : He has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor . His righteousness abides forever .
The one who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing , and increase the fruits of your righteousness .
You will be made rich in everything . And you can be generous on every occasion . This will cause thanksgiving to God through us .
This service not only takes care of the needs of the holy ones , but also abounds with many expressions of thanksgiving to God .
The proof of this ministry is that they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the good news of Christ , and for your liberal sharing with them and all men .
They pray for you because of the surpassing grace of God in you .
Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift !
Now I Paul myself entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ , I who in your presence am lowly among you , but being absent am of good courage toward you .
I ask that when I am present I need not be bold with the confidence with which I propose to be courageous against some , who regard us as if we walked according to the flesh .
For though we walk in the flesh , we do not war according to the flesh .
The weapons we use in our fight are not of the flesh but God's powerful weapons , which we use to destroy strongholds . We destroy false arguments .
We cast down imaginations , and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God . We bring every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ .
We are ready to punish all disobedience , when your obedience is complete .
You look at the things that are before you . If any man trusts in himself that he is Christ's , let him consider this again within himself that , even as he is Christ's , so also are we .
I should boast a great deal concerning the authority the Lord gave us to build you up , and not to tear you down , I would not be put to shame .
I may not seem as if I would terrify you by my letters .
For , His letters , they say , are weighty and strong . But his bodily presence is weak and his speech of no account .
Let a person like this take this into account : what we are in word by letters when we are absent , such we will also be in deed when we are present .
For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with certain of them that commend themselves . But they measure themselves by themselves , and compare themselves with themselves . They are without understanding .
But we will not boast beyond our measure , but according to the measure of the province that God apportioned to us as a measure , to reach even to you .
For we are not overstretching ourselves though we did not reach to you . We reached out to you with the good news of Christ .
We did not boast beyond our assignment in other men's labors . Having hope that , as your faith grows , we shall be made great among you according to our territory for further abundance .
Let us preach the good news to the parts beyond you . Let us not boast in someone else’s territory in concerning things ready for our hand .
But he who boasts let him boast in Jehovah !
It is not he that commends himself that is approved . It is the one whom Jehovah commends .
I hope you can put up with me in a little foolishness : but indeed you do put up with me .
For I am zealous over you with a godly fervor ardor zeal ! For I promised you to one husband , that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ .
But I fear , lest by any means , as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness , your minds will be lead away from the simplicity and the purity cleanness that is toward Christ .
If someone comes and preaches another Jesus , whom we did not preach , or if you receive a different spirit , which you did not receive , or a different good news , which you did not accept , you do well to put up with him .
For I do not consider myself inferior to the super apostles .
Though I am unskilled in speech , yet I am not in knowledge . We have in every way made this evident to you in all things .
Or did I commit a sin in abasing myself that you might be exalted , because I preached to you the good news of God without charge ?
I robbed other congregations , taking pay from them that I might minister to you .
When I was present with you and was in want , I was not a burden on any man . For the brothers , when they came from Macedonia , supplied the measure of my want ; and in everything I kept myself from being burdensome to you , and so I will continue to do the same .
As the truth of Christ is in me , no man shall stop me from doing this boasting in the regions of Achaia .
Why ? Is it because I do not love you ? God knows I do !
But what I do , I will do , that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion ; that in whatever matter they boast , they may be found equal with me .
For such men are false apostles , deceitful workers , fashioning themselves into apostles of Christ .
And no wonder for even Satan fashions himself into an angel of light .
It is no great thing therefore if his ministers also fashion themselves as ministers of righteousness , whose end shall be according to their works .
I say again , let no man think me foolish . If you do , yet receive me as foolish that I also may boast a little .
That which I speak , I speak not after the Lord , but in foolishness , in this confidence of boasting .
Seeing that many boast according to the flesh , I will boast also .
You being wise tolerate the foolish .
You suffer , if a man brings you into bondage , if a man devours you , if a man takes advantage of you , if a man exalts himself , if a man strikes you on the face .
I speak concerning reproach , as though we had been weak . If any are bold , I speak foolishly for I am also bold .
Are they Hebrews ? So am I . Are they Israelites ? So am I . Are they the seed of Abraham ? So am I !
Are they ministers of Christ ? I speak as a fool . I am more in labors more abundant , beaten beyond number , in prisons more frequent , in deaths often .
Of the Jews five times I received forty stripes less one .
Three times I was beaten with rods , once I was stoned , I suffered shipwreck three times , a night and a day I have spent in the deep .
In journeys often , in perils of waters , in perils of robbers , in perils by my own countrymen , in perils by the heathen , in perils in the city , in perils in the wilderness , in perils in the sea , in perils among false brothers ;
In weariness and painfulness , in watching often , in hunger and thirst , in fasting often , in cold and nakedness .
Beside those things that are from the outside , that which comes upon me daily , the care of all the congregations .
Who is weak , and I am not weak ? Who is offended , and I do not burn with indignation ?
If I need to boast , I will boast about the things that concern my infirmities .
The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , which is blessed forever knows I do not lie .
The governor under King Aretas put guards around the city of Damascus to catch me .
So I was let down in a basket through an opening in the wall and escaped from him .
I must brag , although it does not do any good . I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord .
I know a man in Christ , fourteen years ago whether in the body , I do not know ; or whether out of the body , I do not know ; God knows , such a one caught up even to the third heaven .
And I know such a man whether in the body , or apart from the body , I do not know ; God knows ,
how he was caught up into Paradise , and heard unspeakable words , which it is not lawful for a man to speak .
I will brag about this person , but I will not brag about myself unless it is about my weaknesses .
If I ever wanted to brag , I would not be a fool . Instead , I would be telling the truth . But I am going to spare you so that no one may think more of me than what he sees or hears about me .
I was given a painful physical ailment that will keep me from being puffed up with pride because of the many wonderful things I saw . It acts as Satan's messenger to beat me and keep me from being proud .
Three times I prayed to God about this and asked him to take it away .
He told me : » My grace is sufficient for you for my strength is made perfect in weakness . « Most gladly therefore , I would rather glory in my infirmities frailities , that the power of Christ may rest upon me cover me like a tent descend upon me abide with me .
Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities , in reproaches , in necessities , in persecutions , in distresses for Christ's sake : for when I am weak , then I am strong .
I have become a fool in boasting . You have compelled me : for I ought to have been commended about you : for in nothing am I inferior to the most prominent apostles , though I am nothing .
Truly the signs of an apostle were accomplished among you in all patience , in signs , and wonders , and mighty deeds .
What is it in which you were inferior to other congregations , except that I was not burdensome to you ? Forgive me this wrong .
Behold , the third time I am ready to come to you . I will not be burdensome to you : for I seek not yours , but you . The children should not provide for the parents , but the parents for the children .
I will gladly spend and be spent for you . When I love you more abundantly should I be loved less .
Just the same , I did not burden you : nevertheless , being crafty , I caught you by cunning .
Did I gain you by any of them whom I sent to you ?
I desired Titus , and with him I sent a brother . Did Titus gain you ? Did we not conduct ourselves in the same mental disposition ? Did we not walk in the same steps ?
Do you think that we excuse ourselves to you ? We speak before God in Christ : but we do all things , dearly beloved , for you ’ re up building .
I am afraid that I may come and find you different from what I want you to be , and that you may find me different from what you want me to be . I fear that there may be rivalry , jealousy , hot tempers , selfish ambition , slander , gossip , arrogance , and disorderly conduct .
I am afraid that the next time I come my God will humiliate me in your presence , and I shall weep over many who sinned in the past and have not repented of the uncleanness , fornication and loose conduct that they have practiced .
This is now the third time that I am coming to visit you . The testimony of two or three witnesses must uphold an accusation .
I told you in advance as if I were present the second time . Being absent now I write to those who have sinned and to all others . If I come again I will not spare you .
Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me , who is not weak toward you but is mighty in you .
Though he was impaled through weakness , yet he lives by the power of God . We are weak through him also , but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you .
Examine yourselves , whether you are in the faith . Prove your own selves . Do you not know this about yourselves that Jesus Christ is with you , unless you are disqualified ?
I trust that you will know that we are not disqualified .
Now I pray to God that you do no evil ; not that we should appear approved , but that you should do that which is honest , though we may seem disqualified .
We can do nothing against the truth , but for the truth .
We are glad , when we are weak , and you are strong . We also pray that you be readjusted .
Therefore I write these things being absent , lest being present I should use sharpness , according to the power that the Lord gave me to enlightenment and not to destruction .
Finally brothers , farewell : Be perfect , be of good comfort , be of one mind , live in peace ; and the God of love and peace will be with you .
Greet one another with a holy kiss .
All the holy ones salute you .
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ , and the love of God , and the intimate sharing of the Holy Spirit be with you all . Amen .
From Paul , who is an apostle not from men nor through men but through Jesus Christ , and God the Father , who raised him from the dead .
And from the brothers who are with me , to the congregations of Galatia :
Grace to you and peace from God our Father , and our Lord Jesus Christ .
He Jesus gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us out of this present evil age . This is according to the will of our God and Father .
To him is glory forever and ever . Amen .
I am amazed that you so quickly turned away from the One who called you by the grace of Christ . You turned to different good news .
Yet this is not another good news . But there are some who trouble agitate you , and they would pervert the good news of Christ .
If we , or an angel from heaven , should preach to you any message other than that which we preached to you , let him be accursed condemned expelled .
We said before and now I say again , if any man preaches to you any message other than what you received , let him be accursed !
Do I now seek the favor of men , or of God ? Am I striving to please men ? If I were still pleasing men , I would not be a servant of Christ .
For I make known to you brothers that the good news that was preached by me is not according to man .
I did not receive it from man . I was not taught it ! It came to me through revelation from Jesus Christ .
You heard about the way I lived as a Jew . How I persecuted the congregation of God beyond measure . In fact I tried to destroy it !
I advanced as a Jew beyond many of my own age among my countrymen . I was more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers .
It pleased God to separate me even from my mother’s womb and call me through his grace .
He revealed his Son to me that I might preach him among the nations . I do not confer with flesh and blood human beings .
I did not go to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before I was . I went away to Arabia and again I returned to Damascus .
Then after three years I went to Jerusalem to visit Cephas , and waited with him fifteen days .
But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord's brother .
What I write is true . God knows I do not lie .
Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia .
I was still unknown by face to the congregations of Judea that are in Christ .
They heard it said : » He that once persecuted us now preaches the faith he once tried to destroy . «
They glorified God because of me .
Fourteen years later I went again to Jerusalem with Barnabas . I took Titus with me also .
I went in response to a revelation . I demonstrated to them the way I spread the good news among the people of the nations . I did this privately before them for they have a reputation . I am concerned that by any means I should be running , or had run , in vain .
Titus was with me and he was not persuaded to be circumcised . He is a Greek .
This occurred because of the false brothers brought in secretly . They came to spy out our liberty that we have in Christ Jesus . This was so they might bring us into bondage .
We did not yield to them for a moment or an hour ! That way the truth of the good news the whole body of Christian teachings might continue with you .
Those who were recognized as important people did not add a single thing to my message . What sort of people they were makes no difference to me . God does not play favorites show partiality .
On the contrary , they saw that I had been entrusted with the good news to people who are not circumcised . Just as Peter had been entrusted with the good news to the people who are circumcised .
The one who made Peter an apostle to the Jewish people who are circumcised also made me an apostle to the people of the nations who are not circumcised .
When they saw the grace that was given to me , James , Cephas Peter and John , they who were known to be pillars , gave to Barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship . We were to go to the nations and they were to go to the people who are circumcised .
They wanted us to remember the poor . I was eager zealous to do this very thing .
When Cephas came to Antioch , I openly resisted him because he was completely wrong .
He ate with the people of the nations until some men James sent arrived . When they arrived , he drew back and separated himself . He feared those who were of the circumcised people .
The rest of the Jews were hypocrites with him , so much that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy .
I saw that they did not walk uprightly according to the truth of the good news . Therefore I said to Cephas , in front of them all : » If you , being a Jew , live as the nations do and not as the Jews , why do you compel the people of the nations to live like the Jews ? «
We are Jews by birth , and not sinners from the nations .
Yet we know that a man is not righteous by the works of the law , but through faith in Jesus Christ . We believed on Christ Jesus , that we might be righteous by faith in Christ , and not by the works of the law . The works of the law justify no one .
We sought to be righteous in Christ . And we were found to be sinners . Is Christ a minister of sin ? God forbid .
If I build up again the things that I destroyed , I prove myself a transgressor .
I , through the law , died to the law that I might live to for God .
I have been impaled with Christ . It is no longer I that live , but Christ lives in me . The life that I now live in the flesh physical body I live by faith . This is the faith that is in the Son of God . He loved me and gave himself up for me .
I do not reject the grace totally undeserved gift of God : for if righteousness is gained through the law , then Christ died for nothing .
O foolish Galatians , who fascinated cast a spell over beguiled influenced you ? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was openly presented impaled .
I want to learn this from you . Did you receive the Spirit by doing the works of the law , or by having faith in what you heard ?
Are you so foolish ? After starting in the Spirit , are you now made perfect mature in the flesh ?
Did you suffer so many things in vain ? Does it have no purpose ?
He that provides the Spirit , and works miracles among you , does he do it by the works of the Law , or by hearing with faith ?
Abraham believed God and » Jehovah considered his faith as his righteousness . «
You know that those who have faith are sons of Abraham .
The Scripture revealed ahead of time , that God justified the people of the nations by faith . He preached the good news beforehand to Abraham . He said : » In you will all the nations be blessed . «
So then those who have faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham .
Those who are of the works of the Law are under a curse . For it is written , » Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all things written in the book of the Law , by obeying them . «
The fact that the Law justifies no man before God is evident . The righteous will live by faith .
The Law is not based on faith . » He that does them will live by them . «
Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us . It is written ; » Cursed is everyone who is hung on a stake . «
This way the blessing of Abraham might come upon the nations through Christ Jesus and we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith .
Brothers , I speak like a man speaks : Though it is only a man's covenant , yet when it has been confirmed , no one makes it void , or adds to it .
The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed . He did not say to seeds , as of many ; but as of one , And to your seed , which is Christ .
Now this I say : the Law , which came four hundred and thirty years later , does not invalidate a covenant previously ratified by God , so as to nullify the promise .
If the inheritance is based on the Law , it is no longer based on a promise . However God granted it to Abraham by means of a promise .
What then is the law ? It was added to cause awareness of sin because of transgressions , till the seed should come to whom the promise has been made . It was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator .
A mediator is not a mediator of one ; but God is one .
Is the Law then against the promises of God ? God forbid ! If a law had been given which could impart life , righteousness would have been from the Law .
But the Scriptures shut up imprisoned pictured all things mankind under sin , that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe .
But before faith came the Law held us in custody . We were locked up until faith was revealed .
The Law was our schoolmaster Greek : paedagogue : a combination of schoolmaster , instructor , servant and guardian in charge of us to bring us to Christ , that we might be justified by faith .
Now that faith has come , we are no longer under a schoolmaster .
You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus .
For as many of you who were baptized into Christ put on clothed yourselves with Christ .
There is neither Jew nor Greek , there is neither slave nor free man , there is neither male nor female , for you are all one united in Christ Jesus .
If you are Christ's , then you are Abraham's seed , heirs according to promise .
But I say that so long as the heir is a child , he does not differ from a bondservant , though he is owner of the estate .
He is under guardians and stewards until the day set by the father .
When we were children , we too were held in bondage . We were slaves to the arrangement of this world .
When the full time came , God sent his Son , born of a woman , born under the law ,
that he might redeem those who were under the law , that we might receive the adoption as sons .
Because you are sons , God sent the spirit of his Son into our hearts , crying , Abba , Father .
So you are no longer slaves but a son . And as a son God has made you an heir .
However at that time , you did not know God . You were in bondage to things that are really not gods at all .
Now that you have come to know God , or rather to be known by God , how is it that you turn back again to the weak and poor fundamental things ? Do you want to slave for them all over again ?
You observe days and months , seasons and years .
I fear for you , that I have labored for you to no purpose and failed .
I beg you , brothers , become as I am , for I also used to be as you are . You did me no wrong .
You know that because of an infirmity of the flesh I preached the good news to you the first time .
That which was a temptation to you in my flesh , you did not despise or reject . You received me like an angel messenger of God , even like Christ Jesus .
Where then is your positive attitude ? I bear you witness , that , if possible , you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me .
So then have I become your enemy by telling you the truth ?
They zealously eagerly seek you in no good way . They desire to shut you out , that you may seek them .
It is good to be zealously sought in a good matter at all times , and not only when I am present with you .
My little children , of whom I am again in labor pains until Christ is formed in you
I wish to be present with you now , and to speak in a different way , for I am perplexed about you .
Tell me , you that desire to be under the Law ; do you not hear the Law ?
It is written , that Abraham had two sons , one by the slave woman , and one by the freewoman .
How is it that the son by the slave woman is born after the flesh ; but the son by the freewoman is born through promise ?
This contains an allegory symbolic drama . These women symbolize two covenants . One is from Mount Sinai , bearing children to bondage , which is Hagar .
Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia . She corresponds to the Jerusalem that now is . She is in bondage with her children .
The Jerusalem above is free . She is our mother .
It is written , » Rejoice , barren woman who does not give birth . Break forth and cry , you who do not labor ; for there are more children of the desolate than of the one who has the husband . «
Brothers , we are children who belong to the promise , the same as Isaac was .
Just like then , the son who was conceived in a natural way according to the flesh persecuted the son conceived in a spiritual way . That is exactly what is happening now !
What do the scriptures say ? » Throw out the slave woman and her son . For the son of the slave woman must not share the inheritance with the son of the free woman . «
Brothers , we are not children of a slave woman but of the free woman .
Christ liberated us for freedom moral liberty . Stand fast therefore , and do not become entangled again in a yoke of bondage .
Behold , I Paul say to you , that , if you receive circumcision , Christ will be of no benefit to you .
Yes , I testify again to every man who receives circumcision . He is under obligation to obey the whole Law .
You who seek to be righteous by Law are separated from Christ . You have fallen away from grace .
For we through the Spirit by faith wait for the hope of righteousness .
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision means anything , nor uncircumcision , but faith working through love .
You were running well ! Who hindered you that you should not obey the truth ?
This persuasion did not come from him who calls you .
A little leaven , leavens ferments the whole lump .
I have confidence in you in the Lord that you will adopt no other view . And he that troubles you will bear his judgment , who ever he is .
But I , brothers , if I still preach circumcision , why am I still persecuted ? Then has the stumbling block of the stake been done away ?
I would that they that unsettle you would even go beyond circumcision .
For you brothers , were called for freedom ; only do not use your freedom for an occasion to the flesh . Serve one another through love !
For the whole law is fulfilled in one word : You shall love your neighbor as yourself .
But if you continue to bite and devour one another , take care that you do not consume one another .
I say , walk by the Spirit , and you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh .
For the flesh lusts against the Spirit , and the Spirit against the flesh . These are in opposition to one another that you may not do the things that you would .
But if the Spirit leads you , you are not under the Law .
Now the works of the flesh sinful human nature are apparent . They are : fornication , uncleanness , loose conduct ,
idolatry , sorcery , enmities , strife , jealousy , wrath , contentions , divisions , sects ,
envies , drunkenness , revelries , and things like these . I forewarn you , even as I did forewarn you , that those who practice such things would not inherit the kingdom of God .
The fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , longsuffering , kindness , goodness , faith ,
meekness mildness , self-control ; against such there is no law .
Those who belong to Christ Jesus have impaled the flesh with its passions and lusts .
If we live by the Spirit , let us also walk by the Spirit .
Let us not become egotistical , stirring up competition with one another , envying one another .
Brothers , if someone is caught in any kind of wrongdoing , those of you who are spiritual should set him right . But you must do it in a gentle way . And keep an eye on yourselves , so that you will not be tempted , too .
Bear one another's burdens , and thereby fulfill the law of Christ .
So if any one of you thinks you are important when you really are not , you are only fooling yourself .
Each of you must examine your own actions . Then you can be proud of your own accomplishments without comparing yourself to others .
For each person should carry his own load .
But let him that is orally taught in the word share all good things .
Do not be deceived . God is not mocked ! A man will harvest what he sows .
He that sows to his own flesh will harvest corruption of the flesh . But he that sows to the Spirit will harvest everlasting life from the Spirit .
Let us not grow tired of doing good things for in due season we shall harvest , if we do not faint .
So then , as we have opportunity , let us work that which is good toward all men , and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith .
See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand .
Those who desire to make a showing in the flesh try to compel you to be circumcised . This is done so they may not be persecuted for the stake of Christ .
For not even those who receive circumcision obey the Law . They desire to have you circumcised , that they may boast in your flesh .
Never should I boast except in the stake symbolic : self-denial and atonement of our Lord Jesus Christ . It is through this stake that the world has been impaled to me , and I to the world .
For neither is circumcision anything , nor uncircumcision anything , but a new creature is .
The Israel of God will have peace and mercy . All who walk by this rule will also .
Let no one trouble me . I bear the marks of Jesus branded on my body .
The grace Greek : charis , divine favor , loving-kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit Greek : pneuma , mental outlook , attitude , brothers . Amen .
Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God , to the holy ones who are at Ephesus and the faithful in Christ Jesus :
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . He has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places through Christ .
He chose us through him before the foundation of the world , that we should be holy and without blemish before him in love .
He predetermined ordained us to adoption , as sons to himself through Jesus Christ , according to the kind intention of his will .
This is to the praise of the glory of his kindness , with which he freely honored us , the loved ones .
In him we have our redemption through his blood , the forgiveness of our trespasses , according to the riches of his grace .
He made this undeserved kindness abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence insight .
He made known to us the secret of his will , according to his good pleasure and purpose .
It was for an administration at the appointed time . This administration is to gather up all things in Christ , the things in heaven , and the things upon the earth . Yes in him !
We were assigned as heirs predetermined according to his purpose . He works all things according to his direction and will .
We who were first to hope in Christ should serve to the praise of his glory .
You have heard the word of the truth in Christ . It is the good news about your salvation . You also believed and were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit .
The Holy Spirit is a guarantee that we will receive our inheritance . This assures us that God will set us free to the praise of his glory .
For this cause I also , having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus that is among you , and the love you show all the holy ones .
I continually give thanks for you in my prayers .
May the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory , give you a spirit mental disposition of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him .
Have the eyes of your heart enlightened , that you may know the hope of his calling , the riches of his glorious inheritance in the holy ones ,
and what the exceeding greatness of his power is toward us who believe , according to the operation of his mighty strength .
He operated in Christ , when he raised him from the dead , and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places .
It is far above all governments and authority , power and dominion , and every name that is named , not only in this age but also in that which is to come .
He God put all things in subjection under his feet , and made him head over all things to the congregation ,
which is his body , the fullness of him who fills accomplishes completes all in all .
You were once dead because of your trespasses and sins .
You once walked according to the course of this world , according to the ruler of the power authority and jurisdiction of the air , the spirit that is now active in the sons of disobedience .
We all once lived in the lust of our flesh , indulging the desires lusts of the flesh and of the mind . We were by nature children of anger and violent passion , like everyone else .
But God , being rich in mercy , because of his great love with which he loved us ,
even when we were dead in our trespasses , made us alive together with Christ . For by grace loving-kindness you have been saved .
God raised us up with him and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places , with Christ Jesus .
So in the ages to come he , with Christ Jesus , might show the exceeding surpassing exceptional riches of his grace with kindness toward us .
By grace Greek : charis , divine favor , loving-kindness you have been saved through faith . It is not from you . It is the gift from God !
It is not the result of works . So no man should boast .
For we are his workmanship created with Christ Jesus for good works . God prepared these works in advance that we should walk in them .
Remember that you were once people of the nations in the flesh . You are called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision , in the flesh , made by human hands .
You were separate from Christ at that time , alienated from the commonwealth of Israel . You were strangers from the covenants of the promise . You had no hope and were without God in the world .
You were once far off but now with Christ Jesus , the blood of Christ has brought you near .
For he is our peace , who made both Jews and Gentiles one , and broke down the middle barrier of partition .
Christ abolished in his flesh the enmity ill will , which the law of commandments contained in ordinances . That way he might create one new man , out of the two , with himself establishing peace .
So he reconciled them both in one body to God through the stake . He put to death the enmity antagonism hostility .
He came and preached peace to you who were far off , and peace to those who were near .
We both have access to the Father by one Spirit through him .
So then you are no longer strangers and aliens . You are fellow citizens with the holy ones and of the household of God .
You are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets . Christ Jesus is the chief corner stone .
In him each building fits together and grows into a » holy Temple for Jehovah . «
In Christ you are assembled together as a place for God’s Spirit to dwell .
For this cause I , Paul , am the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you people of the nations .
You have heard of the stewardship of God’s loving kindness that was given to me with you in view .
The secret was made known to me by revelation , just as I wrote before in few words .
When you read this you can understand my insight into the secret of Christ .
It was not made known to other generations of the sons of men , as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit .
The Gentiles are fellow-heirs , and fellow-members of the body , and fellow-partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the good news .
I was made a minister , according to the gift of God’s grace that was given me according to the working of his power .
To me , the very least of all the holy ones , was given grace loving divine influence to preach to the people of the nations the untraceable riches of Christ .
To make all men see what is the administration of the secret which for ages has been hidden in God who created all things .
It is the intent that now the manifold wisdom of God might be made known through the congregation and the rules and authorities in the heavenly places .
This is according to the eternal purpose determination design arrangement that He carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord .
We have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him .
So I ask you not to lose heart at my tribulations for you , for they are your glory .
For this cause I bow my knees to the Father .
Every family in heaven and on earth obtains its name from him .
That he would grant you , according to the riches of his glory , that you may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man .
May Christ dwell in your hearts through faith to the end that you will be rooted and grounded in love .
May you be able to comprehend with all the holy ones the breadth and length and height and depth .
And may you know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge . May you be filled with all the fullness of God .
Now to him that is able to do far more abundantly above all that we ask or think , according to the power that works in us .
Glory be to him in the congregation and in Christ Jesus to all generations , forever and ever . Amen .
I therefore , the prisoner in the Lord , invite you to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called .
Walk with all lowliness and meekness , with longsuffering , putting up with one another in love .
Diligently try to keep the unity oneness of the Spirit in the bond of peace .
There is one body , and one Spirit , even as you also were called in one hope of your calling .
There is one Lord , one faith , and one baptism .
There is one God and Father of all , who is over all , and through all , and in all .
But unto each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ .
Therefore it says : » When he ascended on high , he led captives , and gave gifts to men anthropos : human beings . «
Now this , He ascended , what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth ?
He that descended is the same also that ascended far above all the heavens , that he might fill all things .
He gave some to be apostles ; and some , prophets ; and some , evangelists ; and some , shepherds and teachers .
This is for the perfecting equipping preparing of the holy ones , for the work of ministering , for the building up of the body of Christ :
until we all attain to the unity of the faith , and of the knowledge of the Son of God , to a full-grown mature man , to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ .
We must no longer be children , tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine , by the trickery of men , in craftiness , after the wiles of error .
By speaking the truth in love , we must grow up in all things to him . For he , Christ , is the head .
The entire body is properly framed and fitted together through that which every joint supplies , according to the working in due measure of each individual part . It makes the body increase by building itself in love .
This I say therefore , and testify affirm in the Lord , that you no longer walk as the nations also walk , in the vanity futility depravity of their mind thinking .
They are darkened blinded obscured in their understanding , alienated from the life of God , because of the ignorance that is in them , because of the hardening of their heart .
They are past feeling . They have given themselves over to loose conduct , to work all uncleanness with greediness a lust for more .
But you did not learn Christ that way .
You learned him and were taught by him just as truth is in Jesus .
You put away your former way course behavior conversation of life , the old self that was corrupt with the lusts of deceit .
You are renewed in the spirit vital principles attitude of your mind understanding .
Put on the new man , that in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth .
Put away falsehood . Speak truth each one of you with his neighbor : for we are members belonging to together with of one another .
Be angry and do not sin . Do not let the sun go down upon your anger rage .
Do not give the devil an opportunity .
He that steals must steal no more . Let him labor , working with his hands the thing that is good , that he may have something to give to someone in need .
Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth . Speak what is good for understanding as the need may be , that it may give grace divine favor to those who hear .
Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God , in which Greek : en hos in which Greek : hos , he ho whereby which you were sealed to the day of release by ransom .
Let all bitterness , and wrath , and anger , and screaming , and abusive speech , be put away removed expiated from you , along with all malice .
You should be kind to one another , tenderhearted , forgiving each other , even as God also forgave you through by means of Christ .
Therefore imitate God like beloved children .
Walk in love , even as Christ also loved you , and gave himself up for us . He was an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling odor .
Fornication , and all uncleanness , or covetousness , must not even be mentioned among you , as is proper among holy ones .
Nor should there be filthiness , nor foolish talking , or jesting , which are not befitting but rather giving of thanks .
For you know this with certainty , that no fornicator , no unclean person , no covetous man , who is an idolater , has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God .
Let no one deceive you with empty words . It is because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience .
Do not be partakers with them .
You were once darkness , but now you are light in the Lord . Walk live be occupied as children of light
for the fruit of the light life spirit consists of all goodness and righteousness and truth .
Learn what is well pleasing to the Lord .
Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness , but instead reprove expose convict them .
For the things that are done by them in secret is a shame even to speak about .
But all things become visible when the light exposes them , for everything that becomes visible is light .
For this reason it says : » Awake , sleeper , and arise from the dead , and Christ will shine on you . «
Be careful how you walk , not as unwise men but as wise .
Make the most of your time redeem or ransom back time , because the days are evil .
Do not be foolish , but understand perceive what the will of Jehovah is .
Do not get drunk with wine , for that is a public act of violence , but be filled with the Spirit .
Speak to one another in psalms and praise and spiritual songs , singing and making melody with your heart to Jehovah .
Always give thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God , even the Father .
Be subject obedient subordinate to one another in reverence of Christ .
Wives , be subject to your own husbands , as to the Lord .
For the husband is the head of the wife , and Christ also is the head of the congregation , he being the savior of the body .
The congregation is subject to Christ . Likewise let the wives also be to their husbands in everything .
Husbands love your wives , even as Christ also loved the congregation and gave himself up for it .
This is so he might sanctify it , having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word .
So he will be able to present the congregation to himself as a glorious congregation , not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing . It should be holy and without blemish .
In this way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies . He that loves his own wife loves himself .
No man ever hated his own flesh ; but nourishes and cherishes it , even as Christ also does the congregation .
And we are members of his body !
For this reason a man will leave his father and mother , and will stick adhere cleave be joined to his wife . The two will become one flesh .
This secret is great ! I speak with regard to Christ and of the congregation .
Each one of you should love his own wife even as himself . The wife should respect her husband .
Children , obey your parents in the Lord for this is right .
Honor your father and mother , which is the first commandment with promise .
Then it will go well with you , and you may live long on the earth .
Fathers , do not provoke your children to anger but nurture them in the discipline and instruction of God .
Servants , be obedient to those who according to the flesh are your masters , with fear and trembling , in sincerity of your heart , as to Christ .
This should not be in the way of eye service , as men-pleasers ; but as servants of Christ , doing the will of God from a complete heart ;
with goodwill doing service , as to God , and not to men .
You know that whatever good thing each person does , the same shall he receive again from God , whether he be slave or free .
You masters , do the same things to them . Do not threaten ! You know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven . There is no favoritism with him .
Finally , be strong in the Lord , and in his mighty strength .
Put on the full armor every implement of God , that you may be able to stand against the cunning inventive clever methods of the devil .
Our struggle is not against flesh and blood , but against the rulers , against the powers , against the world forces of this darkness , against the spiritual forces of wickedness in heavenly places .
For that reason , take up the full armor of God , so that you will be able to resist in the evil day , having done everything , to stand firm .
Stand firm therefore and gird your loins with truth . Put on the breastplate of righteousness .
Shod your feet with the preparation of the good news of peace .
Also take up the shield of faith , with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one .
Take the helmet of salvation , and the sword of the Spirit , which is the word of God .
With prayer and supplication pray at all times in the Spirit . Watch with all perseverance and supplication for all the holy ones .
Pray on my behalf , that ability to speak may be given to me , to make known with boldness the secret of the good news .
I am an ambassador in chains who should speak boldly .
That you also may know my affairs , how I do , Tychicus , the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord , will make known to you all things .
I have sent him to you for this very purpose , that you may know our state , and that he may comfort your hearts .
Peace be to the brothers , and love with faith , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
Grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an incorruptible sincere principled unending love .
Paul and Timothy , servants of Christ Jesus , to all the holy ones in union with Christ Jesus who are at Philippi , with the overseers and ministerial servants :
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
I thank my God for all my memories of you .
I always offer prayer filled with joy for you ,
and for your fellowship in participation of the good news from the first day until now .
I am confident of this very thing , that he who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ .
It is right for me to feel this way on behalf of you all , because I have you in my heart . Both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the good news you are all partakers with me of grace .
God is my witness , how I long for you all in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus .
I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment .
This way you may approve test the things that are excellent of more value . May you be sincere and without offense blameless to others till the day of Christ .
Be filled with the fruits of righteousness through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God .
I would have you know , brothers that the things that happened to me turned out for the greater progress of the good news .
My imprisonment in Christ became known throughout the whole Praetorian Guard , and to all brothers .
Most of the brothers trust in the Lord and boldly speak the word of God without fear because of my bonds .
Some preach Christ from envy and strife and some from good will .
The latter ones do it out of love , knowing that I am set appointed placed here for the defense of the good news .
But the others proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition without pure motives , thinking to cause me great suffering and distress in my imprisonment .
What then ? That in every way , whether in pretence or in truth , Christ is proclaimed ! For that I rejoice . Yes , and I will rejoice !
For I know that this will turn out to my redemption through your prayer and the provision of the spirit vital principles mind of Jesus Christ .
I will not be put to shame according to my earnest expectation and hope . With all boldness , as always , so now also Christ shall be magnified in me , whether by life or by death .
For to me to live is Christ , and to die is gain .
If I live in the flesh this will bring fruit from my labor . I do not know what to choose .
I am hard pressed between the two . I have the desire to depart and be with Christ for it is far better .
Yet to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sake .
Having this confidence , I know that I will remain . Yes , I will remain with you all for your progress and joy in the faith .
Let your rejoicing abound in Christ Jesus through my presence with you again .
Let your manner of life be worthy of the good news about Christ . Whether I come and see you or am absent , I may hear of your conduct , that you stand fast in one spirit common purpose mental disposition vital principle , with one mind striving together for the faith of the good news .
Do not be frightened by opponents . This is evidence of destruction for them and salvation for you from God .
It has been granted to you in behalf of Christ . Not only to believe on him , but also to suffer in his behalf .
You have the same conflict that you saw in me , and now hear to be in me .
If there is any consolation in Christ , if any comfort of love , if any fellowship of the Spirit , if any tender affection tender mercy and compassions ,
make my joy full by being of the same mind , having the same love , being of one accord , and of one purpose .
Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit , but in humility consider others more important than you .
Look out for the interest of others and not only for your own personal interest .
Have this attitude mind-set understanding mental state in you that was also in Christ Jesus .
He existed in the form shape and nature of God but did not try to be equal with God . He did not even consider it !
He emptied humbled himself by taking the form of a servant . He was made in the likeness of men .
He obtained the appearance as a man , humbled himself , and became obedient even to death , yes , death on the stake .
For this reason God highly exalted him , and gave to him the name that is above every name , Relative authority given by Jehovah God , the Father to His Son
that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow , of things in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth ,
and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord , to the glory of God the Father .
My beloved , you have always obeyed , not just in my presence , but now much more in my absence . Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling .
It is God who works in you both to will and to work , for his good pleasure .
Do all things without complaining grumbling murmuring and questioning disputing .
That way you may become blameless and harmless , children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation . You are seen as lights in the world .
Hold fast to the word of life so I may rejoice in the day of Christ . That way I will not have labored in vain .
If I am offered for the sacrifice and service of your faith , I rejoice with you all .
You should also rejoice in the same manner .
I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly that I may be encouraged when I know your circumstances .
For I have no man likeminded , who will truly care for you .
They all seek their own interest and not the things of Jesus Christ .
But you know of his proven worth . It was like a son with his father that he served with me to further the good news .
I hope to send him as soon as I see how it goes with me .
I trust in the Lord that I also will come shortly .
I find it necessary to send Epaphroditus to you . He is my brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier , and your messenger and minister to my need .
He longed to see you and was worried because you had heard that he was sick .
Indeed he was sick and near to death . But God had mercy on him ; and not on him only , but also on me , that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow .
I have sent him quickly , that , when you see him again , you may rejoice , and that I may be the less sorrowful .
Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy . Hold such in honor
because for the work of Christ he came near to death , risking his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me .
Finally my brothers , rejoice in the Lord . To write the same things to you , to me indeed is not a bother , but for you it is a safeguard .
Beware of the dogs impure men false teachers ! Beware of the evil workers ! Beware of the mutilation of the body .
We are those with true circumcision who worship by the Spirit of God . We glory in Christ Jesus , and put no confidence in the flesh .
I might have confidence even in the flesh . If any other man thinks to have confidence in the flesh , I have more !
I was circumcised the eighth day , of the stock of Israel , of the tribe of Benjamin , a Hebrew of Hebrews ; as touching the law , a Pharisee ;
as touching zeal , persecuting the church ; as touching the righteousness which is in the law , found blameless .
Things that offered gain to me I count a loss for Christ .
I count all things to be loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord . I suffered the loss of all things . Yet I count them as refuse garbage dung that I may gain Christ .
I want to be united with him . I no longer want a righteousness of my own that is gained by obeying the law . The righteousness from God is by faith in Christ .
I want to know him and the power of his resurrection . I want to know the fellowship of his sufferings and become conformed to his death .
I wish to attain to the resurrection from the dead .
Not that I have already obtained , or am already made perfect . But I press on , that I may obtain that for which Christ Jesus also obtained .
Brothers , I could not yet have obtained it . But one thing I do , I forget the things that are behind , and stretch forward to the things that are ahead .
I press on toward the goal to the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus .
Let those of us who are mature have this attitude . If you have a different attitude God will show you how to think .
However , we should be guided by what we have learned so far .
Brothers , be imitators of me . Pay attention to those who live by the example we have given you .
Many live as enemies of the stake of Christ . I often wept as I told you about them .
Their end is destruction . Their god is their belly . Their glory is in their shame . They set their mind on earthly things .
However , our citizenship is in heaven . We also eagerly wait for the Savior , the Lord Jesus Christ .
Christ will , through his power , bring everything under his authority . He will change our humble bodies and make them like his glorified glorious body literally and figuratively : body of his glory . He is able to subject all things to himself .
Therefore , my beloved brothers I long to see you . You are my joy and crown . In this way stand firm in the Lord , my beloved .
I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to live in harmony in the Lord .
Indeed , true companion , I ask you also to help these women who have shared my struggle in the cause of the good news , together with Clement also and the rest of my fellow workers , whose names are in the Book of Life .
Rejoice in the Lord always ; again I say , rejoice !
Let your gentleness mildness moderation be known to all men for the Lord is near .
Be anxious for nothing , but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God .
The peace of God , which surpasses all understanding , will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus .
Finally , brothers , whatever things are true , whatever things are honorable , whatever things are just , whatever things are pure , whatever things are lovely , whatever things are of good report ; if there is any virtue , and if there is any praise , think about these things .
The things that you have learned , received , heard and saw in me ; do these things and the God of peace will be with you .
I rejoice in the Lord greatly , that now at length you have revived your thought for me . You did indeed take thought , but you lacked opportunity .
I am not saying this because I am in need ; for I have learned to be content in whatever state I am .
I know how to be poor . I also know how to live with abundance . In everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry , both to have abundance and to suffer need .
I can do all things through him who strengthens me .
You did well that you share with me in my affliction .
You also know , you Philippians , that in the beginning of the good news , when I departed from Macedonia , no other congregation shared their money with me . Only you shared with me .
While I was in Thessalonica you provided for my needs twice .
Not that I seek the gift but I seek the fruit that adds to your account .
I have all things , and prosper : I am filled , having received from Epaphroditus the things that came from you . It is an odor of a sweet smell , a sacrifice acceptable , well pleasing to God .
My God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus .
Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever . Amen .
Greet every holy one in Christ Jesus . The brothers who are with me greet you .
All the holy ones greet you , especially they who are of Caesar's household .
The grace Greek : charis : divine influence of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit Greek : pneuma : mental disposition .
Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God , and Timothy our brother ,
to the holy ones and faithful brothers in Christ that live in Colossae : Grace to you and peace from God our Father .
We always pray for you , and thank God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ for you .
We have heard about your faith in Christ Jesus , and of the love you have for all the holy ones .
This is because of the hope reserved for you in heaven . You heard about this hope from the word of truth , the good news .
It came to you even as it did . Everywhere in the entire world it bears fruit and it increases in you also , since the day you heard and knew the grace loving-kindness of God in truth .
You learned about Epaphras , our beloved fellow servant , who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf .
He also declared your love to us in the Spirit .
Since the day we heard about you , we have not ceased to pray and make request for you . We pray for you to be filled with the intimate accurate knowledge discernment recognition of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding .
Walk worthily of God , fully pleasing him . Bear fruit in every good work , and increase in the knowledge Greek : epignosis : full discernment , recognition of God .
God will strengthen you with all power , according to the might of his glory , to all patience and longsuffering with joy .
Give thanks to the Father , who made us partakers of the inheritance of the holy ones in the light .
He rescued us from the power of darkness , and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of his love the Son he dearly loves .
We have in him our redemption and the forgiveness of our sins .
He is the image likeness representation of the invisible God . He is the firstborn Greek : prototokos : childbirth , offspring of all creation .
All things in the heavens and upon the earth where created through him . The things visible and invisible were created through him . Whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers ; all things have been created through him , and for him .
He is before all things , and through him all things originate .
He is the head of the body , the congregation . He is the beginning commencement , the firstborn from the dead ; that in all things he might have the preeminence first place .
It was the good pleasure of the Father that in him all the fullness should dwell .
And all things are reconciled through him . He made peace through the blood of his atonement of the stake . He reconciles all things , whether things upon the earth , or things in heaven .
You were in the past alienated and enemies because your minds were on your evil works .
But he Christ reconciled you in the body of his flesh through death , to present you holy and without blemish and without accusation before Him God .
Provided that you continue in the faith , grounded on the foundation and steadfast , and not moved away from the hope of the good news you heard , which was preached in all creation under heaven . For this I , Paul , was made a minister .
I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake . I do my share in behalf of his body , the congregation , to provide what is lacking of the afflictions of Christ .
God gave me this stewardship to perform for your good . He has made me a servant of the congregation . It is for the task of fully proclaiming the word of God .
It is the secret he hid through all past ages from all human beings but has now revealed to his holy ones .
It was God’s will to make known his secret to the people of the nations , this rich and glorious secret that he has for people . The secret is that Christ is in union with you , which means that you will share in his glory .
We preach Christ to everyone . With all possible wisdom we warn and teach them in order to bring each one to God as a mature individual in union with Christ .
I work hard to get this done . I use the mighty strength Christ supplies . It is at work in me .
Let me tell you how hard I worked for you , for the people in Laodicea , and for all others who do not personally know me .
I do this that they may be filled with courage and be united knit together in love . I have the full assurance that only true understanding brings . In this way they will accurately know God’s secret , which is Christ himself .
In him is concealed all the hidden treasures of God’s wisdom and knowledge .
I tell you this : Do not let anyone deceive you with false arguments , no matter how good they seem to be .
Even though I am absent in body , yet I am with you in spirit mental disposition . I am glad when I see the resolute firmness with which you stand together in your faith in Christ .
You have accepted Christ Jesus as Lord . Now walk live in union with him .
Keep your roots deep in him ! Build your lives on him . Become stronger in your faith , as you were taught , and be filled with thanksgiving .
See to it that no one enslaves you by means of philosophy and worthless deceit of human wisdom according to tradition of men . It is according to the elementary principles of the world , and not from Christ .
The fullness of divine nature lives in Christ’s bodily form . Greek : theotes : essence and nature of God Only the Son of God could have divine attributes , the inherited qualities from the Father
You are made full complete perfect mature in him . He is the head over all government and authority .
You were also circumcised in him with a circumcision not made with hands , in the putting off of the body of the flesh , in the circumcision of Christ .
You have been buried with him in baptism . You were also raised with him through faith in the working of God , who raised him from the dead .
You were dead through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh . He made you alive together with him , having forgiven us all our trespasses .
He blotted out the bond written in ordinances . It was against us and was contrary to us . He has taken it out of the way . He nailed it to the stake .
He disarmed the rulers and authorities ! He made a public display of them triumphing over them .
Let no man judge you in food or in drink or in respect of a feast day or a new moon or a Sabbath day .
They are a shadow of the things to come ; but the substance belongs to Christ .
Let no man rob you of your prize by a self-abasement and worshipping of the angels , dwelling in the things that he has seen , vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind ,
not holding fast to the head , from whom all the body , being supplied and knit together through the joints and bands , grows with the growth from God .
If you died with Christ from the rudiments of the world , why , as though living in the world , do you subject yourselves to ordinances :
» Do not handle . Do not taste . Do not touch . «
These are the precepts and doctrines of men .
These have , indeed , the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body . But these are not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh .
If you have been raised together with Christ , seek the things above , where Christ is , seated at the right hand of God .
Think about the things that are above , not on the things that are upon the earth .
For you died and your life is hidden with Christ in God .
When Christ , who is our life , will be made known , then you will also be made known with him in glory .
Make your members that are upon the earth dead with regard to fornication , uncleanness , passion , evil desire , and covetousness greed , which is idolatry .
Because of such things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience .
You once walked in these when you lived in them .
Now you also put them all away : anger , wrath , malice , slander , and abusive speech out of your mouth .
Do not lie to one another , seeing that you got rid of the old self with its evil practices .
You put on the new self that is being renewed to a true knowledge full discernment according to the image of the one who created him .
There is no distinction between Greek and Jew , circumcision and uncircumcision , barbarian , Scythian , bondman , freeman ; but Christ is all and in all .
As God’s chosen , holy and beloved , put on a heart of compassion , kindness , lowliness humility , meekness mildness , and long-suffering patience .
Tolerate endure suffer put up with one another , and forgive each other . If any man has a complaint against anyone , forgive them , even as God forgave you .
Above all these things , put on love , which is the bond of perfection and unity .
Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts . You were called in one body for this purpose . You be thankful .
Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you with all wisdom . Teach and admonish one another with psalms , praises to God , and spiritual songs . Sing with gratitude in your hearts to God .
Whatever you do in word or deed , do all in the name of the Lord Jesus . Give thanks to God the Father through him .
Wives , be in subjection to your husbands , as is fitting in the Lord .
Husbands , love your wives , and do not be harsh with them .
Children , obey your parents in all things , for this is well pleasing in the Lord .
Fathers , do not provoke your children , that they not be discouraged .
Servants , obey your masters according to the flesh in all things , not with eye-service , as men-pleasers , but in singleness of heart , respecting God .
Whatever you do , work at it without reservation , as to God , and not to men .
You know that God will give you the reward of the inheritance when you serve the Master , Christ .
For he who does wrong will receive the consequences of the wrong that he has done . There is no partiality .
Masters , give your servants that which is just and equal . You know that you also have a Master in heaven .
Continue steadfastly in prayer , being vigilant with thanksgiving .
Pray also for us that God may open to us a door for the word , to speak the secret of Christ , for which I have also been imprisoned .
Let me make it known , as I ought to speak .
Behave with wisdom toward those who are outside , making the most of the time .
Let your speech be always with grace , seasoned with salt , that you may know how you ought to answer each one .
Tychicus will make known all my affairs to you , the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord .
I have sent him to you for this very purpose , that you may know our situation , and that he may comfort your hearts .
He will be with Onesimus , the faithful and beloved brother , who is one of you . They will make known to you all things that are done here .
Aristarchus my fellow-prisoner greets you , and Mark , the cousin of Barnabas about whom you received instructions ; if he comes to you , receive him ,
and Jesus that is called Justus , who are of the circumcision : these only are my fellow-workers for the kingdom of God , men that have been comfort encouragement consolation to me .
Epaphras , who is one of you , a servant of Christ Jesus , greets you , always striving for you in his prayers , that you may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God .
I testify for him , that he has worked hard for you , and for them in Laodicea , and for them in Hierapolis .
Luke , the beloved physician , and Demas greet you .
Greet the brothers who are in Laodicea , and Nympha , and the congregation that is in her house .
When this letter has been read among you , make sure it is read also in the congregation of the Laodiceans ; and that you also read the letter from Laodicea .
Say to Archippus , » Take heed to the ministry you received in the Lord , that you fulfill it . «
I , Paul , write this greeting with my own hand . Remember my imprisonment . Grace be with you .
Paul , Silvanus , and Timothy , to the congregation of the Thessalonians united with God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ : Grace to you and peace .
We give thanks to God always for you all , making mention of you in our prayers .
We continually remember your work of faith , labor of love , and patience , and your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ , before our God and Father .
We know your calling brothers , beloved of God .
We preached the good news to you , not in words only but with power from Holy Spirit and with conviction of its truth . You know how we lived when we were with you . It was for your own good .
You imitated the Lord and us , even though you suffered much affliction . Yet you received the word with the joy that comes from the Holy Spirit .
So you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia .
For not only did the message about God go out from you throughout Macedonia and Achaia , but the news about your faith in God has gone everywhere . There is nothing that we need to say .
All those people speak about how you received us when we visited you , and how you turned away from idols to God , to serve the true and living God ,
and to wait for his Son to come from heaven , his Son Jesus , whom he raised from death and who rescues us from God’s anger indignation that is to come .
For you know brothers that our coming to you was not in vein .
After we suffered and were mistreated in Philippi , we had the boldness confidence in our God to speak the good news of God to you amid much opposition .
For our presentation exhortation is not based on error , or of uncleanness , or in deceit .
We always speak , as God wants us to . He has judged us worthy to be entrusted with the Good News . We do not try to please people , but to please God , who tests our motives examines our hearts .
You know very well that we did not come to you with flattering talk praise for selfish gain . We did not use words to cover up greed insatiable desire for wealth . God is our witness !
We did not try to get praise from anyone , either from you or from others , even though as apostles of Christ we could have made demands on you .
But we were gentle when we were with you , like a mother taking care of her children .
Having much affection for you , we were well pleased to impart the good news of God to you and also to share our lives with you . You have become very dear to us .
You may remember , brothers , our labor and hardship . We worked day and night that we would not burden any of you when we preached the good news of God to you .
You and God are witnesses , how devoutly and righteously , without blame , we behaved toward you who believe !
You know how we dealt with each one of you . It was like a father with his own children , exhorting you , and encouraging and showing you .
You should walk worthily of God , who called you into his own kingdom and glory .
For this purpose we also thank God without ceasing , that , when you received from us the word of the message , even the word of God , you accepted it , not as the word of men , but , as it is in truth , the word of God , which also works in you who believe .
You brothers became imitators of the congregations of God that are in Judea in Christ Jesus . You also suffered the same things from your own countrymen as they did from the Jews .
They killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets , and drove us out . They did not please God and are contrary to all men .
They hindered us from speaking to the nations so that they may be saved . The result was that they always fill up the measure of their sins . But wrath has come upon them to the utmost .
But we have been taken away from you for a short while . We have been taken away in person , not in spirit . We are all the more eager with great desire to see you .
We wanted to come to you . I , Paul , wanted to more than once and yet Satan hindered us .
Who is our hope , or joy , or crown of exultation ? Is it not you , in the presence of our Lord Jesus , at his coming ?
For you are our glory and joy !
When we could endure it no longer , we thought it best to be left behind at Athens .
So we sent Timothy , our brother and God’s fellow worker in the good news of Christ . He came to strengthen and encourage you concerning your faith .
We do not want anyone to be discouraged by these troubles . You know we were bound to suffer persecution .
When we were with you , we told you that we would suffer tribulation and affliction . It happened , as you know .
For this cause , when I could no longer bear it , I inquired about your faith . I feared that the tempter might have tempted you , and our labor would be in vain .
Timothy came from you to us , and brought us good news about your faith and love . We want you to have good memories of us always , and that you desire to see us just as we also desire to see you .
Brothers , your faith has comforted us . In all our trouble and suffering we are encouraged .
Now we live , if you persevere stand fast in the Lord .
What thanks can we render to God for you and for all the joy we have for your sakes before our God ?
Night and day we pray exceedingly that we might see you in person , and might perfect restore repair that which is lacking in your faith .
May God our Father , and our Lord Jesus Christ , direct our way to you .
And may the Lord make you increase and abound in love one toward another , and toward all men , even as we do toward you .
May he resolutely strengthen your hearts without blame in holiness before God , our Father , at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his holy ones .
Furthermore , we encourage you , brothers , and exhort you by the Lord Jesus , that as you have received from us how you ought to walk , and to please God , so you would abound more and more .
You know the commandments we gave you through the Lord Jesus .
This is the will of God , for your sanctification holiness purification , that you should abstain from fornication .
Every one of you should know how to possess his own vessel in holiness and honor ,
not in the lust of sexual desire like the nations who do not know God .
Let no man defraud his brother in any matter . Jehovah is the avenger of this . We also have warned you and testified .
For God has not called us to uncleanness , but to holiness .
He therefore that rejects this , rejects not man , but God , who has also given his Holy Spirit to us .
I do not need to write you about brotherly love . For God taught you to love one another .
Indeed , you do it toward all the brothers in all Macedonia : but we encourage you to increase more and more .
Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life , and mind your own business , and work with your hands , as we command you .
That way you may walk honestly in the eyes of those on the outside and lack nothing .
I do not want you to be ignorant brothers , concerning those who are asleep in death . You do not need to sorrow like others who have no hope .
If we believe that Jesus died and rose again , God will bring with him those who sleep in Jesus .
We tell you this by God’s Word , that we who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not precede those who are asleep .
For the Lord will descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of the archangel , and with the trumpet of God : and the dead in Christ will rise first .
We that are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air ; and so will we ever be with the Lord .
Comfort one another with these words .
You have no need that I write to you about the times and dates , brothers .
For you know perfectly that the » Day of Jehovah « will come like a thief in the night .
When they say , » Peace and security ! « then sudden destruction will come upon them , as labor pains come to a pregnant woman . They will not escape .
You do not live in the dark . That day should not overtake you by surprise as a thief would .
You are all the children sons of light , and the children of the day . We are not of the night , not of darkness .
Therefore , let us not sleep like others do . But let us watch and be sober .
They that sleep do so in the night . They that get drunk are drunk in the night .
Let us be sober and put on the breastplate of faith and love ; and the hope of salvation as a helmet .
For God has not appointed us to experience his wrath , but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ .
He died for us , that , whether we are awake in this life or sleep in death , we should live together with him .
Comfort each other and strengthen one another as you are doing .
We ask you , brothers , to appreciate those who labor among you , and are over you in the Lord , and admonish you .
To esteem them very highly in love because of the work they do . And be at peace among yourselves .
We ask you brothers to warn the unruly and comfort the fainthearted , support the weak , be patient with all men .
See that no one renders evil for evil to anyone . But follow that which is good , both among you , and to all men .
Rejoice always .
Pray without ceasing .
In everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you .
Do not quench the Spirit .
Do not despise prophesying .
Prove all things ; hold fast to what is good .
Abstain from all appearance of evil .
May the very God of peace completely sanctify you make you holy . I pray to God that your entire spiritual being , your mind and body , is preserved blameless until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ .
Faithful is he who calls you . He will also make it happen .
Brothers , pray for us .
Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss .
I charge you by the Lord that this letter is to be read to all the brothers .
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you . Amen .
Paul , Silvanus , and Timothy to the people of the congregation in Thessalonica , who belong to God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ :
May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace .
Our friends , we should thank God at all times for you . It is right for us to do so , because your faith is growing so much and the love each of you has for the other abounds toward each other .
That is why we boast rejoice have glory about you in the congregations of God . We boast rejoice have glory about the way you continue to endure and believe through all the persecutions and sufferings you experience .
All of this proves that God’s judgment is just , and as a result , you will become worthy of his Kingdom , for which you are suffering .
It is a righteous thing for God to repay with affliction great suffering and distress those who afflict you .
You who are afflicted rest with us at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of his power in flaming fire .
They will render vengeance to those who do not know God , and to those who do not obey the good news of our Lord Jesus .
They will suffer punishment , even eternal destruction from the Lord and from the glory of his might .
He will then come to be glorified in his holy ones , and to be marveled at by all those who believed , because our testimony to you was believed .
We pray always for you , that our God may count you worthy of your calling , and fulfill every desire of goodness and every work of faith with power .
May the name of our Lord Jesus be glorified in you , and you in him , according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ .
Now we ask you , brothers , concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , and our gathering together to him ,
do not get upset right away or alarmed when someone claims that we said through some spirit , conversation , or letter that the » Day of Jehovah « has already come .
Do not let anyone deceive you about this in any way . That day will not come unless apostasy a falling away from truth takes place first , and the man of lawlessness sin , the man of destruction , is revealed .
He opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god and object of worship . As a result , he seats himself in the sanctuary of God and declares promotes himself to be like God .
Do you remember that I repeatedly told you about these things when I was still with you ?
There is something that keeps this from happening now , and you know what it is . At the proper time , then , the wicked one will appear .
The secret of evil lawlessness is even now at work . But there is one who restrains the evil till he is taken out of the way .
Then the evil lawless one will be revealed . The Lord Jesus will put him to death with the breath of his mouth , and destroy him by the manifestation brightness advent revelation of his coming . Greek : parousia : presence , return , being near
The evil lawless one will come with the power of Satan and perform all kinds of false signs and wonders .
He will use every kind of wicked deceit on those who will perish . They will perish because they did not welcome and love the truth so as to be saved .
So God dispatches the power of deceit error to work in them so that they are allowed to believe what is false .
Then everyone who did not believe the truth , but was delighted with wickedness , will be condemned .
We always have to thank God for you , brothers . Jehovah loves you and we thank God that in the beginning he chose you to be saved through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth .
It was for this he called you through our good news . This is so you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
So then , brothers , stand firm and hold to the precepts Greek : paradosis : traditions of doctrines , teachings handed down you were taught by word of mouth or by letter from us .
Now may our Lord Jesus Christ and God our Father , who has loved us and given us everlasting comfort and good hope by grace ,
comfort and strengthen your hearts in every good word and work .
Finally , brothers , pray for us that the word of God will spread rapidly and be glorified , just as it did also with you .
Pray that we may be delivered rescued from perverse and evil men , for not all have faith .
But the Lord is faithful , and He will strengthen and protect you from the evil one .
We have confidence in the Lord about you , that you are doing and will continue to do what we command .
May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patience steadfastness of Christ .
Our friends , we command you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to keep away from all believers who walk disorderly and who do not follow the instructions that we gave them .
You know what you must do to imitate us . We lived a disciplined life among you .
We did not eat anyone’s food without paying for it . Instead , we worked hard and struggled night and day in order not to be a burden to any of you .
It is not because we do not have the right , but to make ourselves an example for you to imitate us .
While we were with you , we used to tell you : » Whoever refuses to work is not allowed to eat . «
We say this because we hear that there are people among you who are lazy and who do nothing except meddle in other people’s business .
In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ , we command and warn them to lead orderly lives and work to earn their own living .
Brothers , do not grow weary of doing good .
If anyone does not obey our word in this letter , take special note of that person and do not associate with him , so that he will be put to shame .
Do not regard him as an enemy . Admonish him as a brother .
Now may the Lord of peace always grant you peace in every circumstance . The Lord be with you all !
I , Paul , write this greeting with my own hand , and this is a mark in every letter ; this is the way I write .
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all .
Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Savior , and Christ Jesus our hope ,
to Timothy , my true child in the faith : Grace , mercy , peace , from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord .
As I urged you to stay at Ephesus , when I was going into Macedonia , that you might command certain men not to teach strange doctrines .
They should not pay attention to myths and endless genealogies . These myths false stories fabrications and genealogies stimulate questions and speculation . They do not enhance the administration of God that is by faith .
But the objective is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith without hypocrisy .
Some have turned aside to vain talk by deviating from these things .
They want to be teachers of the Law even though they do not know what they are talking about . They do not understand what they say or what they confidently affirm .
But we know that the Law is good , if a man uses it legitimately .
Knowing this , that Law is not made for a righteous person . It is for the lawless and unruly , the ungodly and sinners , for the unholy and profane , for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers , and for manslayers .
It is for fornicators , for abusers of themselves with men , for kidnappers , for liars , for perjurers , and everything else that is contrary to the sound teaching .
Sound teaching doctrine is according to the good news of the glory of the blessed happy God . This was committed to my trust .
I thank him that enabled me and counted me faithful , appointing me to his service , Christ Jesus our Lord .
I was a blasphemer , and a persecutor , and a violent aggressor . I was shown mercy , because I did it ignorantly in unbelief .
The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love in Christ Jesus .
Faithful is the saying , and worthy of acceptance , that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners , of whom I am foremost .
For this I obtained mercy , which in me as the foremost sinner Jesus Christ might show his long-suffering . This is for an example to those who should later believe in him for eternal life .
Now to the King eternal , immortal , invisible , the only God , be honor and glory forever and ever . Amen .
I entrust this command to you , Timothy , my son . It is in accordance with the prophecies that were previously made . They do apply to you , and with them you may fight the good fight .
Keep the faith and maintain a good conscience ! Some have rejected these things and have suffered shipwreck to their faith .
Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander . I handed them over to Satan , so that they will be taught not to blaspheme .
I urge that entreaties and prayers , petitions and thanksgivings , be made on behalf of all men ,
They should be made for kings and all who are in authority , so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity .
This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior .
It is God’s desire that all men have salvation and come to the full precise accurate correct knowledge Greek : epignosis : recognition , discernment of the truth .
There is one God , and one mediator between God and men , the man Christ Jesus .
He gave himself as a ransom for all . A witness was to be given at the right time .
Because of this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle . What I say is true , not false , and I am a teacher of the nations in the true faith .
I want the men in every place to pray , lifting up holy hands , without anger or argument .
Likewise I want women to be adorned in modest clothing , with modesty and soundness of mind ; not with braided hair , and gold or pearls or costly clothes ;
but that which becomes a woman professing godliness through good works .
Let a woman learn in silence with all subjection .
I do not permit a woman to teach or have dominion over a man , but to remain quiet .
Adam was first formed and then Eve .
Adam was not deceived , but the woman being deceived fell into transgression .
She will be saved through her childbearing , if they continue in faith , love , and sanctification with sobriety .
Faithful is the saying : If a man seeks the office of overseer , he desires a good work .
The overseer therefore must be without reproach , the husband of one wife , temperate in habits , sound in mind , orderly , hospitable , qualified to teach ;
not addicted to wine , not quarrelsome ; but gentle , not contentious , no lover of money ;
one who manages well his own house , having his children in subjection with all seriousness ;
if a man does not know how to rule his own house , how will he take care of the congregation of God ?
He should not be a new believer , so that he will not become conceited and fall into the condemnation of the Devil .
He must have a good reputation with those outside the congregation , so that he will not fall into reproach and the snare of the Devil .
Ministerial servants should likewise be men of dignity , not double-tongued , or addicted to much wine or fond of sordid gain .
They should maintain the secret of the faith with a clear conscience .
Let these be tested first . Then let them serve as servants , if they are blameless .
Women in like manner must be serious , not slanderers , temperate , faithful in all things .
Let servants be husbands of one wife , ruling their children and their own houses well .
For they that have served well as servants gain to themselves a good standing and great confidence boldness of speech in the faith which is in Christ Jesus .
I write these things to you , hoping to come to you shortly ,
though if I am delayed , so that you may know how men ought to behave themselves in the household of God , which is the congregation of the living God , the pillar and support of the truth .
The secret of godliness is great and it is without controversy . ‘ He Jesus Christ was manifested revealed in the flesh , justified in the Spirit , and seen by angels . He preached among the nations , was believed on in the world , and received up in glory . ’
The Spirit explicitly says that some will fall away from the faith truth in later times . Spirits and doctrines of demons will seduce them ,
through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies , branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron .
They will forbid marrying , and command to abstain from food , which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth .
For every creature of God is good , and nothing is to be rejected , if it is received with thanksgiving .
This is because it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer .
If you tell the brothers about these things , you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus , nourished in the words of the faith , and of the good doctrine which you have followed until now .
Refuse false stories and old wives' fables . Train yourself with godliness in mind .
Bodily exercise is profitable for a little . However , godliness is profitable for all things , having promise of the life that now is and of the life that is to come .
Faithful and worthy of full acceptance is the statement .
This is why we labor and strive , because we have our hope set on the living God , who is the Savior of all men , especially of those who believe .
Command and teach these things .
Let no man look down on your youth . Be an example to the believers in speech and conduct , in love , in faith and chasteness .
Till I come , give attention to reading , to exhortation , to teaching .
Do not neglect the spiritual gift in you . It was given to you by prophecy , with the laying on of the hands of the elders .
Be diligent and think about these things . Give yourself wholly to them . That way your progress may be apparent to all .
Pay attention to yourself and to your teaching . Continue in these things . When you do this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you .
Do not rebuke censure criticize an elder , but appeal to him as a father , the younger men as brothers .
Treat the elder women as mothers , the younger as sisters , with much honor .
Honor widows that are truly widows .
But if any widow has children or grandchildren , let them learn first to show righteousness towards their own family , and to repay their parents : for this is acceptable in the sight of God .
Now she that is a widow indeed , and desolate , has her hope set on God , and continues in supplications and prayers day and night .
But she that gives herself to pleasure is dead while she lives .
Command these things that they may be without reproach .
If any do not provide for his own , and specially his own household , he denies the faith , and is worse than an unbeliever .
Let a widow be put on the list if she is under sixty years old , having been the wife of one man ,
having a good reputation for good works , if she has brought up children , if she has been hospitable to strangers , if she has washed the feet of the holy ones , if she has relieved the afflicted , if she has diligently followed every good work .
Refuse younger widows : for when their sexual impulses come between them and Christ , they desire to marry .
They have judgment , because they have rejected their first pledge .
They also learn to be idle , going about from house to house ; and not only idle , but gossipers and busybodies , speaking things that they should not .
I desire therefore that the younger widows marry , bear children , rule the household , and give no occasion to the adversary for reviling .
Some have already turned aside after Satan .
If any woman that believes has dependant widows , she must assist them and not let the congregation be burdened . Then it can assist those who are actually widows .
Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor , especially those who labor in the word and in teaching .
For the scripture said : » You must not muzzle the bull while he is threshing . The workman is worthy of his wages . «
Do not offer an accusation against an elder , except at the mouth of two or three witnesses .
Reprove the sinner in the sight of all , that the rest also may be in fear .
I charge you in the sight of God , and Christ Jesus , and the chosen angels , that you observe these principles without prejudice , doing nothing by partiality .
Do not lay your hands hastily on any man , neither be a partaker of other men's sins : keep yourself pure .
Do not drink water any longer , but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your many infirmities .
Some men's sins are known publicly , leading to judgment ; and some men’s sin becomes known later .
In like manner some good works are known publicly , and other works will be known , for they cannot be kept hidden .
Let as many as are servants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor , that the name of God and the teachings will not be blasphemed .
Do not despise your believing masters , because they are brothers . Serve them , because they who partake of the benefit are believing and beloved . Teach and exhort these things .
If any man teaches a different doctrine , and does not consent to sound words , even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ , and to the doctrine that is according to godliness ,
he is proud , knows nothing , has a morbid interest in questions and disputes about words , which leads to envy , strife , abusive language , evil suspicions ,
frictions between men corrupted in mind and lacking in truth , supposing that godliness is a way of gain .
Godliness with contentment is great gain .
We brought nothing into the world and we can carry nothing out .
We should be content with having food and covering .
Those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and hurtful lusts . These draw men into ruin and destruction .
For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil . Some by longing for it have been led away from the faith . They have pierced themselves through with many sorrows .
But you , O man of God , run from these things . Pursue set your heart on righteousness , godliness , faith , love , patience and meekness .
Fight the good fight of the faith ! Lay hold on everlasting life ! You were called and confessed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses .
I charge you in the sight of God , who gives life to all things , and of Christ Jesus , who before Pontius Pilate witnessed the good confession :
Keep the commandment without spot and without reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ .
The blessed and only Potentate Sovereign Authority will make him appear in his own appointed time . For he is the King of kings and Lord of lords .
Only God has immortality , dwelling in unapproachable light . No man has seen him , nor can see him . To him be honor and power forever . Amen .
Command those who are rich in this present system not to be high-minded arrogant , not to have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches , but on God , who gives us richly all things to enjoy .
They should do good works and be rich in good works , that they are ready to distribute , willing to communicate .
They store up for them a good foundation for the time to come , that they may lay hold on the life that is life indeed .
O Timothy , guard that which is committed to you . Turn away from the empty speeches that violate what is holy and from opposition and from false » knowledge . «
Some have professed this knowledge and erred concerning the faith . Grace be with you .
Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , according to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus ,
to Timothy , my dearly beloved son : Grace , mercy , and peace , from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord .
I thank God , whom I serve with a clear conscience as my forefathers did , that without ceasing , I remember you in my prayers , day and night .
I greatly desire to see you , being mindful of your tears , for this will fill me with joy .
I am mindful of your sincere faith , which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice , and I am sure that it is in you as well .
For this reason I remind you to kindle afresh the gift of God that is in you because of the laying on of my hands .
God has not given us a spirit of timidity fear , but of power and love and discipline .
Do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord or of me his prisoner . Join me in suffering for the good news according to the power of God .
God has saved us and called us with a holy calling . This is not according to our works , but according to his purpose and grace that was granted us in Christ Jesus , from all eternity .
The appearance of our Savior Christ Jesus revealed this . Jesus abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the good news .
I was appointed to be a messenger of this good news , an apostle , and a teacher .
It is for this reason that I suffer these things . But I am still full of confidence , because I know whom I have believed , and I am convinced that he is able to keep safe until that day what he has entrusted to me .
Hold firmly to the true words that I taught you , as the example for you to follow . Remain in the faith and love that are ours in union with Christ Jesus .
Through the power of the Holy Spirit , who lives in us . Keep guard obey preserve the good things that have been entrusted to you .
You know that all that are in Asia turned away from me . This includes Phygelus and Hermogenes .
The Lord grants mercy to the house of Onesiphorus : for he often refreshed me , and was not ashamed of my chains .
When he was in Rome , he sought me diligently , and found me .
May the Lord grant him to find the mercy of God in that day , and in how many things he ministered at Ephesus , you know very well .
You therefore , my child , be strengthened in the grace loving-kindness that is in Christ Jesus .
What you have heard from me through many witnesses entrust to faithful people who will be able to teach others as well .
You must endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ .
No soldier entangles himself in the affairs of this life . That way , he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier .
If anyone competes as an athlete , he does not win the prize unless he competes according to the rules .
The hard-working farmer should be first to receive his share of the crops .
Consider what I say , for the Lord will give you understanding in all things .
Remember that Jesus Christ was raised from the dead . He is a descendant of David , according to my good news .
I suffer hardship even to imprisonment as a criminal . But the word of God is not imprisoned .
For this reason I endure all things for the sake of the chosen , so that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus and with it eternal glory .
This is a faithful saying : If we died with him , we will also live with him .
If we endure , we will also reign with Him . If we deny him , He will deny us !
If we are faithless , He remains faithful , for He cannot deny himself .
Remind them of these things , and charge them before God not to argue about words . This is useless and leads to the ruin of the hearers .
Be diligent to be presented approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed , accurately handling the word of truth .
But avoid worldly and empty discussion , for it will lead to further ungodliness .
This kind of talk will spread like gangrene . Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus .
These men have gone astray from the truth . They say that the resurrection has already taken place , and they upset the faith of some .
The foundation of God stands firm having this seal : » Jehovah knows those who belong to him , « and : » Everyone who names the name of Jehovah is to abstain from wickedness . «
Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver vessels , but also vessels of wood and of earthenware , and some to honor and some to dishonor .
If anyone cleanses himself from these things , he will be a vessel for honor , sanctified , useful to the Master , prepared for every good work .
Flee from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness , faith , love , and peace , with those who call on the Lord with a clean heart .
But refuse foolish and ignorant speculations , knowing they produce quarrels controversy fighting .
The Lord’s servant must not be quarrelsome , but be kind gentle to all , able to teach , and patient when wronged .
He should instruct those who oppose using meekness . Perhaps God will give them repentance that they may know the truth .
They should come to their senses out of the snare of the Devil . He has taken them captive and they do his will .
Know this also that in the last days perilous dangerous times will come .
For men will be lovers of their own selves , covetous lovers of money , arrogant , proud , blasphemers , disobedient to parents , unthankful ungrateful , unholy ,
unloving , unforgiving , slanderers , without self-control , fierce , despisers of those who are good ,
traitors , headstrong , haughty , lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God ;
having a form of godliness , but denying its power . Stay away from people like this !
Among them are those who creep into houses and lead captive gullible women loaded down with sins , led away with various lusts .
They are constantly learning , and never able to grasp the knowledge of the truth .
And even as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses , so do these also withstand the truth . Men corrupted in mind , rejected concerning the faith ,
they will make no progress ; for their foolishness will be evident to all men , as theirs also came to be .
You carefully follow my teaching in conduct , purpose , faith , longsuffering , love , and patience ,
and also persecutions and sufferings . The things that happened to me at Antioch , at Iconium , at Lystra ; what persecutions I endured . Out of them the Lord delivered me .
Yes , and all who would live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution .
But evil men and impostors will become worse and worse , deceiving and being deceived .
Continue in the things you have learned and have been assured of , knowing from whom you have learned them .
From childhood you have known the sacred writings that are able to make you wise to salvation through faith that is in Christ Jesus .
God inspired all Scripture ! It is profitable for teaching , for reproof , for correction , and for instruction in righteousness . Greek : theopneustos : God-breathed
Thus the man of God may be completely equipped for every good work .
I solemnly charge you in the sight presence of God , and of Christ Jesus , who will judge the living and the dead , and by his appearing and his kingdom :
preach the word ; be urgent in season and out of season ; reprove , rebuke , exhort , with all long-suffering and teaching .
For the time will come when they will not endure the sound doctrine . Having their ears tickled , they will accumulate teachers who follow after their own lusts .
They will turn their ears away from the truth , and turn aside to myths fiction .
Be sober in all things , suffer hardship , do the work of an evangelist preacher of the good news , and fulfill your ministry .
I am already being offered poured out as an offering , and the time of my departure has come .
I have fought the good fight ! I have finished the course ! I have kept the faith !
The crown of righteousness is laid up for me . The Lord , the righteous judge , will give it to me at that day ; and not to me only , but also to all those who have loved his appearing manifestation .
Do your best to come to me shortly .
For Demas forsook me , having loved this present world , and went to Thessalonica . Crescens went to Galatia , Titus to Dalmatia .
Only Luke is with me . Take Mark with you , for he is useful to me for ministering .
I sent Tychicus to Ephesus .
When you come , bring the books , parchments , and the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus .
Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil : God will render to him according to his works .
You should also beware of him , for he intensely opposed our words .
At first no one defended me . They all abandoned me . May it not be counted against them .
But the Lord stood by me , and strengthened me ; that through me the message might be fully proclaimed , and that all the people of the nations might hear . I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion Satan the Devil great danger .
The Lord will deliver me from every evil work . He will save me to his heavenly kingdom . To him is the glory forever and ever . Amen .
Greet Prisca and Aquila and the house of Onesiphorus .
Erastus remained at Corinth , but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick .
Do your utmost to come before winter . Eubulus greets you , and Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brothers .
The Lord be with your spirit mental disposition attitude . Grace be with you .
Paul , a servant of God , and an apostle of Jesus Christ , according to the faith of God's chosen ones , and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness .
It is in hope of eternal life , which God , who cannot lie , promised before times eternal .
In his own time he made his word known through the message that was entrusted to me according to the commandment of God our Savior .
To Titus , my true child sharing a common faith : Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior .
I left you in Crete for this purpose , that you should correct the things that were defective , and appoint elders in every city , as I gave you orders .
A blameless man will be the husband of one wife . He will have children that believe and who are not accused of violence and disobedience .
The overseer must be blameless as God's steward . He must not be self-willed , not prone to anger , not a brawler , and not violent quarrelsome pugnacious , not greedy of dishonest gain .
but given to hospitality , as a lover of good , sober-minded , just , holy , self-controlled ;
holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching , that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine , and to reprove refute rebuke those who contradict .
There are many unruly rebellious men , vain talkers , and deceivers , especially those of the circumcision .
They must be stopped . Their mouths must be shut up , for they subvert entire households . They teach things that should not be taught , for the sake of dishonest gain .
One of them , a prophet of their own , said : » Cretans are always liars , evil beasts , and idle gluttons . «
This testimony is true . For this cause reprove them sharply , that they may be sound in the faith ,
not giving heed to Jewish fables , and commandments of men who turn away from the truth .
To the pure all things are pure , but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure . Both their mind and their conscience are defiled .
They profess that they know God ; but deny him by their works ! They are detestable , disobedient , and not approved for any good work .
Teach sound doctrine .
Aged men should be temperate , serious , sound in mind , sound in faith , in love , and in endurance .
Aged women likewise should be reverent in behavior and teachers of that which is good . They should not be slanderers nor enslaved to too much wine .
They may train the young women to love their husbands , to love their children ,
to be sober minded , chaste , workers at home , kind , being in subjection to their own husbands , that the word of God will not be defamed dishonored .
Urge the younger men to be sound in mind .
Be an example of good works in all things , showing no corruption in your doctrine .
Have sound speech that cannot be condemned so the man opposing us may be ashamed and have nothing bad to say about us .
Servants should to be in subjection to their masters overseers employers . They should please them in all things and not talk back .
They should not steal from them , but should show good fidelity that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things .
For the grace divine influence of God has been revealed , bringing salvation to all men ,
instructing us , to the intent that , denying ungodliness and worldly lusts , we should live soberly and righteously and godly in this present age world period of time .
Look for the blessed hope and appearance of the glory of the great God . And look for our Savior , Jesus Christ .
He Jesus Christ gave himself for us , that he might redeem us from all iniquity , and purify a people for himself , who are special people , zealous for good works .
Speak and exhort and reprove these things with all authority . Let no man despise you .
Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities , to be obedient , and to be ready to do every good work ,
to speak evil of no man , not to be contentious , to be gentle , showing all meekness toward all men .
For we also once were foolish , disobedient , deceived , serving various lusts and pleasures , living in malice and envy , hateful , hating one another .
When the kindness of God our Savior , and his love toward man , appeared ,
not by works done in righteousness , which we did , but according to his mercy he saved us , through the washing of regeneration restoration spiritual rebirth and renewing renovation of the Holy Spirit .
He poured Spirit out upon us richly , through Jesus Christ our Savior .
Being justified by his grace loving kindness , we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life .
Faithful is the saying , and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently , to the end that they who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works . These things are good and profitable to men .
You should avoid foolish arguing and dissentions , questioning ; and genealogies , and arguing about law , for they are unprofitable and vain .
A divisive and dissentious man should be admonished , and after two times have nothing to do with that man .
You know that man sins and is perverted . He is self-condemned .
When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you , give diligence to come to me at Nicopolis where I will winter .
Send Zenas , the lawyer , and Apollos on their journey quickly and see that they lack nothing .
Help our people learn to maintain good works for necessary uses , that they are not unfruitful .
All that are with me greet you . Greet those who love us in the faith . Grace be with you all .
Paul , a prisoner of Christ Jesus , and Timothy , our brother , to Philemon , our beloved fellow worker ,
and to Apphia , our sister , and to Archippus , our fellow soldier , and to the congregation in your house :
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
I thank my God always , making mention of you in my prayers .
I hear about your love , and about the faith you have toward the Lord Jesus , and toward all the holy ones .
May the fellowship of your faith operate in the knowledge of every good thing that is in you for Jesus Christ .
For I have much joy and comfort in your love , because the hearts of the holy ones have been refreshed through you , brother .
I have all boldness in Christ to tell you what is appropriate .
Because of love I appeal to you , since I am Paul , the aged . I am also a prisoner of Christ Jesus .
I appeal to you for my child , Onesimus , whom I have begotten in my imprisonment .
He was once worthless to you , but now is useful to you and me .
I send him back to you , like sending my heart .
I would have kept him with me , that in your behalf he might minister to me in my imprisonment for the good news .
Without your agreement I would do nothing . Your goodness should not be out of necessity , but of free will .
Perhaps he was separated from you for a season , that you should have him forever .
He is no longer a servant . He is more than a servant . He is a beloved brother , especially to me , but also to you , both in the flesh and in the Lord .
If you count me as a partner , receive him as you would me .
But if he has wronged you and owes you anything at all , charge this to me .
I Paul write with my own hand . I will repay . I do not say that you owe your own self life to me .
Yes , brother , let me have joy in you in the Lord . Refresh my heart in Christ .
I have confidence in your obedience . I write you , knowing that you will do beyond what I say .
Prepare a lodging for me . I hope that through your prayers I shall be given to you .
Epaphras , my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus , greets you .
So do Mark , Aristarchus , Demas , and Luke , my fellow workers .
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with your spirit mental disposition attitude . Amen .
Long ago on many occasions and in many ways God spoke to our fathers through the prophets .
He has in these last days spoken to us by his Son , whom he has appointed heir of all things , through whom he made the ages Greek : aion : ages of time , perpetuity , worlds , generations , human entities .
God’s Son is the brightness of his glory , and the express image of his being . He sustains all things by his powerful word . After Jesus purged our sins , he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high .
He has become better than the angels and has inherited a more excellent name than theirs .
To which of the angels did God ever say at any time : » You are my son ; this day I have begotten you « ? And again : » I will be to him a father , and he shall be to me a son « ?
And again : when he brings the firstborn into the world , he says : » Let all the angels of God pay him homage . «
Of the angels he says : » He makes his angels spirits , and his ministers a flame of fire . «
But he says to the Son : » God is your throne forever and ever . Your throne , Oh God-like one , is forever . : A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom .
» You have loved righteousness , and hated iniquity . Therefore God , your God , has anointed you with the oil of gladness more than your companions . «
And , You , Lord , in the beginning have laid the foundation of the earth ; and the heavens are the works of your hands .
» They will perish but you remain . They will all grow old like a garment .
» Just as a coat you fold them up , and they will be changed : but you are the same , and your years will never run out . «
To which of the angels did he say at any time : » Sit on my right hand , until I make your enemies your footstool « ?
Are they not all ministering spirits , sent to minister for those who will be heirs of salvation ?
Pay close attention to the things heard so we do not drift away .
If the word spoken through angels was steadfast , and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward penalty .
How shall we escape , if we neglect such a great salvation ? It was first presented by the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard him .
God also testified about it with signs , wonders , and various miracles , and gifts of the Holy Spirit given according to his will .
He did not subject the world to come that we speak about to the angels .
But a certain witness has given proof , saying : » What is man , that you are mindful of him ? Or what is the son of man that you take care of him ?
» You made him a little lower than the angels for a little while . Greek : brachus , short time You crowned him with glory and honor , and set him over the works of your hands .
» You put all things in subjection under his feet . « You subjected all things to him and left nothing that is not subject to him . Now we do not see yet all things in subjection to him .
We see Jesus , who was made a little lower than the angels and crowned with glory and honor for suffering death . By the grace of God he tasted death for every man .
It was appropriate that he , for whom and by whom all things exist , should bring many sons to glory , to make the Chief Agent of their salvation perfect through suffering .
Both he who sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all from one . For this reason Jesus is not ashamed to call them » brothers « .
He says : » I will declare your name to my brothers ; in the middle of the congregation I will sing praises to you . «
And again : » I will put my trust in him . « And again : » Behold , the children that Jehovah has given me . «
Since the » children « are partakers of flesh and blood , he also took part of the same things , that through death he might destroy him that had the power to cause death , Satan the Devil .
And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage .
He does not help the angels , but he helps the seed of Abraham .
This means that he had to become like his » brothers « in every way , in order to be their faithful and merciful High Priest in his service to God , in order to offer a propitiatory sacrifice pay atonement to make reconciliation for the sins of the people .
Since he has suffered and was tested in every way ; he is able to help those who are being tested .
Holy brothers , partakers of the heavenly calling , consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession , Jesus .
He was faithful to Him who appointed him , just as Moses was in His entire house .
He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses . This is because the builder of the house has more honor than the house .
Every house has a builder . God is the builder of all things .
Indeed Moses was faithful in His house , as a ministering servant , for a testimony of the things to be spoken afterwards .
Christ was faithful as a Son over God’s house . We are His house if we hold on to our courage confidence and rejoice speak boldly about our hope until the end .
The Holy Spirit says : » Today if you will hear his voice ,
» do not harden your hearts and be stubborn like those who tested me in the day of temptation in the wilderness .
» Your forefathers examined inspected scrutinized me by proving testing me . And they saw my works for forty years .
» I was disgusted angry with this generation , and said : ‘ They always go astray in their hearts , and they have not known my ways . ’
» So I swore in my anger : ‘ They will not enter into my rest . ’ «
Be careful , brothers and sisters , that none of you develop a wicked heart lacking faith and turning away departing from the living God .
Encourage yourselves each day , as long as it is called » Today , « that none of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin .
For we have become companions partners with Christ if indeed we hold the beginning of our firm trust to the end .
Scripture says : » Today if you will hear his voice , do not harden your hearts . Do not be stubborn like those who rebelled . «
Who were they who heard God and rebelled ? All who came out of Egypt with Moses rebelled .
With whom was he disgusted for forty years ? He was disgusted and angry with those who sinned and died in the desert .
Who did God swear would never enter his rest ? He was talking about those who did not obey him .
We see that they could not enter in on account of a lack of faith unbelief disobedience .
While the promise of entering his rest remains , let us fear that one of you might come up short and not enter .
Indeed , we have had good news presented to us . They also had it . But the word that was heard did not benefit them because they were not united in faith by what was heard .
We who believe enter into the rest . As God said : » I swore in my anger : ‘ They shall not enter into my rest . ’ « Yet God’s works were completed from the foundation of the world .
Somewhere God said this about the seventh day : » God rested on the seventh day from all his works . «
Again : » They shall not enter into my rest . «
It remains for some to enter into it . Those who first received the good news did not enter in because they did not obey and lacked faith .
He determines a certain day by saying through David : » Today , « after so long a time ; just as it was said before , » Today , if you will listen to his voice , do not harden your hearts . «
If Joshua had given them rest , he God would not have spoken afterwards about another day .
There remains then a Sabbath rest for the people of God .
He who enters into his rest also rests from his own works , just as God did from his .
Let us do our utmost to enter into that rest . Let no one fall into the same pattern of disobedience by not obeying the word .
The Word of God is alive and active and sharper than any two-edged sword . It separates the physical person from the spiritual person , of both joints and marrow . And it can discern judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart .
Nothing in all creation is hidden from God . All things are uncovered and laid bare before him . We must account to him .
We have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens , Jesus the Son of God , so let us hold fast our confession .
We do not have a high priest who is not able to sympathize with our infirmities weaknesses . He was tested in all things like ourselves . Yet he was without sin !
Let us approach the throne of grace loving-kindness with confidence , that we may receive mercy , and find grace for help in time of need .
Every high priest taken from among men is appointed in behalf of men in things relating to God . He may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins .
He is able to exercise compassion towards the ignorant and those going astray , since he is also subject to weakness .
That is why he must offer sacrifices , for his own and for the people’s sins .
No one takes this honor upon himself . He is called by God , even as Aaron was .
Also Christ did not glorify himself to be made a high priest . It was God who said to him : » You are my Son ; I today have become your father . «
As he said in another place : « You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek . «
In the days of his life on earth , when he Christ offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to the one who was able to save him out of death , and was heard because of his godly reverence .
Although he was a Son , he learned obedience from the things he suffered .
Being made perfect , he became the source cause channel conduit pathway facilitator of eternal salvation to all who obey him .
He was called by God to be a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek .
We have many things to say about him and it is hard to explain it to you , for you are dull of hearing slow to learn .
At this time you should be teachers . But you need someone to teach you again from the beginning the elementary truths from the Word of God . You need milk , not solid food .
Everyone who drinks milk is unacquainted with the word of righteousness : for he is a babe .
But solid food belongs to mature people . It belongs to those who by reason of use have their senses trained to know the difference between good and evil .
Therefore leaving the elementary truths of the doctrine of Christ let us move on to maturity . Let us not lay again the foundation of repentance from dead works , and of faith toward God .
We should not repeat the basic teachings about baptisms , and of the laying on of hands setting apart for holy tasks , and of resurrection of the dead , and of eternal judgment .
We will do this if God permits .
Those who were once enlightened , and have tasted of the heavenly gift , and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit ,
and have tasted the good Word of God , and the powers of the age to come ,
if they shall fall away , it is impossible to renew them again to repentance . This is because they personally impale the Son of God again , and expose him to public shame .
The earth that drinks in the rain that comes upon it , and brings forth vegetation for those by whom it was cultivated , receives blessing from God .
That which bears thorns and briars is rejected , and is near to being cursed . It ends up being burned .
Even though we speak this way , beloved , we are convinced that you will have better things , things that belong to salvation .
For God is not unrighteous unjust to forget your work and the love you showed for his name . You ministered to the holy ones and continue to minister .
We desire that every one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope down to the end .
We desire that you are not lazy , but follow those who through faith and patience inherit the promises .
When God made a promise to Abraham , he could swear by no one greater then himself , so he swore by himself .
He said : » I will surely bless you and give you many descendants . «
After waiting patiently , Abraham received the promise .
Men swear by someone greater then themselves : and an oath for confirmation to them puts an end to the problem .
When God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose , he confirmed it with an oath .
God did this to offer encouragement so we may rely on the hope offered to us . We have taken refuge in that hope and it is impossible for God to lie . These two things can never be changed .
We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of life . It is a hope that enters into the inner shrine behind the curtain .
That is where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf . He has become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek .
Melchizedek , king of Salem , priest of the Most High God , met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him .
Abraham apportioned a tenth part of everything to him . He was first of all , by translation of his name , » King of Righteousness , « and then he was also ruler of Salem , which means , » King of Peace . «
He was without father or mother or genealogy , and neither had beginning of days nor end of life , but resembling the Son of God , he continues as a priest forever .
See how great he was ! Abraham the patriarch gave him a tenth of the spoils .
The descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the Law to take tithes from the people . This is from their brothers , for these are descended from Abraham .
But this man does not have their genealogy . He received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises .
It is beyond dispute that the superior blesses the inferior .
In this instance mortal men receive tithes , in the other by the one of whom it is testified that he lives .
One might even say that Levi , the priest who takes the tenth from the people , gave his tenth through Abraham .
He was still in the loins of his ancestor not yet born when Melchizedek met him .
If perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood , for under it the people received the Law , what further need would there have been for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek , instead of one named after the order of Aaron ?
The priesthood was changed , and therefore it is necessary to also change the Law .
The one about whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe , from which no one has officiated at the altar .
It is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah , a tribe with reference to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests .
This is clear if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek ,
He would become such , not on the basis of a law of physical requirement , but according to the power of an indestructible life .
For it is announced : » You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek . «
The former commandment was set aside because it was weak and useless .
The Law could not make anything perfect . A better hope has been provided through which we can draw near to God .
It was not without an oath . Others were made priest without any oath .
He became a priest with an oath when God said to him : » Jehovah has sworn and he will feel no regret , you are a priest forever . «
Jesus became the guarantee of a better covenant .
There have been many priests . This is because they have been prevented from continuing by death .
He continues forever and therefore has his priesthood without change .
He is able to save completely those who approach God through him , because he is always alive to intercede for them .
Such a high priest as this was suitable for us . He is holy , harmless , undefiled , separated from sinners , and higher than the heavens .
He does not have a day-by-day need as the high priests do , first to offer up sacrifices for his own sins , then for those of the people . He sacrificed for sin once for all when he offered up himself .
The Law appoints men as high priests who have weakness . But the oath that came after the Law appointed the Son who is perfect forever .
Here is a summary of the things we are discussing : We have this kind of high priest . He sat down at the right hand of the throne of the majesty in heaven .
He is a minister of the Holy Place and of the true Tabernacle , built by Jehovah and not man .
Every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices . It is necessary to have something to offer .
If he were on earth , he would not be a priest , for there are those who offer the gifts according to the Law .
The work they do as priests is only a copy and a shadow of what is in heaven . It is the same as it was with Moses . When he was about to build the sacred tent , God told him : » Be sure to make everything according to the pattern you were shown on the mountain . «
Jesus has obtained a more excellent ministry . The covenant that he arranged between God and his people is a better one , because it is based on promises of better things .
If there had been nothing wrong with the first covenant , there would not have been a need for a second one .
God finds fault with his people and said to them : » ‘ The time is coming , ’ ’ says Jehovah , ‘ when I will draw up a new covenant with the people of Israel and Judah .
» ‘ It will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors on the day I took them by the hand and led them out of Egypt . They were not faithful to the covenant I made with them , and so I paid no attention to them .
» ‘ This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , ’ ’ said Jehovah : ‘ I will put my teachings laws in their mind , I will write them upon their hearts deep thought understanding . I will be their God , and they will be my people .
» ‘ They will not teach a neighbor or brother saying : » Know Jehovah . « All will know me from the little one among them to the great among them .
» ‘ I will forgive their wickedness and I will remember their sins no more . ’ «
By calling this covenant » new , « he has made the first one old obsolete . That which grows old and aged will soon disappear .
The first covenant had ordinances for divine service , and an earthly sanctuary .
A tabernacle was set up . The first room was called » the Holy Place . « It contained the lamp stand and table and the consecrated bread .
Beyond the second curtain was a room called » the Most Holy Place . «
It had a golden incense burner . The Ark of the Covenant was completely covered with gold . It contained the golden pot that had the manna , and the rod of Aaron that had sprouted , and the tables of the covenant .
The cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy seat were above the Ark . Now is not the time to speak in detail .
When these things are prepared , the priests enter the outer room often to carry on their services .
Only the high priest enters the inner room . Once a year he entered with blood , which he offers for himself and for the sins of the people .
The Holy Spirit revealed that the way into the Most Holy Place was not open while the tent was still in use .
This is a symbol that points to the present time . It means that the offerings and animal sacrifices presented to God cannot make the worshiper’s heart perfect ,
since they have to do only with food , drink , and various purification ceremonies . These are all outward rules , which apply only until the time comes to change them for something better .
Christ came as the high priest of the good things that are now here . He also went into a much better tent that is not made by humans and does not belong to this creation .
He went once and forever into the Most Holy Place having eternal salvation . It is not with the blood of goats and young bulls , but with his blood .
The blood of goats and bulls , and the ashes from the burning of a young cow , sprinkled on the unclean made them outwardly clean .
The blood of Christ did even more . Through the eternal Spirit he offered himself without blemish to God and cleansed your conscience from dead works . Now we can serve worship the living God .
For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant . A death has taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant . Those called may receive the promise of everlasting inheritance .
A will is used for a person who is dead . It becomes effective only when the person dies .
A will is in force after a person dies . Otherwise it is not in effect at all while the one who provided it lives .
The first covenant was dedicated with blood .
When Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the Law , he took the blood of calves and of goats , with water , and scarlet wool , and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book , and all the people ,
He said : » This is the blood of the covenant that God has presented to you . «
He sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle , and all the vessels of service .
Almost all things are by the Law purified with blood . There is no forgiveness unless blood is poured out .
It was necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these . But the heavenly things should be cleansed with better sacrifices than these .
Christ has not entered into the Holy Place made with human hands . This is a copy of the true one . He has entered into heaven to appear before the presence of God for us .
Neither should he offer himself as the high priest enters into the Holy Place every year with blood of others .
Otherwise he would have to suffer often from the founding of the world . He has presented himself once at the end of the age to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself .
It is appointed to men once to die , but after this the judgment :
So Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many . He will appear the second time without sin to those who look to him for their salvation .
The Law is a shadow of the good things to come . It is not the actual things . The continual yearly sacrifices can never make those who worship perfect .
If it could , it would cease to be offered . Once the worshipers were cleansed they would have no awareness of sin anymore .
These sacrifices are an annual reminder of sin .
It is not possible for the blood of bulls and of goats to take away sins .
When Christ came into the world he said : » ‘ Sacrifice and offering you did not desire , but you have prepared a body for me .
» ‘ You have no pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin . ’
» Then I said : ‘ I have come in the scroll of the book . It is written about me , to do your will , O God . ’ «
Then he said : » You did not want nor did you approve of sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin ; « which are offered by the Law .
He also said : » I come to do your will , O God . « He takes away the first in order to establish the second .
We are sanctified by his » will « through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all .
Every priest stands daily , serving and offering time after time the same sacrifices . Yet they can never take away sins .
But this man , after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever , sat down at the right hand of God ,
waiting until his enemies are placed as a stool for his feet .
With one offering he has perfected those who are sanctified forever .
The Holy Spirit also bears witness to us ; for after that he said :
» ‘ This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days , ’ ’ says Jehovah ; ‘ I will put my laws in their hearts , and in their minds will I write them . ’
» I will not remember their sins and unrighteousness . «
Where there is forgiveness for these , there is no more offering for sin .
Having therefore , brothers , boldness to enter into the Holy Place by the blood of Jesus ,
by a new and living way , which he consecrated for us , through the veil , that is to say , his flesh ,
having a high priest over the house of God ,
let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith , having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience , and our bodies washed with pure water .
Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering , for he is faithful that promised .
Let us consider one another to encourage love and good works :
Not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together , as the manner of some is , but exhorting one another , and even more , as you see the day approaching .
If we continue to practice deliberately persist in sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth , there remains no more sacrifice for sins .
But there remains a certain fearful expectation of judgment and a fiery indignation , which will devour God’s enemies .
He that despised Moses’ Law died without mercy under two or three witnesses .
What about those who despise the Son of God ? Those who treat as a cheap thing the blood of God’s covenant that purified them from sin ? Those who insult the Spirit of grace ? Think how much worse the punishment they deserve will be !
We know who said : » Vengeance is mine ; I will repay « ; and who also said , » Jehovah will judge his people . «
It is a dreadful terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
Remember the former days in which , after being enlightened , you endured great struggle with afflictions .
You were at times publicly insulted and mistreated . Other times you were ready to join those who were being treated in this way .
You shared the sufferings of prisoners . When all your belongings were seized , you endured your loss gladly . This is because you knew that you possessed something much better , which would last forever .
Do not lose your courage confidence boldness . It brings a great reward with it .
You need to persevere in order to do the will of God and receive what he promises .
» In just a little while , he who is coming will come . He will not delay ! «
» My righteous people will live by faith . If any of them turn back , I will not be pleased with them . «
We are not people who turn back and are destroyed . Instead , we have faith and are saved .
Faith is the assurance of things hoped for , and evidence of things not seen .
God approved of the men of old because of their faith .
By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the Word of God . The visible has been made out of things that were not visible .
By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain . Through this he was commended as righteous . God testified about his gifts . Thus through faith he still speaks even though he is dead .
By faith Enoch was moved transferred removed so that he would not see death . He was not found , because God had moved him away . Before he was moved away he saw that he had pleased God well .
Without faith it is impossible to please God . He who comes to God must believe that he is and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him .
By faith Noah , being warned by God about things not seen as yet , moved with godly respect . He prepared an ark to save his house . By his faith he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that is according to faith .
By faith , when Abraham was called , he obeyed . He went to a place that he was to receive for an inheritance . He went even though he did not know where he was going .
By faith he became an alien in the Promised Land . It was not his land . He lived in tents with Isaac and Jacob . They were heirs with him of the same promise .
He looked for the city having real foundations , whose builder and maker is God .
By faith Sarah received strength to conceive seed when she was past age , since she counted him faithful who promised .
This was to come from one man and him as good as dead . There were born children , as many as the stars of heaven in multitude , and as uncountable as the sand by the seashore .
These all died in faith , not having received the promises , but having seen them and greeted them from afar . They confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth .
Those who say such things declare that they are seeking a country of their own .
If indeed they had been thinking of that country from which they came , they would have had opportunity to return .
They desire a better country , that is , a heavenly one . Because of this , God is not ashamed to be called their God . He has prepared a city for them !
By faith Abraham , being tested , offered up Isaac . He that had gladly received the promises was offering up his only-begotten son !
It was said : » In Isaac your descendants will be called . «
Abraham reasoned that God is able to raise him from the dead . So he figured he would receive him back .
By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau , even concerning things to come .
By faith Jacob , when he was dying , blessed each of the sons of Joseph . He worshipped while leaning upon the top of his staff .
By faith Joseph , when his end was near , mentioned the departure of the children of Israel . Then he gave orders concerning his bones .
By faith Moses , when he was born , was hidden three months by his parents . They saw he was a beautiful child and they were not afraid of the king’s edict .
By faith Moses , when he grew up , refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter .
He chose to share the bad treatment with the people of God , rather than enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season .
He considered the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt . He looked intently respectfully for the payment of the reward .
By faith he left Egypt , not fearing the anger of the king . He endured , by seeing him who is invisible .
By faith he kept the Passover , and the sprinkling of the blood , that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them .
By faith they passed through the Red Sea as though they were on dry land . The Egyptians tried and were drowned .
By faith the walls of Jericho fell down , after they had been encircled for seven days .
By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish with the disobedient , after she welcomed the spies in peace .
What more shall I say ? For the time will fail me if I tell of Gideon , Barak , Samson , Jephthah , of David and Samuel and the prophets ,
who through faith subdued kingdoms , affected righteousness , obtained promises , stopped the mouths of lions ,
quenched the power of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , from weakness were made strong , became mighty in war , and turned to flight foreign armies .
Women received their dead by a resurrection , and others were tortured , not accepting their deliverance , that they might obtain a better resurrection :
And others had trial of cruel mocking and scourging and bonds and imprisonment .
They were stoned , they were sawed in two , were tempted , were slain with the sword ; they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins , being destitute , afflicted , tormented .
The world was not worthy of them ! They wandered in deserts , and in mountains , and in dens and caves of the earth .
And these all , having obtained a good report through faith , did not receive the promise .
God provided something better for us that they might not be made perfect without us .
A great cloud of witnesses surround us . Therefore let us lay aside every weight , and the sin that easily entangles us . Let us run with endurance the race that is set before us .
Look to consider without distractions Jesus , the Leader Predecessor and Finisher Perfecter of our faith . He despised the shame . He endured the stake for the joy that was set before him . Then he sat down at the right hand of the throne of God .
Consider him who endured such contrary talk by sinners against him . You should not get tired and give up in your mind heart .
You have not yet resisted by shedding blood in your striving against sin .
You have forgotten the exhortation that reasons with you as to sons : » My son , do not despise regard lightly discipline from Jehovah and do not lose heart when he corrects you .
» Jehovah disciplines those he loves . In fact he scourges every son child he receives . «
God deals with you like children . Endure discipline instruction training . Who is the child whom a father does not discipline ?
If you are without discipline , you are illegitimate children , and not sons .
Furthermore , we have had fathers of our flesh that corrected us , and we gave them respect . Shall we not much more be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live ?
They disciplined us for a few days for their own pleasure . He disciplines for our profit , that we might be partakers of his holiness .
Now no discipline for the present seems to be joyous . In fact it seems grievous ! Nevertheless , afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained .
Lift up the hands that hang down , and the feeble knees .
Make straight paths for your feet . Let that which is lame be turned out of the way , but rather let it be healed .
Pursue peace and holiness with all people , for no man will see the Lord without it .
See that no one misses the grace of God ; that no bitter root spring up to cause trouble and defile many .
Let no one become immoral or unspiritual like Esau . He sold his birthright for a single meal !
Afterward , you know , he wanted to receive inherit his father’s blessing . He was turned back , because he could not find any way to change what he had done . He was in tears when he looked for it .
You have not come to a mountain that can be touched , to Mount Sinai with its blazing fire , the darkness and the gloom , the storm .
You have not come to the blast of a trumpet , and the sound of a voice . When the people heard the voice , they begged not to hear another word .
They could not bear the order : » If even a beast touches the mountain , it will be stoned . «
The sight was so terrible formidable fearful that Moses said : » I am full of fear and trembling . «
You have come to Mount Zion , and to the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem , and to myriads thousands of thousands of angels ,
to the general assembly and congregation of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven , and to God the Judge of all , and to the spirits of just righteous holy men made perfect mature having all needed qualities .
You have come to Jesus , the mediator of a new covenant , and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks in a better way than the blood of Abel .
Be careful , then , and do not refuse to hear him who speaks . Those who refused to hear the one who gave the divine message on earth did not escape . How much less shall we escape then , if we turn away from the one who speaks from heaven !
His voice shook the earth then , but now he has promised : » I will once more shake not only the earth but also heaven . «
The words » once more « plainly show that the created things will be shaken and removed , so that the things that cannot be shaken will remain .
Let us be thankful , because we will receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken . Let us be grateful and worship serve intensely adore God in a way that will please him , with reverence and awe .
Our God is a destroying consuming fire .
You should continue to love one another as brothers .
Show hospitality to strangers , for some have entertained angels without knowing it .
Remember those who are in prison , as though you were in prison with them . Remember those who are suffering , as though you were suffering as they are .
Let marriage be honorable among all , and let the marriage bed be undefiled : for God will judge fornicators and adulterers .
You should be free from the love of money . Be content with what you have , for he has said : » I will not leave you . I will not forsake you . «
So that with good confidence courage we say : » Jehovah is my helper ; I will not fear : What shall man do to me ? «
Remember those who are taking the lead among you , men that spoke the Word of God to you . Consider their behavior and imitate their faith .
Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever .
Do not be carried away by varied different and strange teachings . It is good that the heart is established by grace and not by food . Those who are occupied by them are not benefited .
We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat .
For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the Holy Place by the high priest as an offering for sin , are burned outside the camp .
Jesus suffered outside the gate that he might sanctify the people through his own blood .
Let us therefore go forth to him outside the camp , bearing his reproach .
We do not have a city that continues . We seek after the city that is to come .
Let us continually offer a sacrifice of praise to God through him Jesus , that is , the fruit of lips that make confession give thanks and offer praise to his name .
Do not forget neglect to do good and to communicate fellowship share , for with such sacrifices God is well pleased .
Obey those who lead you . Submit to them : for they watch in behalf of your lives and must account for this . Obey them that their work may be a joy and not a burden ; that would be without gain for you .
Pray for us , for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience . And we wish to live honorably in all things .
I exhort you the more exceedingly to do this , that I may be restored to you the sooner .
Now the God of peace , who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant , even our Lord Jesus ,
make you perfect mature in every good thing . May you do his will , working in us that which is well-pleasing in his sight , through Jesus Christ ; to whom be the glory for ever and ever . Amen .
I urge you , brothers , bear with the word of exhortation . I have written to you in few words .
Do you know that brother Timothy has been released ? If he comes shortly , I will see you .
Greet all those who rule over you , and all the holy ones . They in Italy greet you .
Grace be with you all . Amen .
This letter is from James , a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ . Greetings to the twelve tribes that are scattered .
Count it all joy , my brothers , when you encounter various trials .
Know that the testing of your faith produces patience endurance .
Let patience have its perfect work , that you may be mature , complete , and lacking in nothing .
If any of you lacks wisdom let him ask of God . He gives to all generously and without reproach and it will be given to him .
However he must ask in faith , not doubting : for he who doubts is like a surging wave of the sea driven by the wind and tossed .
Do not let that man think that he will receive anything from God .
A double-minded man is unstable inconsistent in all his ways .
Let the brother of humble circumstances glory in his high position exaltation .
But the rich must be glad when God humbles them . This is because they will wither like wildflowers and pass away .
The sun rises with scorching heat and withers the grass . The flower falls off and its beauty perishes . So also the rich man will fade away in his pursuits .
The man who endures under trial is blessed . For when he has been approved , he will receive the crown of life that God promised to those who love him .
Let no man say when he is tempted : " God tempts me . " God cannot be tempted with evil , and he tempts entices tests trys no one .
Each man is tempted when he is drawn away by his evil desire lust . He is enticed allured .
Then evil desires , when conceived , give birth to sin : and the sin , when it is full grown , brings forth death .
Do not be deceived , my beloved brothers .
Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above . It comes down from the Father of lights truth and spiritual purity , with whom there is no variation . He does not change like shifting shadows .
Using his own will , he gave us birth through the word of truth . This way we would be a kind of first fruits of his creatures .
You know this , my beloved brothers . But let every man be swift to hear , slow to speak , and slow to anger .
The anger of man does not promote the righteousness of God .
Therefore get rid of all filthiness and wickedness . Receive with meekness the implanted word , which is able to save you .
Be doers of the word , and not hearers only , who deceive themselves .
For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer , he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror .
He sees himself , and goes away , and immediately forgets what manner of man he was .
But he who looks into the perfect law , the law of liberty , and so continues , being not a hearer who forgets but a doer who works , this man will be blessed in what he does .
If any man thinks he is religious , while he does not control his tongue but deceives his heart , this man's religion is vain worthless useless .
Pure and undefiled religion before our God and Father is this : to care for the fatherless persons and widows in their affliction , and to keep oneself without spot from the world .
My brothers , keep the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Lord of glory . Do not favor one person over the other .
A man wearing a gold ring and fine clothes and a poor man in shabby clothes comes into your synagogue .
You pay special attention to the one wearing the fine clothes , and say : " Sit here in a good place . " Then you say to the poor man : " Stand there , " or " Sit under my footstool . "
Do not make distinctions among yourselves , and become judges with evil thoughts .
Listen , my dearly beloved brothers ! Did God choose poor people in the world to be rich in faith and to receive the kingdom he promised to those who love him ?
You have dishonored the poor man . Do the rich oppress you , and personally drag you into court ?
Do they blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called ?
When you fulfill the royal law according to the scripture : " You shall love your neighbor as yourself , " you do well .
But when you show partiality you commit sin . The law then convicts you as transgressors .
Whoever obeys the whole law and yet stumbles in one point is guilty of breaking all of it .
For he who said : " Do not commit adultery , " also said : " Do not murder " Greek : phoneuo : kill , slay , murder . Now if you do not commit adultery , but you commit murder , you have become a transgressor of the law .
You should speak and act as men who are to be judged by a law of liberty .
For judgment is without mercy to him who shows no mercy . And mercy triumphs over judgment .
What good is it , my brothers , if a man says he has faith but he does not have works ? Can that faith save him ?
If a brother or sister is without clothes and in lack of daily food ,
and one of you says to them : " Go in peace , be warmed and filled ; " and yet you do not give them food and clothing , what good is it ?
Even so , faith without works is dead . It is alone and by itself !
A man will say : " You have faith and I have works . Show me your faith without the works , and I will show you my faith by my works . "
You believe that there is one God . You do well : the demons also believe , and shudder .
Are you willing to know , O foolish man , that faith without works is useless barren lifeless ?
Was Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar ?
You see that faith acted with his works , and works made faith perfect complete .
The scripture was fulfilled which says : " Abraham believed Jehovah and it was reckoned imputed considered credited to him for righteousness . " He was called » Jehovah’s friend " .
You see that a man is justified declared and pronounced righteous by works , and not by faith alone .
Rahab the harlot was justified by her works . When she received the messengers she sent them out another way .
Just as the body without the spirit is dead ; even so faith without works is dead .
Many of you should not be teachers , my brothers . You know that we will receive a heavier stricter judgment .
We all stumble in many things . If any do not stumble in word , he is a perfect man , able to restrain control the whole body .
We put bits in horses' mouths that they may obey us . We guide their whole bodies .
Look at ships . They are large and are driven by rough winds . Yet a very small rudder can control them , wherever the captain wills .
The tongue also is a little member . It boasts great things . Consider how great a forest fire a small fire kindles !
The tongue is like fire , the place of iniquity among our members . It defiles the whole body , and sets on fire the course of our life . It is set ablaze like the ever-burning fires in the Valley of Hinnom Greek : Gehenna : symbolic of total destruction .
Every kind of beast and bird , of creeping things and things in the sea , is tamed , and has been tamed by mankind .
But no man can tame the tongue . It is a restless evil . It is full of deadly poison .
We bless Jehovah , the Father , with it . Then we curse men , who are made after the likeness of God .
Blessing and cursing come out of the same mouth ! My brothers , these things should not be .
Does the fountain send forth from the same opening sweet water and bitter ?
Can a fig tree , my brothers , yield olives , or a vine produce figs ? Neither can salt water yield sweet .
Who is wise and understanding among you ? Let him show by his good conduct that his works are from meekness because of wisdom .
If you have bitter jealousy envy and greedy ambition in your heart , do not be arrogant and lie against the truth .
This wisdom is not a wisdom that comes down from above , but is earthly , sensual , and devilish .
For where jealousy and selfishness are , there is confusion and every evil deed .
But the wisdom that is from above is first pure , then peaceable , gentle , reasonable yielding , full of mercy and good fruits , without discord partiality , without hypocrisy .
And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for those who make peace .
What causes wars and fighting among you ? Is the cause of fighting your sensual lusts for pleasure that battle within you ?
You lust , and do not have . You murder and covet and cannot obtain ! You fight and war . You do not have because you do not ask .
You ask and do not receive because you ask wrongly with bad motives that you may spend it on your pleasures .
Adulteresses , do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity hatred hostility toward God ? Whoever would be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God .
Or do you think the scripture speaks to no purpose ? Does the attitude of the heart mental disposition that he induced to live in us cause us to envy ?
But he gives more grace . The scripture said , " God resists the proud , but gives grace loving-kindness to the humble . "
Be subject to God ! Resist Satan the Devil and he will flee from you .
Draw close to God , and he will draw close to you . Cleanse your hands , you sinners ; and purify your hearts , you double-minded uncertain doubter skeptic .
Be afflicted , and mourn , and weep : let your laughter be turned to mourning , and your joy to heaviness .
Humble yourselves in the presence of God , and he will exalt you .
Brothers , do not speak against each other . He who speaks against a brother , or judges his brother , speaks against the law , and judges the law . If you judge the law , you are not a doer of the law , but a judge .
Only one is the lawgiver and judge , even he who is able to save and to destroy . Who are you that you judge your neighbor ?
Come now , you that say , " Today or tomorrow we will go to this city , and spend a year there , and trade , and make profit . "
You do not know what will happen tomorrow . What is your life ? For you are a vapor puff of air that appears for a little while and then vanishes away .
You should say , " If God wills , we should both live , and do this or that . "
You glory in your conceit . Such glory is evil .
He that knows to do good , and does not do it , to him it is sin .
Come now , you rich , weep and howl for your miseries that are coming upon you .
Your riches are corrupted , and your garments are moth-eaten .
Your gold and your silver are rusted . Their corrosion will be for a testimony against you , and will eat your flesh like fire . You stored up your treasure in the last days .
Behold , the wages of the laborers who harvested your fields , which are held back by you , cry out : and the cries of them that reaped have entered into the ears of Jehovah of Hosts .
You lived in luxury on the earth , and take your pleasure ; you nourished your hearts in a day of slaughter .
You have condemned , and you have killed the righteous one . He does not resist you .
Be patient , brothers , until the coming of the Lord . Behold , the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth , being patient over it , until it receive the early and late rains .
You also be patient . Make your hearts firm , for the coming of the Lord is near .
Do not complain utter a deep sigh against one another , that you not be judged . Behold , the judge is standing at the door .
Brothers , accept the example of suffering and patience by the prophets who spoke in the name of God .
As you know , those who have endured are called blessed . You have heard of the patience perseverance endurance of Job , and have seen the outcome Jehovah provided , how he was very tender with his affection and mercy .
Above all things , my brothers do not swear by heaven , or by earth , or by any other oath . Let your Yes be Yes and your No be No . That way you will not fall under judgment .
Is any among you suffering ? Let him pray . Is any cheerful ? Let him sing praise .
Is any among you sick ? Let him call the elders of the congregation . Let them pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of God .
The prayer of faith will save the sick person . God will raise him up ; and if he committed sins , it will be forgiven him .
Confess therefore your sins one to another , and pray one for another , that you may be healed . The prayer of a righteous man helps much .
Elijah was a man of like passions with us . He prayed fervently that it might not rain ; and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months .
He prayed again ; and the sky gave rain , and the earth brought forth her fruit .
My brothers , if any among you strays from the truth , and one brings him back ,
let him know , that he who turns a sinner back from the error of his way will save a person from death , and cover a multitude of sins .
Peter , an apostle of Jesus Christ , to the chosen ones who are temporary residents scattered in Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia .
You who are chosen and foreknown by God the Father . You have been sanctified by the Spirit to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with his blood . Grace and peace be greatly increased to you .
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ! According to his great mercy he gave us a new birth to a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead .
You are born to an incorruptible and undefiled inheritance that does not fade away and is reserved in heaven for you .
You are protected by God’s power through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time .
You greatly rejoice in this , though you have been grieved with various trials for a little while .
The proof of your faith is more precious than gold that perishes . Though it is tested by fire , it may be found in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ .
You love him without seeing him . Though you do not see him , you believe in him . Full of glory , you rejoice greatly with indescribable joy .
You receive your salvation as the outcome of your faith .
Concerning this salvation the prophets inquired and searched diligently ! They prophesied about the grace that should come to you :
searching what time or what manner of time the spirit of Christ that was in them did point to , when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ , and the glories that should follow them .
God revealed to the prophets that the things they spoke were not for their own benefit but for yours . The Holy Spirit was sent from heaven to make known to you what the prophets spoke . Those who spread the good news to you did this . These are things even the angels want to look into .
Brace up your minds . Remain sober , and set your hope perfectly on the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ .
Live as children of obedience . Do not fashion yourself according to your former lusts , for you were ignorant at that time .
Be holy in all your conduct , just as the one who called you is holy .
Because it is written : » You shall be holy for I am holy . «
If you call on him as Father , who without respect of persons judges according to each man’s work , pass the time you spend here in reverence .
Know that you were redeemed from your futile way of life inherited from your fathers . The redemption was not with corruptible things like silver or gold ,
but with precious blood , as of a lamb without spot , even the blood of Christ .
Jesus was known before the foundation of the world . He was made known at the end times for your sake .
Through him you believe in God . God raised him from the dead , and gave him glory so that your faith and hope are in God .
You have purified your hearts by obeying the truth . You have genuine affection for the brothers and sisters . So always love one another intensely extremely deeply from the heart .
You have been given a new birth , not of corruptible seed , but of incorruptible , through the word of God , which lives and endures .
All people are like grass . All their glory is like the blossom of a flower . The grass withers and the flower drops off .
But the word of our God abides forever . This is the word of good tidings that was preached to you .
Put away all badness and all deception , hypocrisy , envy , and all evil talk .
Like newborn infants , long for the spiritual milk that is without deception to help you grow to salvation .
You have tasted that the Lord is kind .
You came to him , a living stone , rejected indeed by men , but chosen and precious with God .
You also as living stones are built up as a spiritual house , to be a holy priesthood , to offer up spiritual sacrifices , acceptable to God through Jesus Christ .
The scriptures say : » I lay in Zion a chief corner stone , chosen and precious . He who believes in him will not be disappointed shamed . «
This precious value is for those who believe . But for the unbeliever : » The stone that the builders rejected became the cornerstone . «
It is a stone that people stumble over , and a large rock that people find offensive . They stumble because they are disobedient to the word . To this end they were appointed .
You are a chosen race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , and a people for God’s own possession , that you may show the excellence of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light .
In time past you were no people , but now you are the people of God . You had not then received , but now have received mercy compassion divine kindness .
Beloved , I request that you as aliens and strangers abstain from fleshly lust desires , which causes conflict in you .
Maintain fine behavior among the nations . That way when they speak badly about you , they may see your good works and glorify God in the day of visitation inspection .
Be subject to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake : whether it is to the king ,
or to governors , as sent by him for vengeance on evildoers and for praise to those who do good .
It is God’s will that you do the right things and that this will silence the ignorance of foolish men .
Be free , and yet do not use your freedom for a covering for evil , but as servants of God .
Honor all people . Love the brotherhood . Reverence and respect God . Honor the king .
Servants , be in subjection to your masters with all respect , not only to the good and gentle master but also to the hard to please .
For this is to your credit to suffer wrongfully and endure grief because of your conscience toward God .
What value is there when you sin , and are buffeted for it , you take it patiently ? But if , when you do well and suffer for it , you take it patiently , this is acceptable with God .
For this you were called because Christ also suffered for you . He left you an example a copy for imitation a model that you should follow in his steps .
He committed no sin and deception was not found in him .
When he was reviled insulted , he did not revile in return . When he suffered he did not threaten , but committed himself to him that judges righteously .
He bore our sins in his body upon the stake , that we , having died to sins , might live to righteousness . You were healed because of his wounds stripes .
For you were straying like sheep . But now you have returned to your shepherd and overseer .
In like manner , you wives , be in subjection to your own husbands . Even if your husband does not obey God’s word , he may be won without a word by observing the way you live .
Your husband could see your chaste behavior coupled with respect reverence .
Your appearance should not come from the outward adornment , things like braiding the hair , and wearing jewels of gold , or wearing fine apparel .
Let your appearance be the hidden person of the heart , with the incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit . This is of great value in the sight of God .
The holy women of old , who hoped in God , adorned themselves this way , being submissive to their own husbands .
Sarah obeyed Abraham and called him lord . You are her children now , if you do what is right and are not fearful .
In the same way , you husbands live with your wives in an understanding way . Honor the woman as the weaker vessel . For you are joint-heirs of the grace of life . May your prayers not be hindered cut-off blocked .
Finally , all of you be like-minded , compassionate , brotherly , tenderhearted , and humble .
Do not repay evil for evil , or insult for insult . Do just the opposite . For you were called to inherit a blessing .
Whoever would love life and see good days should keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit .
Let him turn away from evil , and do good . Let him seek peace , and pursue it .
The eyes of Jehovah God are upon the righteous . His ears hear their prayers . But the face person of Jehovah is against those who do evil .
Who will harm you if you are eager to do good ?
Even if you suffer for righteousness’ sake , you are blessed . Do not fear ! Do not be troubled distressed intimidated !
Sanctify the Christ as Lord kurios : master in your hearts . Always be ready to answer every man who asks you a reason for your hope , yet with meekness mildness and respect !
Keep a good conscience . When you are spoken against , those who revile your good manner of life in Christ may be put to shame .
It is better to suffer for doing what is right , if suffering is God’s will , than to suffer for doing evil wrong sin .
Because Christ also suffered for sins once for all , the righteous for the unrighteous , that he might bring us to God . He was put to death in the flesh , but made alive in the spirit .
He preached to the people in prison .
They were disobedient while the ark was being built . Yet God waited patiently in the days of Noah . But few , that is , eight persons , were saved through water .
This was a symbol pointing to baptism , which now saves you . It is not the washing off of bodily dirt , but the promise made to God for a good conscience . It saves you through the resurrection of Jesus Christ .
He is in heaven at the right hand of God , ruling over all angels and heavenly authorities and powers .
Since Christ suffered physically for us , you too must strengthen yourselves with the same way of thinking that he had . Whoever suffers physically has ceased from sin .
From now on you must live the rest of your earthly lives controlled by God’s will and not by human desires lusts .
You have spent enough time in the past doing what unbelievers like to do . Your lives were spent in indecency , lusts , drunkenness , orgies , drinking parties , and the disgusting worship of idols false gods .
They think it strange that you do not run with them in wild and reckless living and they speak evil about you .
They will give account to him that is ready to judge the living and the dead .
The good news was preached for this purpose even to the dead , that they might be judged according to men in the flesh , but may live according to God in the spirit .
The end of all things is near . Be of sound mind and judgment . Also be sober for the purpose of prayer .
Above all things have intense love for one another , for love covers a multitude of sins .
Be hospitable to one another without complaining .
According to the gift you have received , minister among yourselves , as good stewards of the increased grace divine influence love of God .
If any man speaks , speak as it were utterances of God . If any man ministers , minister with the strength which God supplies ! May God be glorified in all things through Jesus Christ . The glory and dominion belong to God forever and ever . Amen .
Beloved ones do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you , for it comes upon you like a test , as though some strange thing were happening to you .
As much as you are partakers of Christ’s sufferings , rejoice ; that at the revelation of his glory you also may rejoice with exceeding joy .
If you are reproached for the name of Christ , you are blessed , because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you .
Let none of you suffer as a murderer , or a thief , or an evildoer , or as a meddler in other people’s business .
If a man suffer as a Christian , let him not be ashamed ; but let him glorify God in this name .
For the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God . If it begins with us first what will it be like in the end for those who do not obey the good news of God ?
If the righteous is scarcely saved , where shall the ungodly and sinners appear ?
Let them also that suffer according to the will of God commend themselves in well doing to a faithful Creator .
I exhort the elders among you . I too am an older man and a witness of the sufferings of Christ . I am also a partaker of the glory that will be revealed .
Shepherd the flock of God in your care . Exercise the oversight , not of constraint , but willingly , according to the will of God . Do not do it for dishonest gain , but eagerly .
Do not lord it over your charge , but make yourselves examples to the flock .
When the chief Shepherd appears , you will receive the crown of glory that does not fade away .
Likewise , you younger men , be subject to the older men . Yes , all of you clothe yourselves with humility and serve one another . God resists the proud , but gives loving kindness to the humble .
Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God , that he may exalt you at the proper time .
Throw all your anxiety upon him , because he cares for you .
Be sober , be watchful : your adversary the devil , as a roaring lion walks about , seeking whom he may devour consume .
Stand firm in your faith , knowing that the same sufferings are accomplished in your brothers in the world .
After you have suffered a little while , the God of all grace who called you to his eternal glory in Christ , will perfect , establish , and strengthen you .
To him is the dominion forever and ever . Amen .
By Silvanus , our faithful brother , as I account him , I have written to you briefly , exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God . Stand fast .
She that is in Babylon , chosen together with you , greets you ; and so does Mark my son .
Greet one another with a kiss of love . Peace be to you all that are in Christ .
Simon Peter , a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ , to those who have obtained a precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God , and of our Savior Jesus Christ :
Grace to you and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord !
His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness . This is through the knowledge of him that called us by his own glory and virtue excellence .
He offered us his precious and exceedingly great promises . Through these you may become partakers of the divine nature . You will escape from the corruption that is in the lust-filled world .
Yes , for this very reason you do your part with all diligence . Supply virtue to your faith . Add knowledge to your virtue .
Include self-control with your knowledge . Supply patience to your self-control . Your patience should be helped by godliness .
Add brotherly kindness to your godliness . And to your brotherly kindness add love .
For if these things are yours and abound in you they will keep you from being inactive or unfruitful regarding the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
For he who lacks these qualities is blind , seeing only what is near , having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins .
Brothers , be more diligent to make your calling and election choosing sure . If you do practice exercise apply these things , you will never stumble !
For in this way the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly abundantly supplied to you .
I will always be ready to remind you of these things . Even though you know them , and are established in the truth that is present with you .
I think it right , as long as I am in this body , to stir you up by reminding you .
I know that putting off my earthly dwelling is imminent , even as our Lord Jesus Christ indicated to me .
I will be diligent so that every time after my departure you will remember these things .
We did not follow cunningly devised fables when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ . We were eyewitnesses of his majesty .
He received honor and glory from God the Father when he heard the voice from the Majestic Glory : » This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased . «
We heard this voice from out of heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain .
We have the word of prophecy made sure steadfast firm ! You do well that you pay attention to God’s Word as you would to a lamp shining in a dark place , until the day dawns , and the daystar rises , in your hearts .
Know this first that no prophecy of scripture is for private interpretation .
For no prophecy ever came by the will of man ! Men spoke from God , being moved by the Holy Spirit .
There arose false prophets among the people . There will be false teachers among you ! They will privately bring in destructive heresies contrary doctrines , denying even the Master who bought them . They bring swift destruction on themselves .
Many will follow their lascivious filthy sensual deeds . The way of the truth will be maligned .
They speak evil words about you because of their extreme greed . They will exploit you with false evil words . Their judgment from long ago is not idle . Their destruction will not delay .
God did not spare angels when they sinned , but cast them down to captivity in pits of darkness reserved for judgment !
He did not spare the ancient world , but preserved Noah , a preacher of righteousness , with seven others , when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly !
He turned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes , condemned them with an overthrow , and made them an example to those who are ungodly .
He delivered righteous Lot , who was very distressed by the lustful life of the wicked .
That righteous man that dwelled among them was tormented by the lawless deeds he saw and heard .
Jehovah knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation , and to preserve the unrighteous for the Day of Judgment .
This is primarily for those who indulge the flesh in its corrupt desires and despise authority . Daring , self-willed , they do not tremble at glorious ones but speak abusively .
Angels , though greater in might and power , do not bring an accusation of abusive judgment against them before Jehovah .
But these are creatures without reason . They were born mere animals to be taken and destroyed ! They speak abusively in matters of which they are ignorant . They suffer destruction in their own course of destruction .
They suffer wrong as their reward for wrongdoing . They are men that count it pleasure to revel in the daytime . They are spots and blemishes , reveling in their deceptions while they feast with you .
They have eyes full of adultery that cannot cease from sin ! They entice unsteady persons . Their hearts are full of covetousness . They are children of cursing .
They went astray , forsaking the right way . They followed the way of Balaam , the son of Beor , who loved the wages of wrongdoing .
He was rebuked for his own transgression . A beast of burden spoke with a man's voice and restrained hindered the madness of the prophet .
These are springs without water , and mists driven by a storm , for whom the gloom of darkness has been reserved .
For , uttering arrogant words of vanity , they entice in the desires lusts of the flesh , by sensuality lasciviousness , those who are just escaping from the ones who live in error .
They promise them freedom , while they are bondservants of corruption . A man is brought into bondage by one and enslaved by another .
After they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , they are again entangled and overcome ; the last state is worse with them than the first .
For it were better for them not to have known the way of righteousness , than , after knowing it , to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them .
It happened to them according to the true proverb : » The dog returns to his own vomit , and the sow that had washed to wallowing in the mire . «
This is the second letter I write to you , beloved . I stimulate your memory in each letter .
You should remember the words that were spoken before by the holy prophets , and the commandments of the Lord and Savior through your apostles .
Know this first , that in the last days , mockers will come with mockery , walking after their own lusts ,
Saying , » Where is the promise of his coming ? For , from the day that the fathers fell asleep in death , all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation . «
For this they willfully forget , that there were heavens from of old , and an earth compacted out of water and amidst water , by the word of God ,
by which means the world that then was , being overflowed with water , perished .
According to the same word , the heavens that now are , and the earth , are reserved for fire , being kept for the Day of Judgment and destruction of ungodly men .
Do not forget this one thing , beloved , that one day is with Jehovah as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day .
Jehovah is not slow concerning his promise , as some count slowness . He is longsuffering patient toward you . He does not wish that any should perish , but that all should come to repentance .
The day of Jehovah will come as a thief . The heavens will pass away with a great noise . The elements shall be dissolved with intense heat . And the earth and the works in it will be burned up destroyed .
Seeing that these things are thus all to be dissolved destroyed , what manner of persons should you be in all holy living and godliness ?
Look for and earnestly desire the coming presence of the » Day of Jehovah . « The heavens being on fire will be dissolved destroyed , and the elements will melt with intense heat !
We look for new heavens and a new earth , where righteousness dwells . This is according to his promise .
Seeing that you anticipate these things , be diligent that you may be found in peace , without spot and blameless in his sight .
Consider the patience of our Lord as salvation . Just as our beloved brother Paul , according to the wisdom given to him , wrote to you .
He spoke about these things in his letters . Some things are hard to understand . The untaught and unstable distort them as they do the other Scriptures , to their own destruction .
You therefore , beloved , knowing this beforehand , avoid being carried away with the error of the wicked and falling from your own steadfastness .
Grow in the unmerited favor and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . To him be the glory both now and forever . Amen .
We have heard that which was from the beginning . We have also seen it with our own eyes . We looked at it and touched it with our hands . It is the Word of life .
The life was made known and we have seen and testify about it . We declare the life to you . It is the eternal life , which was with the Father and was shown to us .
We declare to you what we have seen and heard . This way you may have fellowship with us . Yes , and our fellowship is with the Father , and with his Son Jesus Christ !
We write these things that our joy may be made full complete .
This is the message we heard from him and announce to you , that God is light , and in him is no darkness at all .
If we say we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness , we lie , and do not live practice the truth .
If we walk in the light , as he is in the light , we have fellowship with one another , and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin .
If we say that we have no sin , we deceive ourselves , and the truth is not in us .
If we confess our sins , he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins , and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness .
If we say we have not sinned we make him a liar , and his word is not in us .
My little children , I write you these things that you may not sin . If any man sin , we have an Advocate intercessor comforter helper with the Father , Jesus Christ the righteous !
He is the propitiation Greek : hilasmos : atonement , compensation for our sins . Not for ours only , but also for the whole world .
We know that we know him , when we obey his commandments .
He who says : I know him , and does not obey his commandments is a liar ! The truth is not in him .
Whoever obeys his Word ; the love of God is made perfect complete mature in him . By this we know that we are in union with him .
He that says he lives in union with him should walk as he walked .
Beloved , I write no new commandment to you , but an old commandment you had from the beginning . This old commandment is the word that you heard .
Then again , I do write a new commandment to you . This is true in him and in you . The darkness is passing away , and the true light already shines .
He who says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in the darkness !
He who loves his brother lives in the light , and there is no cause for stumbling offence in him .
But he who hates his brother is in the darkness , and walks in the darkness . He does not know where he goes because the darkness has blinded his eyes .
I write to you , my little children , because your sins are forgiven on account of his name .
I write to you , fathers , because you know him who is from the beginning . I write to you , young men , because you have overcome the evil one . I write to you , little children , because you know the Father .
I write to you , fathers , because you have known him who is from the beginning . I write to you , young men , because you are strong , and the word of God lives in you , and you have overcome the evil one .
Do not love the world or the things in the world . If any one loves the world , the love of the Father is not in him .
The entire world , the desire of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of material wealth , is not from the Father , but is from the world .
The world and its desires lusts are passing away ; but he who does the will of God lives forever .
Little children , it is the last hour ! You heard that the antichrist is coming . Even now many antichrists have come . That is how we know that it is the last hour .
They went out from us , but they were not of us . If they had belonged to us , they would have continued with us . But they went out that it made it plain that they all are not of us .
You have an anointing from the Holy One , and you all know .
I have not written to you because you do not know the truth , but because you know it , and because no lie is of the truth .
Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ ? This is the antichrist , even he who denies the Father and the Son .
Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father . He who confesses the Son has the Father also .
As for you , let that live in you , which you heard from the beginning . If that which you heard from the beginning lives in you , you will also live in the Son , and in the Father .
This is the promise he promised us , life eternal .
I write you these things concerning those who would lead you astray .
The anointing special endowment of Holy Spirit you received from Him is a part of you is with you and you do not need anyone any human to teach you . His anointing taught you concerning all things . It is no lie . It is truth , just as you were taught you live through him .
Now , my little children dwell Greek : meno : stay , dwell , be present with him . If he shall be made known we may have boldness , and not be ashamed before him at his coming presence being near .
If you know that he is righteous you know that every one who practices righteousness is born of him .
Observe the love the Father gave to us that we should be called the children of God . That is what we are ! For this reason the world does not know us . This is because it did not know him .
Beloved , now we are children of God . It is not yet revealed what we will be . We know that when he is revealed we will be like him . We will see him just as he is .
Everyone who has this hope in him is purified . He is pure .
Everyone who practices exercises sin also commits lawlessness , because sin is lawlessness .
You know that he appeared to take away sins . There is no sin in him !
Whoever abides in him does not sin . Whoever sins has not seen him and does not know him .
My little children let no man deceive you ! He who practices righteousness is righteous , even as he Christ is righteous .
He who sins is of the devil . For the devil sinned from the beginning . To this end the Son of God was made known manifested , that he might destroy the works of the devil .
Whoever is born of God does not practice sin ! His seed abides in him and he cannot sin because he has been born of God .
In this the children of God and the children of the devil are revealed . Whoever does not practice righteousness is not from God . He who does not love his brother is not from God .
This is the message you heard from the beginning , that we should love one another !
We should not be like Cain who was of the evil one , and killed his brother . Why did he murder him ? It was because his works were evil , and his brother's were righteous .
Do not be surprised , brothers , if the world hates you .
We know that we have passed out of death into life , because we love the brothers . He who does not love abides in death .
Whoever hates his brother is a murderer ! You know that no murderer has everlasting life remaining in him .
By this we know love , because he Jesus gave his life for us . We ought to lay down our lives for our brothers .
Whoever has this world's goods and sees his brother in need , and shuts up his compassion from him , how does the love of God dwell in him ?
My Little children , let us not love in word , neither with the tongue ; but in deed and truth .
By this we shall know we are of the truth , and will assure our heart before him .
If our heart condemns us , God is greater than our heart , and knows all things .
Beloved , if our heart does not condemn us we have confidence toward God .
Whatever we ask we receive from Him because we obey His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight .
This is his commandment , that we should believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ , and love one another . He gave us this commandment !
The one who obeys God's commandments lives in God , and God lives in with Him . We know that He lives in with us by the Spirit He gave us .
Beloved , do not believe every spirit . Test the spirits to see whether they are from God . This is because many false prophets have gone out into the world .
Here is how you know the Spirit of God , every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ came in the flesh is from God .
Every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God . This is the spirit of the antichrist that you heard was coming and now it is already in the world .
You are of God , my little children . You have overcome them because he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world .
They are from the world . They speak that which is from the world and the world listens to them .
We are from God . He who knows God listens to us . He who is not from God does not listen to us . By this we know the vital principle spirit of truth , and the principle spirit of deception error .
Beloved let us love one another , for love is from God . Everyone who loves is born of God and knows God .
He who does not love does not know God for God is love .
The love of God was made known through us . God sent his only-begotten Son into the world that we might live through him .
In this is love , not that we loved God , but that he loved us , and sent his Son to be the propitiation atonement sacrificial payment for our sins .
Beloved , if God so loved us , we also ought to love one another .
No one has seen God at any time ! If we love one another , God lives with us , and his love is perfected accomplished matured through us .
We know that we live with him and he with us , because he has given us of his Spirit .
We see and testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the world .
Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God , God lives with him , and he with God .
We know and believe the love that God has for us . God is love ! He who continues with love lives with God and God lives with him .
This is love made perfect through us , that we may have boldness in the Day of Judgment . Just as he is , we are , amid exposed to this world .
There is no fear in love . Perfect mature love throws out expels fear because fear involves restraint punishment . He who fears is not made perfect mature complete through love .
We love , because he first loved us .
If a man says , I love God , yet he hates his brother , he is a liar ! He who does not love his brother , whom he has seen , cannot love God whom he has not seen .
We have this commandment from him , that he who loves God should love his brother also .
Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God . Whoever loves him that causes the birth also loves him that is born .
This is how we know that we love the children of God , when we love God and do his commandments .
For this is the love of God , that we obey his commandments . And his commandments are not burdensome .
Everything born from God conquers the world . This is the victory that has conquered the world , even our faith .
Who is the one who conquers overcomes prevails over the world , but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God ?
This is he who came by water and blood , Jesus Christ . He did not come with the water only , but with the water and with the blood . The Spirit gives witness because it is the truth .
There are three that testify : Latin Vulgate : tres testimonium : three that testify .
The Spirit , the water , and the blood , and the three are in agreement accord concurrence harmony . Latin Vulgate : Spiritus et aqua et sanguis et tres unum : Spirit , water , and blood are united .
If we receive the witness of men , the witness of God is greater . The witness of God is this , that he gave witness concerning his Son .
He who believes in the Son of God has the witness in him . He who does not believe God made him a liar because he does not believe the testimony God gives concerning his Son .
The testimony is this that God gave us everlasting life and this life is in his Son .
He who has the Son has the life . He who does not have the Son of God does not have the life .
I wrote these things so you who believe in the name of the Son of God may know you have everlasting life .
This is the confidence that we have toward him , that , if we ask anything according to his will , he hears us .
If we know that he hears us , whatever we ask , we know that we have the petitions requests that we have asked of him .
If any man see his brother committing a sin not leading to death , he will ask , and God will give him life for them that sin not leading to death . There is a sin that leads to death . I do not say that he should make request concerning this .
All unrighteousness is sin : and there is a sin not leading to death .
We know that no one who is born of God practices sin . He who was born from God watches over himself , and the evil one does not touch him .
We know that we are from God , and the whole world lies in the power of the under control of the evil one .
We know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding . We know him that is true for we are in him who is true , and in his Son Jesus Christ . This is the true God and everlasting life .
My little children guard protect yourselves from idols .
The elder to the chosen lady and her children , whom I love in truth ; and not I only , but also all who know the truth .
The truth lives in our hearts forever .
In truth and love , God the Father and Jesus Christ , the Son of the Father send you grace , mercy and peace .
I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth , even as we received commandment from the Father .
Now I ask you , lady , not as though I wrote a new commandment to you , but that which we had from the beginning , that we love one another .
This is love that we walk according to his commandments . This is the commandment that you heard from the beginning . You should walk in it .
For many deceivers have gone into the world . They do not confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh . This is the deceiver and the antichrist .
Watch yourselves that you do not lose the things that we worked to produce . You may receive a full reward .
Whoever pushes ahead and does not remain in the teaching of Christ , does not have God ! He who dwells in the teaching has both the Father and the Son .
Do not receive anyone into your house who comes to you and does not bring this teaching . Give him no greeting !
He who greets him partakes of his evil works .
I have many things to write you . I would not write them with paper and ink : but I hope to come to you , and to speak face to face , that your joy may be made full .
The children of your sister the chosen one greet you .
The elder to the beloved Gaius , whom I love . That righteous man that dwelled among them was tormented by the lawless deeds he saw and heard .
Beloved , I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in good health . May you prosper .
For I rejoiced greatly when brothers came and witnessed about the truth that is in you and that you walk in truth .
I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in the truth .
Beloved , you do a faithful work in whatever you do for the brothers and strangers .
They testify about your love seen by the congregation . You do well to send them forward on their journey worthily of God .
For the sake of the Name they went out , taking nothing from the people of the nations .
We ought to receive and welcome such ones , that we may be fellow-workers for the truth .
I wrote something to the congregation . But Diotrephes , who loves to have the preeminence among them , did not receive us .
If I come , I will remind you of what he does . He unjustly accuses us with wicked words and is never satisfied . He does not allow the brothers to greet one another and he throws them out of the congregation .
Beloved , do not imitate that which is evil , but that which is good . He who does good is from God . He who does evil has not seen God .
Demetrius has the witness of all men , and of the truth itself . Yes , we also testify and you know our witness is true .
I had many things to write to you , but I am unwilling to write them to you with ink and pen .
I hope to see you shortly . We shall speak face to face . Peace to you ! The friends greet you . Greet the friends by name .

Jude , a servant of Jesus Christ , and brother of James , to those who are called , beloved in God the Father , and kept for Jesus Christ :
Mercy , peace and love be multiplied to you .
Beloved , I diligently wrote you about our common salvation . I found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the holy ones .
Certain men crept in unnoticed . They were appointed long ago for this condemnation . These ungodly men turned the grace of our God into loose conduct . They deny our only Master and Lord , Jesus Christ .
I want to remind you though you once knew this , that Jehovah God , having saved a people out of the land of Egypt , afterward destroyed those who did not believe .
Angels who did not keep their position left their proper habitation . He has kept them in everlasting bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day .
Sodom and Gomorrah , and the cities around them are an example for they , in like manner with these surrendered to fornication and went after flesh for unnatural use . They received justice by ever burning fire .
In like manner these men also in their dreams defile the flesh , reject authority and speak evil of glorious ones .
Michael the archangel , when contending with the devil disputed about the body of Moses . He did not speak evil judgment against him in abusive terms , but said : » Jehovah rebukes you . «
These men speak abusively about things they do not know . What they understand naturally , like the creatures without reason , they corrupt themselves .
Woe to them ! They went in the way of Cain , and ran riotously in the error of Balaam for hire , and perished in the rebellious talk of Korah .
These men are hidden rocks in your love feasts when they feast entertain with you . They are shepherds that without fear feed themselves . They are clouds without water , carried along by winds . They are autumn leaves without fruit , twice dead , plucked up by the roots .
They are wild waves of the sea , foaming out their own shame . They are wandering stars , for which the black darkness has been reserved forever .
Enoch , the seventh from Adam , prophesied about these , saying : » Behold , Jehovah came with many thousands of his holy ones .
» They execute judgment upon all . They convict all the ungodly of all their wicked behavior , deeds that they have committed in an irreverent way , and of all the hard things those detestable sinners have spoken against him . «
These murmur , complain , and walk after their lusts , they speak arrogantly , flattering people to gain advantage .
But you , beloved , remember the words spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ .
They said to you : In the last time there will be mockers scoffers , walking after their own ungodly lusts .
These cause divisions ; they are sensual worldly-minded persons not having the Spirit .
You , beloved , build yourself up on your most holy faith , praying in the Holy Spirit .
Stay in the love of God ! Look wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ for everlasting life .
Show mercy to some who have doubt .
Save some , snatch them out of the fire . Have mercy on some with alarm . Hate even the garment defiled polluted by the flesh .
Now to him that is able to guard you from stumbling , and to set you before the presence of his glory without blemish with exceeding joy .
To the only God our Savior , through Jesus Christ our Lord . There is glory , majesty , dominion , and power , before all time , now , and for evermore , amen .
THE REVELATION GOD GAVE TO JESUS CHRIST , so that he could tell his servants the things that must soon take place . Christ then sent his angel to communicate the symbolic message to his servant John .
John testified to the word of God , the testimony of Jesus Christ , and of all that he saw .
Happy is he who reads , and those who hear the words of the prophecy , and obey the things written in it : for the time is near .
John , to the seven congregations in Asia : May you have grace and peace from him who is , and who was , and who is to come ; and from the seven Spirits who are before his throne ;
And from Jesus Christ , who is the Faithful Witness , and the firstborn from the dead , and the Ruler of the kings of the earth . To the one who loves us and released us from our sins by his blood .
He made us to be a kingdom of kings and priests to his God and Father . To him be glory and power forever and ever . Amen .
Behold , he comes with the clouds . Every eye will see him , and those who pierced him ; and all the peoples of the earth will mourn over him . So it will be , Amen .
" I am the Alpha and the Omega , the beginning and the end , " says Jehovah God , " the one who is , and who was , and who is to come , the Almighty all ruling universal sovereign . «
I , John , your brother and companion in tribulation and kingdom and perseverance patience of Jesus Christ , was in the isle that is called Patmos , because of the word of God , and for the testimony of Jesus Christ .
I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day when I heard a strong voice behind me . It sounded like a trumpet .
It said : " Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven congregations in Asia : to Ephesus , Smyrna , Pergamum , Thyatira , Sardis , Philadelphia , and Laodicea . "
I turned to see the voice that spoke with me . When I turned , I saw seven golden lamp stands .
There was someone like the Son of man in the midst of the seven lamp stands . He was clothed with a garment that reached down to the feet , and girded at the chest with a golden girdle .
His head and his hairs were white like wool , as white as snow ; and his eyes were like a flame of fire .
His feet were like fine brass glowing in a furnace . His voice sounded like many rushing waters .
In his right hand he held seven stars . A sharp two-edged sword came out of his mouth . His appearance was like the shinning sun in full strength .
When I saw him , I fell as dead at his feet . He laid his right hand on me and said : " Do not fear . I am the first and the last :
" I am alive ! I was dead and , behold , I am alive forever , Amen . I have the keys of death and the grave .
" Write the things that you have seen and the things that are and the things that will be .
" This is the secret of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand , and the seven golden lamp stands . The seven stars are the angels of the seven congregations . The seven lamp stands that you saw are the seven congregations . "
" To the angel of the congregation of Ephesus write : The one who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven golden lamp stands , says :
" ' I know your works , and your labor , and your patience . I also know how you cannot tolerate those who are evil . You tested those who say they are apostles . They are not apostles . You found them to be liars .
" ' You have endured and are patient . You suffer for my name's sake and have not grown weary .
" ' However I have this against you : you do not love me now as you did at first .
" ' Think how far you have fallen ! Turn from your sins repent and do what you did at first . If you do not turn from your sins , I will come to you and remove your lamp stand from its place .
" ' Yet you have this in your favor : you hate the deeds of the sect of Nicolaus just as I hate their deeds .
" ' He who can hear should listen to what the Spirit says to the congregations ! To him who overcomes I will give the right to eat the fruit of the tree of life that grows in the Paradise Garden of God . '
" To the angel of the congregation in Smyrna write : This is the message from the one who is the ' First and the Last ' , who died and came to life again .
" ' I know your troubles . I know that you are poor , but you are rich ! I know the evil things said against you by those who claim to be Jews but are not . Their synagogue belongs to Satan !
" ' Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer . The devil false accuser Devil is about to throw you into prison , that you may be tested . You will have tribulation ten days . Be faithful even if you must die , and I will give you the crown of life .
" ' He who can hear should listen to what the Spirit says to the congregations . He who overcomes will not be hurt by the second death . '
" To the angel of the congregation in Pergamum write : These are the words of him who has the sharp two-edged sword :
" ' I know where you live and where the throne of Satan is . You cling to my name and have not denied my faith , even in the days of Antipas my faithful witness . He was killed among you , where Satan dwells .
" ' I have a few things against you : you have people there who hold to the teachings of Balaam , who taught Balak to present a snare to the sons of Israel , to eat of idol sacrifices and commit fornication .
" ' You also have those who hold the doctrine teaching of the sect of Nicolaus in like manner .
" ' Turn away from your sins ! If you do not repent I will come to you soon . And I will fight against those people with the sword that comes out of my mouth .
" ' He who can hear should listen to what the Spirit says to the congregations ! To those who overcome in victory I will give some of the hidden manna . I will also give each of them a white stone on which is written a new name that no one knows except the one who receives it . '
" To the angel of the congregation in Thyatira write : This is the message from the Son of God , whose eyes blaze like fire , whose feet shine like polished brass .
" ' I know your works . I know your love , your faithfulness , your service , and your patience . I know that you are doing more now than you did at first .
" ' But I have this against you , that you tolerate the woman Jezebel , who calls herself a prophetess , and she teaches and leads my servants astray so that they commit immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols .
" ' I gave her time to repent , and she does not want to repent of her immorality .
" ' Watch this ! I am going to throw her into a sickbed . Those who commit sexual sins with her will also suffer much trouble , unless they repent and turn away from what she is doing .
" ' I will kill her children with deadly plague . Then all the congregations will know that I am the one who searches hearts and minds . I will reward each of you for what you have done .
" ' But to the rest of you in Thyatira , all who do not hold on to Jezebel's teaching , who have not learned what are called the " deep things of Satan , " I will not burden you with anything else .
" ' Just hold on to what you have until I come .
" ' To the person who conquers and continues to do my works to the end , I will give power authority over the nations .
" ' He will rule them with a rod of iron and break them to pieces like clay vessels : even as I received from my Father .
" ' I will give him the morning star .
" ' He who can hear let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations . ' "
" To the angel of the congregation in Sardis write : He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars says these things : ' I know your works , that you have a name that you are alive , and you are really dead .
" ' Be watchful , and strengthen the things that remain that are at the point of death : for I have not found your works perfect completed before God .
" ' Remember what you received and heard , and hold fast , and repent . If you do not stay awake , I will come to you like a thief . You will not know the hour when I will come to you .
" ' You have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled defiled their garments . They will walk with me in white : for they are worthy .
" ' He who overcomes will be clothed in white garments . I will not blot out his name from the book of life . In fact I will confess his name before my Father , and before his angels .
" ' He who can hear let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations . '
" To the angel of the congregation in Philadelphia write : He says these things . He who is holy , he who is true , he who has the key of David , he who opens and no man shuts , and shuts and no man opens .
" ' I know your works deeds acts . Pay attention , I set before you an open door , and no man can shut it : for you have a little strength , and have kept my word , and have not denied my name .
" ' I will make those of the synagogue of Satan , who say they are Jews , and are not , for they lie ; I will make them come and bow down before your feet . They will know that I have loved you .
" ' Because you have kept the word of my patience endurance , I also will keep you from the hour of testing . This will come upon the whole world to test scrutinize discipline examine those who dwell on the earth .
" ' I come quickly : hold fast what you have so that no one will take your crown .
" ' I will make the one who overcomes , a pillar in the temple of my God , and he will not go out from it anymore . I will write on him the name of my God , and the name of the city of my God , which is the New Jerusalem . This city comes down out of heaven from my God . I will write my new name on him .
" ' He who can hear let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations . '
" ' To the angel of the congregation in Laodicea write : The Amen , the faithful and true witness , the beginning of God’s creation says this :
" ' I know your deeds , that you are neither cold nor hot . I wish that you were cold or hot .
" ' Because you are lukewarm , and neither hot nor cold , I will spit you out of my mouth .
" ' You say , " I am rich and have become wealthy and have need of nothing . " You do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked .
" ' I counsel you to buy gold from me , gold purified by fire , so that you may be rich ; and white clothing , so that you may be clothed . In this way the shame of your nakedness will not appear . And anoint your eyes with eye salve , so that you may see .
" ' I reprove and discipline those whom I love : be zealous therefore , and repent .
" ' Behold , I stand at the door , and knock : if any man hears my voice , and opens the door , I will come in to him , and dine with him , and he with me .
" ' To him that overcomes will I grant to sit with me on my throne , even as I also overcame , and sat down with my Father on his throne .
" ' He who can hear let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations . ' "
After this I saw a door opened in heaven : and the first voice that I heard was talking to me like a trumpet . It said : " Come up here and I will show you things from the future . "
Immediately I was in the spirit . In front of me was a throne in heaven and someone sat on the throne .
He who sat there had the appearance of jasper and sardius stones . A rainbow that looked like an emerald surrounded the throne .
Around the throne were twenty-four elders sitting on thrones . They were dressed in white with crowns of gold on their heads .
Lightnings and thunders and voices came from the throne . There were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne . These are the seven Spirits of God .
A sea of crystal like glass was in front of the throne . In the center around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind .
The first living creature was like a lion . The second living creature was like a young bull . The third living creature had a face like a man . And the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle .
Each of the four living creatures has six wings . They are full of eyes around and within . " Never resting day or night , they say : Holy , holy , holy , Jehovah God the Almighty , who was , and who is , and who is to come . "
When these living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne , who lives forever and ever ,
The twenty-four elders fall down before the one seated on the throne . They worship him who lives forever and ever . They lay their crowns before the throne and say :
" You are worthy , Jehovah our God , to receive glory and honor and power : for you have created all things , and because of your will they are and were created . "
I saw a book in the right hand of him who sat on the throne . It had writing on the inside and on the back and was sealed with seven seals .
And I saw a powerful angel proclaiming with a loud voice : " Who is worthy to open the book , and to remove the seals ? "
No one in heaven , on earth or under the earth was able to open the book and look inside .
I wept much because no one was found worthy to open , look inside , and read the book .
One of the elders said to me : " Do not weep ; the Lion of the tribe of Judah of the Root of David has succeeded in opening the book and removing the seven seals . "
I saw a Lamb that looked as though it had been slain , in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures , and in the midst of the elders . The lamb had seven horns and seven eyes . These are the seven Spirits of God sent into all the earth .
He came to the one who sat on the throne and received the book from his right hand .
When he took the book the four living creatures and twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb . Every one of them had harps , and golden bowls full of incense . These are the prayers of the holy ones .
They sing a new song , saying : " You are worthy to take the book , and to open the seals , for you were slaughtered and by your blood you bought persons for God out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation .
" You made them kings and priests to our God . They will reign as kings over the earth . "
I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders . The number of them was ten thousand myriads times ten thousand , and thousands of thousands .
They said with a loud voice : " The Lamb that was slaughtered is worthy to receive power , and riches , and wisdom , and strength , and honor , and glory , and blessing . "
I heard every creature in heaven and on earth . I also heard those under the earth , in the sea , and all that are in them . They said : " Blessing , and honor , and glory , and power , be to him who sits upon the throne , and to the Lamb forever and ever . "
The four living creatures said : " Amen " and the twenty-four elders fell down and worshipped .
I saw the Lamb open one of the seven seals . And I heard one of the living creatures speak with a voice like thunder . He said : " Come ! "
I saw a white horse . He who sat on it had a bow . A crown was given to him and he conquered .
When he opened the second seal , I heard the second living creature say : " Come ! "
Another horse that was red went out : and power was given to him who sat on it to take peace from the earth . He was given a great sword so that men could kill one another .
When he opened the third seal I heard the third beast say : " Come ! " I saw a black horse ; and he who sat on him had a pair of scales in his hand .
I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures say : " A measure quart : U . S . dry . of wheat for a penny , and three measures of barley for a penny ; and see that you do not hurt the oil and the wine . "
When the Lamb opened the fourth seal , I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say : " Come ! "
I looked , and there was a pale horse . The name of the one who sat on him was Death . The grave followed him . Power was given to them over a fourth part of the earth , to kill with sword , and with hunger , and with pestilence , and with the beasts of the earth .
When the Lamb opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the persons who were slaughtered because of the word of God , and for the witness they gave .
They cried with a loud voice , saying : " How long , O Lord , holy and true , before you judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth ? "
Each of them was given a white robe . They were told that they should rest for a little while . They were to wait until the number of their fellow servants and their brothers , who would be killed , as they were , should be fulfilled .
When he opened the sixth seal I saw a great earthquake . The sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became like blood .
The stars of the sky fell to the earth , even as a fig tree drops her unripe figs when she is shaken by a mighty wind .
The sky was split apart like a scroll when it is rolled together . Every mountain and island was moved from their places .
The kings of the earth , and the great men , and the rich men , and the military commanders , and the mighty men , and every slave and every free man , hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains .
They said to the mountains and rocks : " Fall on us , and hide us from the presence of him who sits on the throne , and from the wrath of the Lamb :
" For the great day of his wrath has come ; and who will be able to stand ? "
After these things I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth . They were holding back the four winds of the earth so the wind would not blow on the earth , or on the sea , or on any tree .
I saw another angel ascending from the east . He had the seal of the living God . He cried out with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea .
He said : " Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees , until we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads . "
I heard the number of those who were sealed . There were sealed a hundred and forty-four thousand from all the tribes of the children of Israel .
Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand .
Of the tribe of Asher were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Naphtali were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Manasseh were sealed twelve thousand .
Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand .
Of the tribe of Zebulun were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand .
After this I saw a great crowd that no man could number . It was from all nations , and tribes , and people , and tongues . It stood before the throne , and before the Lamb , clothed with white robes . They had palm branches in their hands .
They cried with a loud voice , saying : " Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne , and to the Lamb . "
All the angels stood around the throne , and the elders and the four living creatures . They fell before the throne on their faces , and worshiped God .
They said : " Amen ! Blessing , and glory , and wisdom , and thanksgiving , and honor , and power , and might , be to our God forever and ever . Amen . "
One of the elders asked me : " Who are these dressed in white robes ? And where are they from ? "
I said to him : " Sir , you know . " He said to me : " These are the ones who came out of the great tribulation . They washed their robes , and made them white in the blood of the Lamb .
" Because of this they are before the throne of God . They serve him day and night in his temple . He who sits on the throne will spread his tent over dwell among them .
" They will hunger no more , nor thirst any more ; neither shall the sunlight beat down on them , nor any heat .
" The Lamb who is in the middle of the throne will feed them and lead them to living fountains of water . God will wipe away all tears from their eyes . "
When the Lamb opened the seventh seal , there was silence in heaven for about a half an hour .
I saw the seven angels who stood before God . Seven trumpets were given to them .
Another angel , with a golden incense vessel , came and stood at the altar . He was given much incense so he could offer it with the prayers of all the holy ones upon the golden altar before the throne .
The smoke of the incense , with the prayers of the holy ones , ascended up , out of the angel's hand , before God .
The angel took the incense vessel , and filled it with fire from the altar , and hurled it to the earth . There were voices , and thundering and lightning , and an earthquake .
The seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound them .
The first angel blew his trumpet . Hail and fire mixed with blood came down upon the earth . A third of the trees were burned up , and all green grass was burned up .
The second angel blew his trumpet . Something like a great mountain burning with fire was hurled into the sea . A third of the sea became blood .
A third of the living creatures in the sea died . And a third of the ships were destroyed .
The third angel blew his trumpet . A great star burning like a lamp fell from heaven . It fell upon a third of the rivers , and upon the fountains of waters .
The star is called Wormwood Calamity Bitterness : and a third of the waters became wormwood ; and many men died from the waters , because they were made bitter .
The fourth angel blew his trumpet . A third of the sun was struck . A third of the moon , and a third of the stars were darkened . The illumination of both day and night was cut by one third .
Then I saw and heard an angel flying in midheaven . He said with a loud voice : " Woe , woe , woe to those dwelling on earth , because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound ! "
The fifth angel blew his trumpet . I saw a star fall from heaven to the earth . The key of the bottomless pit was given to him .
He opened the bottomless pit . Smoke came out of the pit , like the smoke of a great furnace . The smoke from the pit darkened the sun and the air .
Out of the smoke came locusts upon the earth . Power was given to them like the scorpions of the earth have power .
They were commanded not to hurt the grass of the earth , nor any tree , but only those men who do not have the seal of God in their foreheads .
The locusts were not to kill them , but should torment them for five months : and their torment was the torment of a scorpion , when it strikes a man .
Men will seek death in those days and will not find it . They will desire to die and death will elude them .
The appearance of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle . They wore gold crowns on their heads and their faces were like the faces of men .
Their hair was like the hair of women . Their teeth were like the teeth of lions .
They had breastplates like iron . The sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots with many horses running to battle .
Their tails were like scorpions' tails , for there were stings in their tails . They had power to hurt men five months .
The angel of the bottomless pit was their king . His name in the Hebrew language is Abaddon , and in Greek , Apollyon .
The first woe is past . There are two more woes to come .
The sixth angel blew his trumpet . I heard a voice from the golden altar that is before God .
It said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet , release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates .
And the four angels were released . They were prepared for this very hour , and day , and month , and year , to kill a third of mankind .
The army of the horsemen numbered two hundred million . I heard their number .
I saw the horses and riders in the vision . Their breastplates were bright red , dark blue , and yellow as sulfur . The heads of the horses were like the heads of lions . Their mouths issued fire , smoke , and brimstone .
A third of mankind was killed by these plagues of fire and smoke and sulfur that came out of their mouths .
The power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails : for their tails were like serpents that had heads , and with them they inflict harm .
The rest of the men who were not killed by these plagues did not repent of the works of their hands . They did not stop worshipping demons , and idols of gold , and silver , and brass , and stone , and of wood : which neither can see , nor hear , nor walk .
Neither did they repent of their murders , nor of their sorceries , nor of their fornication , nor of their thefts .
I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven . He was clothed with a cloud . And a rainbow was upon his head . His face was like the sun , and his feet like pillars of fire .
He held a little book that lay open in his hand . He placed his right foot on the sea , and his left foot on the earth .
And he cried with a loud voice , as when a lion roars : and when he had cried , seven thunders uttered their voices .
When the seven thunders spoke , I was about to write : and I heard a voice from heaven say to me : " Seal up those things that the seven thunders spoke . Do not write them . "
The angel I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth raised his hand to heaven .
And he swore by him who lives forever and ever , who created heaven , and the things that are in it , and the earth , and the things that are in it , and the sea , and the things there , that there would be no more delay .
But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel , when he will sound his trumpet , the secret of God is finished , just as he declared to his servants the prophets .
The voice I heard from heaven spoke to me again , and said : " Go take the little book that is open in the hand of the angel who stands upon the sea and upon the earth . "
I went to the angel , and said to him : " Give me the little book . " He said to me : " Take it , and eat it up ! It will be sweet as honey in your mouth , but it will make your belly bitter . "
So I took the little book out of the angel's hand , and ate it . It was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it , my belly was bitter .
He said : " You must prophesy again about many peoples and nations , tongues and kings . "
There was given me a reed like a measuring rod : and the angel stood , saying : " Rise , and measure the temple of God , and the altar , and those who worship there .
" Do not measure the court outside the temple for it is given to the nations . They will tread the holy city under foot for forty-two months .
" I will give power to my two witnesses , and they will prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days , clothed in sackcloth . "
These witnesses are the two olive trees , and the two lamp stands standing before the God of the earth .
If any man will hurt them , fire proceeds out of their mouth , and devours their enemies . If any man will hurt them , he must in this manner be killed .
These two witnesses have power to shut the sky so that it will not rain in the days of their prophecy . They have power over waters to turn them to blood , and to strike the earth with all plagues , as often as they will .
When they finished their testimony , the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit will make war against them and conquer them , and kill them .
Their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city , which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt , where also our Lord was impaled .
The people and tribes and tongues and nations will see their dead bodies three and a half days , and will look at them and refuse to bury them .
The inhabitants of the earth will celebrate and rejoice over them . They will rejoice and send gifts to one another . This is because these two prophets tormented those who lived on the earth .
After three and a half days the breath of life from God entered into them , and they stood upon their feet . Great fear fell upon all who saw them .
They heard a great voice from heaven say : " Come up here . " So they ascended up to heaven in a cloud as their enemies beheld them .
In that same hour there was a great earthquake , and a tenth of the city fell . Seven thousand men were slain in the earthquake , and the survivors were afraid and gave glory to the God of heaven .
The second woe has past . The third woe will come quickly .
The seventh angel blew his trumpet . There were great voices in heaven , saying : " The kingdom of the world has become our God’s , and his Christ will rule as king forever and ever . "
The twenty-four elders , who sat before God on their seats , fell upon their faces , and worshiped God ,
Saying : " We give you thanks , Jehovah God the Almighty , the one who is and who was , because you have taken your great power , and begun to rule as king .
" The nations were angry . Your wrath indignation has come ! It is time to judge the dead , to reward your servants the prophets , the holy ones , and those who reverence your name the small and the great . Time to destroy exterminate eradicate those who destroy the earth . "
The temple of God was opened in heaven . There was seen in his temple the ark of his covenant . And there were lightnings and voices and thunder and an earthquake and great hail .
A great sign appeared in heaven : a woman clothed with the sun , and the moon under her feet , and upon her head was a crown with twelve stars .
She , being with child , cried out in labor pains , ready to deliver .
Another sign appeared in heaven . It was a great red dragon , having seven heads and ten horns , and seven crowns upon his heads .
His tail swept a third of the stars of heaven , and flung them to the earth . The dragon stood before the woman who was ready to be delivered . He was ready to devour her child as soon as it was born .
She gave birth to a male-child , who was to rule all nations with a rod scepter of iron . Her child was caught up to God and to his throne .
The woman fled into the wilderness , where she has a place prepared by God . There they feed her a thousand two hundred and sixty days .
War broke out in heaven . Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and his angels .
The dragon lost and no place in heaven was found for him any longer .
The great dragon was thrown down , that old serpent , called the Devil , and Satan , who deceives the whole world . He was hurled down to the earth , and his angels with him .
I heard a loud voice saying in heaven , " Now has come the salvation , and strength , and the kingdom of our God , and the power authority of his Christ : for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down , who accused them before our God day and night .
They conquered overcame him by the blood of the Lamb , and by the word of their testimony ; and they did not love their lives when faced with death .
Therefore rejoice be glad , you heavens , and you that dwell in them . But woe to the earth and the sea ! For the devil has come down to you , having fierce anger , because he knows that he has only a short time . "
When the dragon saw that he was thrown to the earth , he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male-child .
Two wings of a great eagle were given to the woman , that she might fly into the wilderness , into her place , where she is nourished for a time , and times , and half a time one thousand two hundred and sixty days , out of the serpent's reach .
The serpent spewed water out of his mouth like a flood after the woman , that he might cause her to be carried away by the flood .
But the earth rescued the woman , and the earth opened its mouth , and swallowed up the flood that the dragon spewed out of his mouth .
The dragon was furious with the woman and waged war with the remnant of her seed . These are the ones who obey the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ .
The dragon stood on the shore by the sea . I saw a beast rise up out of the sea , having seven heads and ten horns . His horns had ten crowns on them . Blasphemous names were on his heads .
The beast I saw looked like a leopard . His feet were like the feet of a bear . His mouth was like the mouth of a lion . The dragon gave the beast his power , his throne , and great authority .
One of his heads appeared to have had a fatal wound . His fatal wound had healed , and the entire world followed the beast with admiration .
Men worshiped the dragon that gave power to the beast . They worshiped the beast , saying : " Who is like the beast ? Who is able to make war with him ? "
A mouth speaking great things and blasphemies was given to the beast . And authority to act was given to him to continue forty-two months .
He opened his mouth to blaspheme God , to slander his name , and his dwelling place , and those who live in heaven .
It was granted to him to wage war with the holy ones , and to overcome them : and power was given him over all tribes , and tongues , and nations .
All the citizens of earth will worship him , all whose names have not been written in the Lamb's book of life who was slain from the foundation of the world .
If any man can listen , let him hear .
He who leads into captivity shall go into captivity . He who kills with the sword must be killed with the sword . This requires the patience and the faith of the holy ones .
Then I saw another wild beast coming up out of the earth . He had two horns like a lamb and he spoke like a dragon .
He exercises all the authority of the first beast that came ahead of him . The second beast causes the earth and those who live there to worship the first beast , whose deadly wound was healed .
He performed great signs , so that he made fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men .
And he deceives those who dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles he had power to do in the sight of the beast . He says to those who dwell on the earth , that they should make an image to the beast that had the wound by a sword and yet lives .
He had power to give breath to the image of the beast and to make that image of the beast speak . He caused many to be killed , those who would not worship the image of the beast .
And he forces all persons , the great and the small , rich and poor , free and slave , to receive a mark in their right hand , or in their foreheads .
No one could buy or sell without the mark , the name of the beast , or the number of its name .
This requires wisdom . Let him that has understanding calculate the number of the beast : for it is the number of a man ; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six .
A Lamb stood on Mount Zion , and with him one hundred forty-four thousand , having his Father's name written in their foreheads .
I heard a sound from heaven , as the sound of many waters . It was as the sound of a great thunder : and I heard the sound of harpists playing their harps .
They sing a new song before the throne , and before the four beasts , and the elders . No man can learn that song but the hundred and forty-four thousand , who were redeemed from the earth .
These are they who were not defiled with women . They are virgins . These are they who follow the Lamb wherever he goes . These were redeemed bought from among mankind . They are the first fruits to God and to the Lamb .
No falsehood lie deceit was found in their mouth , for they are without fault .
Then I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven . He had everlasting good news to preach to those who dwell on the earth , to every nation , tribe , tongue , and people .
He spoke in a loud voice : " Respect God , and give him glory ! The hour of his judgment has come . Worship him who made heaven , and earth , and the sea , and the fountains of waters . "
Another angel followed , saying : " Babylon the great has fallen . She has fallen , that great city , because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication . "
The third angel followed them , saying with a loud voice : " If anyone worships the beast and his image , and receives his mark in his forehead , or in his hand ,
" the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God , which is poured out full strength into the cup of his indignation . He will be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels , and in the presence of the Lamb .
" The smoke of their torment will ascend forever and ever . They who worship the beast and his image and receive the mark of his name have no rest day or night .
" This requires patience and endurance for the holy ones , those who obey the commandments of God , and the faith of Jesus . "
Then I heard a voice from heaven say : " Write : Blessed are the dead who die in union with the Lord from this time forward : Yes , says the Spirit , that they may rest from their labors ; and their works follow them . "
I saw a white cloud , and upon the cloud one sat like the Son of man , having on his head a golden crown , and in his hand a sharp sickle .
Another angel came out of the temple , crying with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud : " Thrust in your sickle , and reap ! The time has come for you to reap ; for the harvest of the earth is ripe . "
He who sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth ; and the earth was reaped .
Another angel came out of the temple in heaven , he also having a sharp sickle .
And yet another angel came out from the altar . He had power over fire ; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle . He said : " Thrust in your sharp sickle , and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth ; for her grapes are fully ripe . "
The angel thrust his sickle into the earth , and gathered the vine of the earth , and cast it into the great winepress of the anger of God .
The winepress was trampled outside the city . Blood came out of the winepress as high up as the horse bridles for a distance of one hundred and eighty miles .
I saw another sign in heaven , great and marvelous , seven angels having the seven last plagues . God uses them to finish expressing his anger .
I saw what looked like a sea of glass mingled with fire . Those who were victorious over the beast , and over his image , and over his mark , and over the number of his name , stand on the sea of glass , having harps written Word of God .
They sing the song of Moses , the servant of God , and the song of the Lamb , saying : " Great and marvelous are your works , Jehovah God , the Almighty ; just and true are your ways , you King of the ages Eternal King King of the nations King of the holy ones .
" Who will not reverence you , Jehovah , and glorify your name , for only you are holy . All nations will come and worship you . Your righteous judgments are clearly apparent . "
After that I noticed the temple of the sanctuary of the tent of witness was opened in heaven .
The seven angels with the seven plagues came out of the temple . They were clothed in pure white linen , with their chests girded with golden girdles .
One of the four beasts gave the seven angels bowls full of the anger of God who lives forever and ever .
The temple was filled with smoke from the glory and power of God . No man was able to enter into the temple till the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished .
I heard a loud voice from the temple say to the seven angels : Go your way , and pour out the bowls of the anger of God on the earth .
The first poured out his bowl on the earth . A painful and grievous sore appeared on the men who had the mark of the beast , and upon those who worshiped his image .
Then the second angel poured out his bowl on the sea . It became like the blood of a dead man , and every living being died in the sea .
Then the third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and fountains of waters and they became blood .
I heard the angel of the waters say : " You are righteous , Jehovah , who are , and was , the Holy One , because you have judged these things .
" They have shed the blood of the holy ones and prophets . You give them blood to drink for they deserve it . "
I heard another say : " Even so , Jehovah God the Almighty , true and righteous are your judgments . "
The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun . Authority was given to him to scorch men with fire .
Men were scorched with great heat . They blasphemed the name of God , who has power over these plagues . They did not repent and give him glory .
Then the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast ; and his kingdom became full of darkness . And they gnawed their tongues because of the pain .
They blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains , but they did not repent .
The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates . Its water was dried up so that the way might be prepared for the kings from the east .
I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon , and out of the mouth of the beast , and out of the mouth of the false prophet .
They are demonic spirits , working signs , which go to the kings of the earth , of the whole world . They gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty .
" Behold , I come as a thief . Blessed is he who stays awake and keeps his outer garment , that he does not walk naked and they see his shame . "
He gathered them together to a place called in the Hebrew tongue Har-Magedon .
Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air . A loud voice came out of the temple of heaven . It said : " It is done ! "
There were voices , and thunders , and lightnings . There was a great earthquake , such as was not since men were upon the earth , so mighty an earthquake , and so great .
The great city was divided into three parts , and the cities of the nations fell . God remembered Babylon the Great . He gave her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his anger wrath .
Every island fled away , and the mountains were not found .
There fell upon men a great hail out of heaven , every stone about the weight of a talent 45 to 100 pounds . Men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail , for the plague was exceeding great .
One of the seven angels who had one of the seven bowls spoke to me . He said : " Come , I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters ,
" with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication , and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication . "
So he carried me away in spirit to the wilderness . I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-colored beast . The beast was full of names of blasphemy . It had seven heads and ten horns .
The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet . She was adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls . She had a golden cup in her hand . It was full of abominations and the filthiness of her fornication .
A name was written on her forehead , a mystery , " Babylon the Great , the mother of the harlots and of the abominations of the earth . "
I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the holy ones , and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus . And when I saw her I wondered greatly .
The angel said : " Why do you wonder ? I will tell you the mystery of the woman , and of the beast that carries her , which has the seven heads and ten horns .
" The beast that you saw was , and is not . It will ascend out of the pit and go into destruction . They who dwell on the earth will wonder , those whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world , when they see the beast that was , and is not , and yet is .
" Here is where the mind that has wisdom comes in . The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits .
" There are seven kings : five have fallen , and one is , and the other has not yet come . When he comes he must remain a short while .
" The beast that was , and is not , he is the eighth king , and is from the seven , and goes into destruction .
" The ten horns that you saw are ten kings . They have not yet received a kingdom . But they receive power authority influence as kings for one hour with the beast .
" They are united in one purpose single-minded , and they will give their power and authority to the beast .
" They will wage war against the Lamb , and the Lamb will overcome conquer them : for he is Lord of lords , and King of kings . Those who are with him are called , and chosen , and faithful . "
He says to me : " The waters that you saw , where the harlot sits , are peoples , and crowds , and nations , and languages .
" The ten horns that you saw on the beast will hate the harlot , and will make her desolate and naked . They will eat her flesh and burn her with fire .
" For God put in their hearts the desire to carry out his purpose , and to agree , and to give their kingdom to the beast , until the words of God shall be fulfilled .
" The woman you saw is that great city that reigns over the kings of the earth . "
After these things I saw another angel come down from heaven . He had great authority . The earth was illuminated with his glory .
He cried out with a strong voice : " Babylon the Great has fallen , she has fallen ! She has become the habitation of demons , and a haunt for every unclean spirit . She is a prison for every unclean and hateful bird .
" All nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication immorality . The kings of the earth have committed fornication with her , and the merchants of the earth are very rich through the abundance of her luxury . "
I heard another voice from heaven , say : " Come out of her , my people , that you do not partake of her sins , and that you do not receive her plagues !
" For her sins have reached up to heaven , and God has remembered her iniquities .
" Render to her even as she rendered to you . Pay back double to her , double according to her works : in the cup that she has filled , fill double for her !
" To the extent she glorified herself and lived sensuously , to that extent give her much torment and sorrow . She says in her heart : ' I sit a queen , and am no widow , and I shall see no sorrow . '
" Therefore her plagues literal and figurative will overtake her in one day , death and mourning and famine ; and she will be utterly burned with fire , for mighty is Jehovah God who judges her .
" The kings of the earth , who have committed fornication and lived sensuously with her , will weep and lament over her , when they see the smoke of her burning .
" They will stand at a distance for fear of her torment , and say : ' Woe , woe to the great city Babylon , that mighty city ! For in one hour your judgment has come . '
" The merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her . For no man buys their merchandise any more .
" The merchandise of gold and silver and precious stones , and of pearls , fine linen , purple and silk , scarlet , and everything in scented wood , all manner of ivory and all manner of most precious wood , of brass and iron and marble ,
" cinnamon , odors and ointments , frankincense , wine and oil , fine flour , wheat , beasts , and sheep and horses , chariots and slaves and humans
" The fruits that you desired have departed from you . All things that were dainty and wonderful have departed from you . You will find them no more at all .
" The merchants of these things , who were made rich by her , will stand far off for the fear of her torment , weeping and wailing .
" They will say : ' Woe , woe to the great city , that was clothed in fine linen , and purple , and scarlet , and decked with gold , and precious stones , and pearls !
" ' In one hour these great riches came to nothing . ' Every shipmaster , and all the company in ships , and sailors , and as many as trade by sea , stood far off ,
" and cried when they saw the smoke of her burning , saying : ' What city is like this great city ! '
" They threw dust on their heads , and cried , weeping and wailing , saying : ' Woe , woe to the great city . All that had ships in the sea became rich by her wealth . In one hour she was made desolate . '
" Rejoice over her , you heaven , and you holy apostles and prophets , for God pronounced judgment for you against her . "
A mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone , and hurled it into the sea . He said : " With violence the great city Babylon will be thrown down , and it will not be found any longer .
" The sound of harp players , and musicians , and of pipers , and trumpeters , will not be heard anymore in you . No craftsman will be found in you . The sound of a millstone will not be heard in you anymore .
" There will no longer be the light of a candle in you . The voice of the bridegroom and of the bride will be heard no more at all in you . Your merchants were the great men of the earth ; for by your spiritistic practice all nations were deceived .
" The blood of prophets , and of holy ones , and of all who were slain upon the earth was found in her . "
After these things I heard a great voice of many people in heaven , saying : " Praise Jehovah ! Salvation , and glory , and honor , and power belong to our God .
" True and righteous are his judgments : for he has judged the great harlot , who corrupted the earth with her fornication . And has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand . "
Again they said : " Praise Jehovah . Her smoke rose up forever and ever . "
The twenty-four elders and the four beasts fell down and worshiped God , who sat on the throne , saying : " Amen ! Praise Jehovah ! "
Then a voice came from the throne . It said : " Praise our God , all you his servants , and you who reverence him , both small and great . "
And I heard as it were the voice of a large number of people , and as the sound of many waters , and as the sound of mighty thunder , saying : " Praise Jehovah ! For Jehovah our God , the Almighty , reigns .
" Let us be glad , rejoice , and give honor to him : for the marriage of the Lamb has come , and his wife made herself ready .
" It was granted to her that she dress in fine linen , clean and white : for the fine linen represents the righteous acts of the holy ones . "
He said to me : " Write : Blessed are they who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb . " He said to me : " These are the true sayings of God . "
I fell at his feet to worship him . But he said to me : » Do not do that . I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers . You have the witness from Jesus : worship God ! For the witness from Jesus is the spirit mind-set of prophecy . «
I saw heaven opened , and behold , a white horse ; and he who sat upon him was called Faithful and True , and in righteousness he judges and makes war .
His eyes were like a flame of fire , and on his head were many crowns diadems . He had a name written that no man knew , but himself .
He was clothed with a garment dipped in blood : and his name is called The Word of God .
The armies in heaven followed him upon white horses , clothed in fine linen , white and clean .
Out of his mouth comes a sharp sword , that with it he should strike the nations . He will rule them with a rod of iron . He treads the winepress of the fierceness and anger of Almighty God .
He has on his garment and on his thigh a name written , " King of Kings " and " Lord of Lords " !
Then I saw an angel standing in the sun . He cried with a loud voice to all the fowls that fly in midheaven : " Come and gather yourselves together to the supper of the great God ;
" that you may eat the flesh of kings , and the flesh of military commanders , and the flesh of mighty men , and the flesh of horses , and of those who sit on them , and the flesh of all men , both free and slave , both small and great . "
I saw the beast , and the kings of the earth , and their armies , gathered together to make war against him who sat on the horse , and against his army .
The beast was captured , and with him the false prophet that performed signs before him , with which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast , and those who worshiped his image . These both were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with sulfur .
The rest were killed with the sword that came from the mouth of the one who sat on the horse . All the birds were filled with their flesh .
I saw an angel come down from heaven . He had the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand .
He seized the dragon , the old serpent that is the Devil , and Satan , and bound him for a thousand years .
He hurled him into the bottomless pit , and shut it and sealed it over him . He could not deceive the nations anymore till the thousand years ended . After that he must be let loose for a little while .
I saw thrones , and they sat on them , and judgment was given to them . I also saw the people who were beheaded for the witness of Jesus , and for the word of God . They had not worshiped the beast or his image . They had not received his mark upon their foreheads , or in their hands . They lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years .
[ The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were finished . ] This is the first resurrection .
Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection . The second death has no power over them . They shall be priests of God and of Christ , and shall rule as kings with him for the thousand years .
When the thousand years end , Satan will be let loose out of his prison .
Satan will go out to deceive the nations that are in the four corners of the earth , Gog and Magog , to gather them together to battle . The number of these is as the sand of the sea too great to count .
They advanced over the broad plain of the earth , and encircled the camp of the holy ones , and the beloved city . Fire came down out of heaven and devoured consumed them .
The devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and sulfur , where the beast and the false prophet are , and will be tormented day and night forever .
I saw a great white throne , and him that sat on it . From before him the earth and heaven fled away . There was found no place for them .
I saw the dead , small and great , stand before God . The books were opened : and another book was opened , which is the book of life : and the dead were judged according to the things written in the books , according to their works .
The sea gave up the dead in it . Death and the grave delivered up the dead in them . Every man was judged according to his works .
Death and the grave were hurled into the lake of fire . This is the second death .
Whoever was not found written in the book of life was hurled thrust thrown into the lake of fire .
I saw a new heaven and a new earth : for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away . There was no more sea .
Then I , John , saw the holy city , New Jerusalem , coming down from God out of heaven , prepared as a bride adorned for her husband .
Then I heard a loud voice out of heaven saying : " Behold , the tabernacle of God is with men . He will dwell with them and they will be his people ! God will be with them , and be their God .
" God will wipe away all tears from their eyes . There will be no more death . There will be no more sorrow nor crying . There will be no more pain ! The former things have passed away . "
He who sat on the throne said : " Behold , I make all things new . Then he told me to write : for these words are faithful and true . "
And he said to me : " It is done ! I am Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the end . I will give to him who thirsts from the fountain of the water of life freely .
" He who overcomes will inherit all things . I will be his God , and he will be my son .
" But the fearful and unbelieving , abominable and murderers , fornicators and those practicing spiritism , idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur : which is the second death . "
One of the seven angels came to me . He had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues . He said : " Come here , I will show you the bride , the Lamb's wife . "
He carried me away in spirit to a great and high mountain , and showed me that great city , the holy city Jerusalem , descending out of heaven from God .
She had the glory of God . Her light was like a very precious stone , even like a jasper stone , clear as crystal .
The city had a wall great and high , and had twelve gates , and at the gates twelve angels , and names written on each gate , the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel :
On the east three gates ; on the north three gates ; on the south three gates ; and on the west three gates .
The wall of the city had twelve foundations , and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb .
He who talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city and the gates and the wall .
And the city lies foursquare . The length is as large as the width . He measured the city with the reed , fourteen hundred miles . The length and the width and the height of it are equal .
He measured the wall , two hundred feet , according to the measure of a man , that is , of the angel .
The structure of the wall was jasper : and the city was pure gold , like clear glass .
The foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones . The first foundation was jasper ; the second , sapphire ; the third , chalcedony ; the fourth , an emerald ;
the fifth , sardonyx ; the sixth , sardius ; the seventh , chrysolyte ; the eighth , beryl ; the ninth , topaz ; the tenth , chrysoprase ; the eleventh , hyacinth ; the twelfth , amethyst .
The twelve gates were twelve pearls . Each individual gate was one pearl . The street of the city was pure gold , as transparent glass .
I saw no temple there : for the Jehovah God the Almighty and the Lamb are the temple .
The city did not need the sun or the moon to shine on it . For the glory of God and of the Lamb was its light .
The nations will walk by means of its light . The kings of the earth bring their glory into it .
Its gates will not close in the daytime and there will be no night there .
They will bring the glory of the nations into it .
Nothing impure will ever enter it . The shameful and deceitful will not enter . Only those who are written in the Lamb's book of life will enter .
He showed me a pure river of water of life . It was clear as crystal and flowed out of the throne of God and of the Lamb .
This was in the middle of the street of the city . The tree of life was on each side of the river . It produced twelve kinds of fruit and yielded the fruit every month . The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations .
There will be no curse . The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city . His servants will serve him .
They will see his face and his name will be in their foreheads .
There will be no night there . They need no lamp , neither light of the sun , for Jehovah God gives them light . And they shall reign forever and ever .
Then he said to me : " These sayings are faithful and true . Jehovah the God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show his servants the things that must shortly be done .
" Behold , I come quickly . Blessed is he who obeys the words of the prophecy of this book . "
I John saw these things and heard them . When I heard and saw , I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things .
He said to me : » Do not do that , for I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers the prophets , and of those who obey the words of this book : worship God . «
And he says to me : " Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book , for the time is near at hand .
" He who is unjust , let him be unjust still . And he who is filthy , let him be filthy still . And he who is righteous , let him be righteous still . And he who is holy , let him be holy still .
" ' Behold , I come quickly ; and my reward is with me , to give to every man according as his work .
" ' I am the Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the end , the first and the last .
" ' Blessed are those who obey his commandments . They have the right to the tree of life , and may enter in through the gates of the city .
" ' Outside are the dogs impure men and those who practice spiritism , and fornicators , and murderers , and idolaters , and everyone who tells lies . '
" ' I Jesus have sent my angel to tell you about these things in the congregations . I am the root and the offspring of David , and the bright and morning star . ' "
The Spirit and the bride say : " Come " And let him who hears say : " Come . " And let him who is thirsty come . And whoever will , let him drink the water of life freely .
I testify to every man who hears the words of the prophecy of this book , if any man shall add to these things , God shall add to him the plagues that are written in this book .
If any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy , God shall take away his part out of the book of life , and out of the holy city , and from the things that are written in this book .
He who testifies to these things says : " I come quickly . " Amen . Come , Lord Jesus !
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Amen .
