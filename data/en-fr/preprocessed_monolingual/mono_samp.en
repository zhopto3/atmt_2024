I will proclaim the decree of Jehovah : He said to me : » You are my Son . Today I have become your Father . I have begotten you .
» Do not be like your ancestors and your relatives who were unfaithful to Jehovah the God of their ancestors . He made them something that shocks people , as you have seen .
» I will surely assemble , O Jacob , all of you . I will surely gather the remnant of Israel ! I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah , as a flock in the midst of their pasture . They will make great noise because of the crowd of men .
Tell my lord , King Benhadad , that I agree ; he can have everything I own , Ahab answered .
» Those who act wickedly against the covenant will be perverted by flatteries . However , the people who know their God will be strong and act effectively .
